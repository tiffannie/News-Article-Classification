Alex Cora Re-Hired as Red Sox Manager After 1-Year Suspension,['Paul Kasabian'],"Frank Augstein/Associated Press

The Boston Red Sox have rehired Alex Cora to lead their team, the club announced Friday.

He replaces Ron Roenicke, who Boston fired after one season in charge. He served as Cora's bench coach when Cora managed the Sox in 2018 and 2019.

A Major League Baseball report uncovered that Cora, a former Houston Astros bench coach, played an integral role in Houston's illegal sign-stealing schemes during its 2017 World Series-winning campaign.

The Sox fired Cora on Jan. 14, one day after the report dropped. In April, MLB suspended him for the entire 2020 season.

Boston named Roenicke the interim manager in February and removed the interim tag in April.

Roenicke was in a no-win situation this season, however, as the team sank to a 24-36 record with a roster that had lost much of its talent from its World Series-winning team in 2018. Some remaining talent also struggled mightily in 2020.

The Red Sox went 108-54 in 2018 with an 11-3 mark in the postseason en route to a World Series title under Cora. In 2020, though, they finished dead last in the American League East during a season shortened to 60 games because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In between, the Sox finished third in the AL East with an 84-78 record in 2019, 19 games behind the New York Yankees for first.

A litany of reasons has caused the decline, including the trade of 2018 AL MVP Mookie Betts to the Los Angeles Dodgers as a cost-cutting measure, the decline of slugger J.D. Martinez (1.031 OPS in 2018 versus .680 OPS in 2020) and Tommy John surgery for staff ace Chris Sale. As well, starting pitcher Eduardo Rodriguez missed the 2020 season because of COVID-19 and myocarditis, Boston lost Andrew Benintendi to a rib injury and the pitching staff finished 2020 with a 5.58 ERA.

Other reasons have played into Boston's decline as well, but anything that could have gone wrong for the Sox lately has gone wrong as the team scuffles its way into a new decade.

The Red Sox will hope Cora helps restore the glory days and change the franchise's fortunes after a rough couple of years."
"Report: Steelers, Mike Tomlin Fined $350K Total for Mask Violations vs. Ravens",['Tim Daniels'],"Keith Srakocic/Associated Press

The Pittsburgh Steelers were fined $250,000 and head coach Mike Tomlin was docked $100,000 for mask violations amid the coronavirus pandemic during Sunday's Week 8 win over the Baltimore Ravens.

ESPN's Adam Schefter reported the news Friday.

On Thursday, Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson reported the Las Vegas Raiders will be fined $500,000 and lose a sixth-round draft pick for COVID-19 violations as a ""repeat offender"" following offensive tackle Trent Brown's positive test. Head coach Jon Gruden will be fined $150,000.

Meanwhile, the NFL announced nine players from five different teams were added to the reserve/COVID-19 list Thursday.

The concern is amplified as the United States surpassed 100,000 cases of the coronavirus each of the past two days, including a single-day record of 121,000 positive tests Thursday, per CNN's Christina Maxouris.

After making it through the first three weeks of the regular season unscathed, the NFL went through a rough patch where multiple games were postponed either for a few days or multiple weeks. All games over the last three weeks were completed.

Thursday night's contest between the Green Bay Packers and San Francisco 49ers moved forward even though three members of the Niners were among those added to the reserve list. The Packers won 34-17.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in October that ""flexibility is going to be critical"" in order to finish the season.

""We cannot grow complacent—not the players, not of the coaches, not the rest of personnel,"" Goodell told reporters. ""Ninety percent is not good enough in this environment.""

The league has managed to remain on course to finish the regular season in its typical 17 weeks. Whether that will remain possible as teams continue to use their bye weeks and reduce the flexibility in the remaining schedule is unclear.

ESPN's Chris Mortensen reported Monday the NFL competition committee is considering an alternative plan that would allow eight playoff teams in each conference, an increase of one in both the AFC and NFC, should games be canceled because of COVID-19 concerns.

For now, Super Bowl LV remains on track to take place Feb. 7 in Tampa, Florida."
Dolphins Assistant Tests Positive for COVID-19; MIA in NFL's Intensive Protocol,['Tim Daniels'],"Matt Patterson/Associated Press

The Miami Dolphins announced Friday they've entered the NFL's intensive coronavirus protocol after an assistant coach tested positive for COVID-19 ahead of Sunday's Week 9 game against the Arizona Cardinals.

Here's the team's full statement:

The Dolphins are still expected to have a walkthrough practice later Friday and remain scheduled to face the Cardinals, per Tom Pelissero and Mike Garafolo of the NFL Network.

Miami joined the Atlanta Falcons, who also announced a positive test among its staff, in entering the more intensive protocols. The Falcons are going to work virtually Friday.

A troublesome trend is beginning to develop after nine players from five teams were added to the reserve/COVID-19 list Thursday. The United States continues to see a rise in cases, reaching an all-time high of more than 121,000 new positives Thursday, per CNN's Christina Maxouris.

The NFL showed a greater tolerance of playing despite coronavirus concerns by allowing Thursday night's game between the Green Bay Packers and San Francisco 49ers after three members of the Niners roster were put on the reserve list earlier in the day.

After the league played the first three weeks of the regular season without issue, the next two weeks were filled with schedule alterations that included moving bye weeks around to keep the campaign within the typical structure of 17 weeks.

Such changes will become harder moving forward as teams use their bye week, so there will be additional pressure to play games if the league office wants to avoid adding a week to the end of the season to ensure each club plays its full slate.

Preparations are being made in case that's not possible, though. ESPN's Chris Mortensen reported Monday the NFL competition committee is considering a 16-team playoff field, with one extra team from each conference, if the coronavirus ultimately leads to an unbalanced schedule.

That said, so far no changes have been made to the Week 9 schedule.

The Dolphins and Cardinals are set for a 4:25 p.m. ET kickoff Sunday at State Farm Stadium."
"NBA Players, Owners Agree to 72-Game 2020-21 Season Starting Dec. 22",['Joseph Zucker'],"Mark J. Terrill/Associated Press

The NBA will be back before the year is over.

On Thursday, the National Basketball Players Association confirmed its representatives tentatively approved a 72-game season that will begin Dec. 22.

Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium first reported the sides had agreed to a deal.

Charania and ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski provided more details:

This news was widely expected. The New York Times' Marc Stein reported Wednesday that ""all the momentum on the player side"" pointed toward training camps on Dec. 1 ahead of the regular season three weeks later.

The Athletic's David Aldridge also spoke to an agent who referenced the potential consequences of eschewing the tabled proposal:

With the COVID-19 pandemic putting the 2019-20 season on hold, one question among many was how it would disrupt the league's calendar going forward. The NBA Finals didn't conclude until Oct. 11, which made the traditional mid-to-late October start for the next year all but impossible.

One line of thinking was that the NBA would stand by until the development of a COVID vaccine allowed for fans to return to arenas in big numbers again. Some stadiums have admitted fans in other leagues, albeit well below capacity.

The drawback to that approach is that it's unclear when a vaccine will be forthcoming.

In a September interview with Bob Costas for CNN, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said that January was his ""best guess"" on a start date. He added that one goal would be to play games in home arenas with fans but that a number of logistical issues needed to be resolved on that front.

However, Charania reported on Oct. 23 that the NBA league office told its board of governors Dec. 22 was the new tentative target.

ESPN's Wojnarowski and Brian Windhorst provided some more context. The plan would see the regular season shortened from 82 games to 72 and the 2021 All-Star Game canceled. The report stated the NBA was ""abandoning plans to delay the opening with hopes of incorporating fans back into arenas.""

Windhorst explained one reason behind Dec. 22 specifically during the Oct. 26 episode of his Hoop Collective podcast. TNT would be able to air the Los Angeles Lakers' season opener, when their players will collect their NBA championship rings, and ESPN would have its regular slate of Christmas Day games.

Wojnarowski and Zach Lowe provided the possible financial ramifications: ""The league believes that a Dec. 22 start that includes Christmas Day games on television and allows for a 72-game schedule that finishes before the Summer Olympics in mid-July is worth between $500 million and $1 billion in short- and long-term revenues to the league and players, sources said.""

Any proposal from the league needed the players' approval, and Charania noted how a Christmas-time opening was ""quicker than expected,"" alluding to a level of resistance that could grow.

Lakers swingman Danny Green posited on The Ringer NBA Show that some of his teammates, including LeBron James, might choose to sit out for an extended period to allow themselves a little extra rest:

Not every team was in the same position as the Lakers and Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat, though. The eight franchises that didn't travel to the Walt Disney World Resort bubble haven't played since March, and those that didn't make deep postseason runs will have had a slightly more traditional offseason in terms of length.

Without a further reduction in the number of games, a December start was arguably the only alternative if the NBA wanted to revert back to its regular October-April regular-season calendar for 2021-22."
"Report: Raiders Fined $500K, Jon Gruden Fined $150K After Trent Brown COVID Test",['Blake Schuster'],"Isaac Brekken/Associated Press

The Las Vegas Raiders have been fined $500,000 and stripped of a sixth-round draft pick after the NFL concluded the organization again broke COVID-19 protocols, according to Charles Robinson of Yahoo Sports.

The league began investigating after a positive test was confirmed for offensive tackle Trent Brown in late October. Head coach Jon Gruden has also been fined $150,000.

This is the first time the NFL has revoked a draft pick from a team for violating COVID-19 protocols.

The Raiders were one of the first teams penalized for not properly wearing masks on game day this season. Gruden was fined $100,000 while the organization was forced to pay $250,000. In total, the NFL has now taken $1.2 million in fines from Las Vegas as well as a pick.

According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, the league found multiple violations of the health and safety guidelines agreed to by the NFL and Players Association, including Gruden's failure to consistently wear a face mask, players attending a large indoor gathering and allowing unauthorized personnel into its locker room following a game.

The penalties come at the end of a week where multiple teams have seen COVID-19 outbreaks shut down their facilities including a number of clubs that have already been fined for not adhering to the the coronavirus protocols.

The San Francisco 49ers and Denver Broncos have both had employees test positive this week with multiple Niners starters forced to miss Thursday's game against the Green Bay Packers.

Study: NFL to Absorb $2.7 Billion Deficit Because of Reduced Fan Attendance,['Adam Wells'],"Adam Hunger/Associated Press

While it was already known the NFL was going to see reduced profits in 2020 because of limited tickets sales as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, there's now a rough estimate of just how significant the financial losses could be.

Per a study conducted by Team Marketing Report (h/t The Athletic's Bill Shea), the NFL is looking at a potential $2.7 billion deficit by not having full fan attendance in stadiums this season.

Using the ticket sale price for all 32 teams coming into this season, the Fan Cost Index study estimated the cost to attend a single game is $553.

That figure includes ""four adult non-premium tickets, single-car parking, two draft beers, four soft drinks, four hot dogs and two adult-sized adjustable hats.""

Shea cited the Las Vegas Raiders as the ""easiest"" example of how the FCI projected number was determined:

""It's 59 percent higher than last year, when the club was still playing in Oakland, because of a nearly 75 percent surge in the average ticket price at the new stadium—not an uncommon practice when a team gets a new venue. That said, the Raiders opted this season to not have any fans at games until the health crisis has lifted and officials permit full attendance at the $2 billion stadium.""

The Raiders had the highest estimated average FCI at $783.36. No other team in the NFL had an average higher than $667.22 (San Francisco 49ers).

The Washington Football Team is estimated to lose the most money this season by not having full attendance at FedEx Field ($124.1 million).

Per Statista, the league's 32 teams earned 15.02 percent of their total revenue from gate receipts in 2019.

The NBA and NHL finished their seasons in isolated locations without fans in the stands. The WNBA held a reduced regular season and playoffs at IMG Academy in Florida. Major League Baseball didn't allow fans in the stands until the National League Championship Series and World Series.

The NFL is allowing teams to work with local health officials in their cities to determine fan attendance capacity for games. There are currently 17 teams that allow reduced percentage capacity."

Rafik Hariri: Guilty verdict for lead suspect in killing of former Lebanese prime minister,"['Mostafa Salem', 'Nada Altaher', 'Ben Wedeman']","(CNN) The lead suspect in the 2005 bombing that killed former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was convicted at a tribunal in the Netherlands on Tuesday.

Salim Jamil Ayyash was found guilty of being part of the ""red cell phone network"" involved in the planning of Hariri's assassination.

The other three defendants, Assad Sabra, Hassan Oneissi and Hassan Habib Merei, were found not guilty at the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) in The Hague. The hearing ruled that there was no evidence of their involvement in the bombing.

Koala populations in decline due to increased human impacts on nature,['Lauren Kent'],"(CNN) It has been a stressful year for Australia's koalas. Their health and natural environment, however, have been under threat for a long time.

Bushfires, habitat fragmentation, vehicle collisions and dog attacks -- all which hurt koalas -- have been getting worse over the last decade.

That has led to species population decline and increased disease among koalas, according to new research published Wednesday in the academic journal PLOS ONE

The number of diseased koalas increased over the course of 30 years, while the number of sick koalas that could be released back into the wild dropped, the study said. It analyzed 29 years' worth of data on koala sightings and animal hospital admissions from three wildlife rescue groups in New South Wales, Australia.

A combination of environmental impacts and human disturbance of koala habitats, researchers found, have made Australia's iconic marsupials vulnerable to extinction.

""In the last 10 years, we can see koala rescues ramped up significantly because more koalas are being found out in the open and on the ground,"" said lead author Edward Narayan, a senior lecturer of animal science at the University of Queensland.

That's not a good sign for a tree-dwelling species. For their survival, koalas rely on eucalyptus trees, which they use for food but also to find refuge and breed.

On top of injuries and deaths due to habitat loss and human encroachment, researchers say koalas are at risk because long-term stress is hurting their immune systems.

Environmental degradation, rising global temperatures and droughts have led to more koalas falling to the ground because tree leaves dry out and no longer have enough water or nutrients, according to researchers at the University of Sydney in a separate study.

Over and beyond koala injuries and deaths due to habitat loss and human encroachment, Narayan said koalas are in danger because long-term, chronic stress is hurting their immune systems.

""Humans have all these artificial coping mechanisms to cope with stress, but with animals, the problem is that most small animals are good at hiding their fear,"" Narayan said. ""You cannot tell if an animal is sick or not unless it becomes very sick.""

The most common reason a koala was reported or admitted for clinical care was disease -- including signs of infections, poor body condition and organ damage, the University of Queensland study data revealed.

""We also found that the disease cases are increasing, so there are more koalas found with higher prevalence of chlamydia, which is one of the diseases that affects koalas,"" Narayan told CNN. ""As a result, more koalas are having to be euthanized, unfortunately.""

Human impact on koalas

Human population growth has had an increasingly negative impact on koala populations through a variety of stressors, according to Narayan.

""One of the biggest factors is land clearance,"" Narayan said. ""What's happening is koalas are facing more and more pressure on the outskirts of the cities. That habitat corridor is more vulnerable ... we can see these bubbles of new housing development impacting koalas.""

Agriculture also plays a role in the decline of koalas, as more natural land is cleared for agricultural development, Narayan added. Sustainable agriculture practices and nature conservation, the study's researchers argue, are vital for saving koalas.

Climate change is also contributing to the decline of koalas. For example, droughts lead to more dehydrated koalas and fewer healthy trees for them to call home.

And Australia experienced record-breaking bushfires in 2019 and 2020, which were likely made worse by climate change , according to a report by the New South Wales Bushfire Inquiry. Fires are nothing new in Australia, but they have been becoming more intense and more destructive in recent years, a problem exacerbated by the climate crisis.

Almost a third of koalas in New South Wales may have been killed in recent bushfires , which also destroyed about a third of their habitat, Australia Minister for the Environment Sussan Ley said in December 2019.

WWF aims to double koala numbers

World Wide Fund for Nature - Australia in early October launched an ambitious plan called Regenerate Australia that aims to double koala numbers on the country's east coast -- in part by planting seeds to grow more trees that grow koala food.

Policy makers, farmers and everyday citizens need to focus more on environmental preservation in order to protect koalas and other Austalian wildlife, researchers say.

Planting more trees is essential following a bushfire season that wiped out 7 billion trees and killed an estimated 3 billion animals, WWF said.

""Unprecedented damage calls for an unprecedented response,"" WWF Australia CEO Dermot O'Gorman said in a statement.

O'Gorman added that efforts to double koala numbers by 2050 would also benefit many other species as well as boost the economies of regional communities.

""WWF is excited to trial specialised drones, with some models capable of planting 40,000 seeds a day, to create corridors so that koalas and other wildlife can move across a landscape fragmented by fire and land clearing,"" he said.

Policy makers, farmers and citizens need to focus more on environmental preservation -- not only for the health of koalas, but also for the health of the planet and future generations, Narayan said.

""The koalas carry the voice of Australia's environment,"" he said, adding that their decline alludes to a larger crisis in the natural world. ""The amount of damage that has been to the planet -- we can't hide from it.

""Eventually what will happen with this effect on nature is that we will be creating our own grave, in a way,"" Narayan added. ""If animals are sick, if frogs don't sing, and if koalas can't breathe, then that's a good sign that the natural environment is no longer healthy."""

FDA advisory panel not convinced of new Alzheimer's disease drug's effectiveness,['Jacqueline Howard'],"(CNN) An advisory committee to the US Food and Drug Administration largely concluded in a meeting on Friday that there is not enough evidence to support the effectiveness of the experimental Alzheimer's disease drug aducanumab -- and thus clinical data do not support approving the treatment.

The FDA is now expected to consider the committee's opinions and then decide whether to approve the drug or pump the brakes. That decision may not happen for some time -- possibly not until next year.

Approval would mark a major milestone; it would be the first approval of a new Alzheimer's drug in nearly 20 years.

On Friday, the FDA's Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to vote on several questions about evidence of the drug's effectiveness. The drug, administered through intravenous infusion for early Alzheimer's disease, was developed by the pharmaceutical company Biogen and its Japanese partner Eisai.

In response to a question about whether it was reasonable to consider data from one positive study as the primary evidence of aducanumab's effectiveness for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, none of the committee members voted yes -- 10 voted no and one was uncertain.

Expert panel questions drug's effectiveness

In response to one question about whether the positive study provides ""strong evidence"" that supports the effectiveness of aducanumab for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, one committee member voted yes, eight voted no and two were uncertain.

And in response to a separate question about whether another smaller study provided supportive evidence of aducanumab's effectiveness, none of the committee members voted yes -- seven voted no and four were uncertain.

""There's a huge danger in approving something that turns out not to be effective,"" said Dr. Joel Perlmutter, a committee member who voted mostly ""no"" in response to questions of whether evidence supported aducanumab's effectiveness.

""If we approve something when the data is not strong, we have a risk of delaying good treatments and effective treatments for more than a couple of years, for many years,"" Perlmutter said in Friday's meeting.

Committee member Dr. G. Caleb Alexander, who also voted ""no"" or ""uncertain"" to questions, agreed: ""This is such an important application to get right because of the overwhelming imperative for new treatments.""

Panel member 'highly critical' of FDA presentation

During the meeting, some of the committee members also raised concern that questions and data were presented to the panel in a way that was biased, ""one-sided"" or favorable to the drug.

""I'm highly critical of the fact that the FDA presentation today was so heavily weighted to just giving the same conclusions that the sponsor did,"" committee member Dr. Scott Emerson said, referring to Biogen.

Earlier in the meeting, Alexander said, ""I find the material the FDA provided strikingly incongruent.""

In a statement Friday night, Biogen acknowledged the committee votes and thanked those who shared their thoughts and experiences at the meeting.

""We will continue to work with the FDA as it completes its review of our application,"" Michel Vounatsos, Biogen chief executive officer, said in the statement.

The FDA could decide to contradict the committee's votes and approve aducanumab. But such a decision would be controversial.

""One would expect this advisory committee will have a lot of influence,"" Rudolph Tanzi, a Harvard professor of neurology and director of the Genetics and Aging Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, told CNN on Wednesday. He was not involved in the meeting.

In March 2019, Phase 3 clinical trials of aducanumab were discontinued because a futility analysis found the trials were unlikely to meet their primary goals at completion.

But several months later, Biogen announced that a new analysis, which included more patients, showed that those who received aducanumab experienced a significant reduction in clinical decline in one trial. Results for some patients in another study supported those findings, as well.

Then in July, Biogen completed its submission to the FDA for a Biologics License Application for approval of the drug.

If approved, aducanumab would become the first immunotherapy to reduce the clinical decline of Alzheimer's disease and would also be the first therapy to demonstrate that removing amyloid beta, a hallmark of the degenerative brain disorder, resulted in better clinical outcomes.

An array of 'completely different opinions'

The influential Alzheimer's Association supports approval of the drug and submitted a letter of support ahead of Friday's meeting saying that ""there is a dire and drastic need to offer relief and support to the millions of Americans impacted each day by the crushing realities of Alzheimer's.""

In a separate testimony, the nonprofit Public Citizen's Health Research Group said that the FDA should not approve aducanumab for treatment of Alzheimer's disease due to lack of evidence of its effectiveness.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

Approving the drug ""is likely to result in far more harm than good,"" Michael Carome, director of the group, said in a written statement on Thursday.

There are diverse opinions among clinicians and researchers around whether aducanumab should be approved, Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian in New York, who had patients in the original aducanumab clinical studies, told CNN on Wednesday.

""A handful of the most respected scientists and researchers in our field have completely different opinions,"" Isaacson said. ""Whatever the decision is, it's a watershed moment for the field of Alzheimer's disease."""
Pandemic restrictions could make for a lighter flu season,['Terry Ward'],"(CNN) As Colorado was bidding a final farewell to any hopes of a lingering summer after a surprise snowstorm covered much of the state, Kara Williams had a realization.

""It hit me,"" Williams, 51, an empty nester in Carbondale, said. ""It's getting colder, the heat is on, and I'm not sick.""

The change of seasons usually ushers in predictable cold symptoms she'd grown accustomed to dealing with several times a year.

""Typically, my colds start with a scratchy throat, I know I'm getting sick when I get that. So I usually take some Zicam to ward it off,"" she said. ""Then it goes from my throat to my nose, and usually lasts a week, unless it gets into my lungs.""

Williams realized she had last had a cold in January, and she is sure it's due to the pandemic precautions she has been taking — including social distancing, not going to large gatherings, wearing a mask when she's shopping, using hand sanitizer and washing her hands constantly.

If you're also noticing you're not suffering from the seasonal sniffles, sneezes and coughs of pre-pandemic times, there is an explanation.

Social distancing also curtails flu spread

""It's absolutely because of the precautions we are taking,"" CNN Medical Analyst and emergency physician Dr. Leana S. Wen said in an earlier interview. ""The same precautions that protect us against coronavirus also protect against cold, flus and respiratory pathogens.""

""It's the fact you're keeping your distance, wearing a mask, washing your hands more, that you're attentive that someone might have the illness and not know it,"" said Wen, who is a professor of public health at George Washington University.

""In the past, it might have been acceptable to be sneezing and cough a little and still go to work or school, and now that would not be acceptable,"" she said. ""That reduces the risk of transmission, too.""

Wen pointed to Australia's milder flu season during its winter months as further indication that ""the same precautions used to protect against coronavirus also reduced instances of the flu.""

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, noted that Australia had the fewest number of flu cases ""in memory"" during its winter flu season, from April to September.

""They almost, as they call it, had an absent flu season,"" said Fauci, speaking with Washington, DC, radio station WTOP on September 17. ""The theory is that all the precautions they took to contain the pandemic actually ""averted a flu season.""

Both Fauci and Wen, however, said that this is not the time to get complacent.

""Right now, there's a coronavirus storm all over the country,"" Wen said. ""The virus is surging in most parts of the country. We are entering an extremely concerning time for (Covid-19). This is the time for us to be hunkering down — what's been driving the most recent surge is gatherings with family and friends.""

Go with what's available

If you haven't already gotten your flu shot, the time is now. The start of flu season in the Northern Hemisphere is usually November, Wen said, and it's best to get vaccinated before November.

""If you look at the data over many years about flu vaccines, they're not perfect,"" Fauci said. ""We know from the data that flu shots not only prevent infections; they prevent people who do get infected from getting serious progressive disease sometimes resulting in hospitalization.""

Fauci credited the flu shot, wearing masks, avoiding crowds, keeping physically distanced and frequent hand-washing as the actions that may have protected people in the Southern Hemisphere this winter.

""There is no coronavirus vaccine but here is a flu vaccine, and it's important for us to do the things that we can,"" Wen said. ""With what's essentially the twindemics of the flu and coronavirus, get the vaccine to protect at least against one.""

Stay vigilant

Since Covid-19, the flu and the common cold share some symptoms — including headaches, body aches and feeling generally unwell, Wen said it's going to be ""extremely difficult to sort out who has what, especially with the limited testing that we have.""

""These respiratory pathogens have a seasonal pattern,"" she said. ""They increase in spread when people are congregating indoors more. Viruses can linger longer when there's less humidity in the air, and colder weather in the winter means less humidity indoors.""

Indoors with her inner circle in the cold Colorado winter is where Williams, who recently got her flu shot, plans to ride out much of the coming cold and flu season, she said.

""It's getting colder here and I joke to my husband, 'OK, we're going into hibernation, this is it,'"" she said. ""I think we're going to have a healthy winter.""

People should continue good public health hygiene practices that help prevent the common cold and flu post-pandemic, too, Wen said,""such as staying home when they're feeling sick, frequently washing hands, and making sure they are up-to-date on their vaccines."""
The 'dose' of coronavirus a person gets may determine how sick they get; masks could help,"['Dr. Sanjay Gupta', 'Andrea Kane']","Basically, it means that any substance can become toxic if given at a high enough concentration. Even too much water can throw off your electrolytes and be potentially fatal.

Viewing the coronavirus through that lens -- that the ""dose"" of the virus you receive might make the difference between being asymptomatic, getting mildly sick or becoming critically ill -- may be helpful when thinking about protection against Covid-19 as the colder temperatures arrive and cases spike.

SARS-CoV-2 likely behaves like other viruses

The concept of needing a certain dose of a pathogen -- a disease-causing organism -- to trigger an infection has been shown to be the case for many viruses, such as the influenza virus, poxviruses and others, explained Erin Bromage, an associate professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth.

""If you hit an animal with a low enough dose, they'll be able to fend that off without developing any disease at all. If you get a magic number of an infectious dose, an infection will establish and that animal will then succumb to the disease from that particular pathogen. But if you hit them with more than the infectious dose, in most situations a high dose of pathogens -- like a high dose of a virus, for example -- leads to more severe outcomes. So, dose becomes really important,"" he said, calling the relationship ""dose-dependent.""

It's not because you need a certain number of particles of virus to infect a cell -- it just increases the odds that one of those viral particles will make it into the cell and infect it, setting off the chain reaction.

Another way to think of it is like conception: You don't need millions of sperm to fertilize an egg -- you only need one -- but men make millions of sperm to improve the chances that one will reach the egg, overcome its defenses and fertilize it.

Getting a viral dose all at once or spread out over time

There's another dimension to viral dose and it has to do with time. It's not the dose of the virus you get simply at one point in time that matters; it may also be the sum of viral doses you get over a certain period of time.

""Some people are speculating about it: Is this why, for example, bus drivers or people working in emergency rooms are more likely to have more adverse outcomes? Because they're exposed to higher doses, or because they're in an environment where they get exposed to it over an extended period and get a larger swath of it into them?"" asked Bromage.

In mid-October, of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its definition of ""close contact"" to include multiple, brief exposures that add up to 15 minutes or more with an infected person. Previously, the CDC defined a close contact as 15 minutes of continuous exposure to an infected individual.

It's not only about the virus, it's also about the host

The virus itself isn't the only organism that plays a role -- it also has to do with the individual.

""Each person has a different amount of virus that they need,"" said Bromage. ""Somebody that is immunosuppressed, or somebody that is stressed, for example, may need less of a [virus] challenge in order to get the same outcomes as somebody that is in a healthy condition.""

Put it all together, and the chance of infection depends on the physiology of the potential host, as well as their personal behaviors and health habits such as smoking status, diet, physical activity and sleep. An elderly or unhealthy host in the face of large, recurrent exposures is clearly the worst case scenario. But a medically fragile person could be sickened by even a low dose of virus; conversely, a healthy person can be overwhelmed with a high enough dose.

One tragic example is the death of the young and seemingly healthy doctor Li Wenliang in Wuhan, China. On December 30, 2019, he privately raised the alarm after seeing seven cases of a SARS-like illness among patients at his hospital; four days later he was accused by the police of ""severely disrupting social order,"" and ""spreading rumors online."" Shortly after spending time caring for those critically ill patients, Li developed symptoms of Covid-19; he died less than a month later. He was only 34.

Still, we are just talking about odds and likelihoods. Pinning down the exact scenario that leads to infection is much harder to do.

""We simply can't study the exact viral dose that would make someone sick because it's completely unethical,"" said Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease doctor and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. That's because it would mean knowingly exposing people to progressively higher doses of the virus to determine when an infection occurs.

""I don't think we're going to actually get to that value. We can in animals -- there's been a ferret model and there's been a hamster model -- now two animal models where the more you give them the more sick those animals get and that is helpful, and it may give us a sense. But we won't know with humans, unfortunately, how much it takes,"" she said.

Viral dose and viral load

""There is an interesting two-sides-of-the-coin dance coming out between viral [dose] -- what goes in -- and viral load -- what comes out,"" said Gandhi. Viral load is the amount of virus an infected person has in their body; some, but not all, studies have shown that the sicker a patient is with Covid-19, the higher the viral load.

""If you get less of a viral dose in, then you can calmly take care of it and wall it off. You have this asymptomatic infection and maybe you are less likely to produce a high viral load; you produce a lower viral load, and thus it's related to less severe disease,"" she said.

She noted that in places and situations that had adopted universal masking -- such as on an Argentine cruise ship and at several US food-processing plants -- the asymptomatic infection rate, at above 80%, was more than double the CDC's estimated asymptomatic infection rate of approximately 40%. The mask appears to lower the dose by filtering out some of the viral particles.

The connection between masks and vaccines

There is, however, another fascinating and important way to think about virus dosing. If the dose is small enough, it may not cause illness but could still generate an immune response, similar to a vaccine. This is a remarkable and critically important concept.

In fact, Gandhi and her coauthor, Dr. George Rutherford from the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at UCSF, wrote a perspective piece in the New England Journal of Medicine in September putting forth the argument that by wearing a mask, a person, if exposed, would get a smaller dose of the virus than they otherwise might -- preventing illness but still triggering the body's immune system.

In her article, she and Rutherford drew the comparison with ""variolation,"" which is what a similar process was called when people were deliberately exposed to a bit of smallpox matter from a sick person in order to create immunity. This was before the introduction of the smallpox vaccine.

""We're going to give them a teeny bit of virus and they're going to get just a teeny bit sick and then they'd develop an immune response -- and it totally worked,"" she said.

It could also help explain why some people never develop symptoms of Covid-19, but still have antibodies to the virus. But more research will need to be done to confirm that.

Because people can't control if, let alone how much, of a viral dose they get, Gandhi reiterated what most all public health experts have been saying we should do to stay as safe as possible: maintain physical distance from those not in our household, choose outdoor spaces over indoors, practice good hand hygiene and -- please -- mask up!"
1918 pandemic vs. 2020 pandemic: Lessons of the second wave,['Kristen Rogers'],"(CNN) In the deadly fall wave of the 1918 flu pandemic, millions of people were doomed because they didn't know what we know now about how viruses and respiratory illnesses spread.

We might face a similar fate if some people continue to ignore what a centuryof scientific progress and hindsight have taught us about ending pandemics.

The 1918 pandemic transpired in three waves, from the spring of 1918 to the winter of 1919 — ultimately killing 50 million to 100 million people globally. The first wave in the spring of 1918 was relatively mild. A majority of 1918 flu deaths occurred in the fall of 1918 — the second, and worst, wave of the 1918 flu.

The St. Louis Red Cross Motor Corps was on duty with mask-wearing women holding stretchers at the backs of ambulances during the influenza epidemic in Missouri in October 1918.

Health experts expect Covid-19 infections to increase this winter because the virus that causes Covid-19 is a coronavirus, and other coronaviruses spread more during winter. In wintry, less-humid air, virus-carrying particles can linger in the air longer. Additionally, our nasal membranes are drier and more vulnerable to infection in winter. And as the weather gets colder, we spend more time indoors without sufficient ventilation, which means the virus has a higher likelihood of spreading.

Covid-19 hasn't ""claimed as many lives yet as did influenza. Basically, around 675,000 people died in the US by the end of the 1918 pandemic,"" said Dr. Jeremy Brown, an emergency care physician and author of "" Influenza: The Hundred-Year Hunt to Cure the Deadliest Disease in History ."" ""That would, today, be around 3 million people in the US. The good news is that we haven't seen those numbers — of course, the numbers are really quite appalling.

""But, of course, the story that we're talking about isn't over yet,"" Brown said.

Why the second wave was so deadly

There are several possibilities why the 1918 second wave was so horrible, including a virus that possibly mutated and patterns of human movement and behavior at the time. Winter meant that influenza also spread more and people were indoors more often.

""My guess is it wasn't great at infecting people in the spring and had to sort of adapt,"" said John M. Barry, author of "" The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History ."" ""Then a mutation took over that was very good at infecting people and also more virulent.""

In 1918 flu patients, pneumonia often quickly developed and killed people by the second day. Efforts for the First World War had taken over, so rampant spread was facilitated by troop movements and crowded military camps.

Where military personnel traveled, so did the virus — resulting in influenza and pneumonia sickening 20% to 40% of the US Army and Navy personnel in the fall, interfering with induction, training and efficacy. ""Influenza and pneumonia killed more American soldiers and sailors during the war than did enemy weapons,"" a 2010 study reported.

The 39th Regiment marched through the streets of Seattle in December 1918, while wearing masks made by the Seattle Chapter of the Red Cross.

""Here was Vaughan, in the midst of the first war to use modern weapons, a war that was felling young men with machine guns and gas warfare, and yet it was all nothing compared to this illness,"" Kolata wrote.

An immense obstacle was a lack of knowledge of the virus' character, behavior and severity. The pandemic came before awareness of what a virus looked like and how to isolate and learn it. The vengeance of the second wave led some people and doctors to think they were dealing with a disease different than what had plagued them that spring.

The announcing of the armistice on November 11, 1918, was the occasion for a grand celebration in Philadelphia. Thousands of attendees were infected with influenza.

Flu deaths peaked in November 1918, which was possibly the deadliest month of the pandemic. A Philadelphia parade held on Armistice Day on November 11 gave thousands of attendees the flu.

The social impact

The 1918 flu ripped at the fabric of society. Roughly half of the deaths were among young adults ages 20 to 40, in contrast to the current pandemic, with older adults more likely to experience serious illness and death from Covid-19.

Many events, schools and public spaces were canceled and closed. ""'The ghost of fear walked everywhere, causing many a family circle to reunite because of the different members having nothing else to do but stay home,'"" wrote Kolata, quoting an Arizona newspaper.

Female clerks in New York work with masks tied around their faces on October 16, 1918.

Authorities imposed mask-wearing and anti-spitting laws . City officials inflicted punitive measures including fines against people who broke the rules. The Provost Marshal General of the US Army in October canceled a draft call of 142,000 men, despite Europe's need for them.

The toll on adults in their prime meant that many children lost one or both parents. The world lost generations of young people , and for them the pandemic and World War I became the central experiences of their lives.

Modern-day advantage

Now, let's fast-forward to the year 2020. Multiple scientific advances have allowed us a slight advantage in mitigating the spread and effects of respiratory illnesses like the flu and Covid-19. Technological improvements have allowed researchers to view cells and viruses through electron microscopes and X-ray crystallography, which also enables capturing millions of images of them. Microbiologists can now isolate, identify and describe the structure of viruses.

Although we have coronavirus tests, one shortcoming is ""that we don't have sufficient testing ability and the tests take so long,"" Kolata said. ""And when you start having something like the coronavirus where the symptoms can mimic those of the flu — high fever, chills — you can overwhelm the testing system really easily if the flu season really gets underway.""

Thankfully, we're not in a global war. Hindsight and years of scientific progress have taught us how respiratory illnesses spread by encounters with respiratory droplets facilitated by close contact and insufficient hygiene. However, to be effective, these scientific and medical advantages require public compliance.

What we can do

Though Covid-19 cases are increasing and could spike this winter, there are things we can do to stem the spread. Precautions such as physical distancing, avoiding gatherings and unnecessary travel, hand-washing and mask wearing are still important.

considerate of others — can help limit trips to stores, thus decreasing chances of spread. Stocking up on grocery, medical and emergency preparedness items — responsibly and in a manner that'sconsiderate of others — can help limit trips to stores, thus decreasing chances of spread.

In 1918, there wasn't an approved and regulated vaccine. This time around with coronavirus, Operation Warp Speed and other programs are testing vaccines to be able to inoculate the public potentially by spring 2021.

(CNN) One of the great cliffhangers of the historic 2020 election has been if Democrat Joe Biden will win against President Donald Trump in the state of Georgia. While the final tally is still unknown, one conclusion is inescapable: Republicans can no longer count on Georgia as a bastion they dominate.

Frida Ghitis

That may come as a surprise to many. After all, no Democratic presidential candidate has won the state since Bill Clinton in 1992. And both of its current US senators, as well as the governor, are devout Trump Republicans.

But many Georgia voters -- including myself -- are not surprised by this turn of events. In fact, some of us openly disagreed , when, on election night, data crunchers said Georgia was almost certain to go to Trump.

Not only does the state now appear poised to go to Biden, but both of its Senate seats are likely going to a January run-off. And if they do, the outcome could hold the key to which party controls the Senate in 2021.

Forget stereotypes about the South. Millions of Georgians are liberal, anti-racist and pro-decency. The population has exploded by nearly a third since 2000 , including with arrivals from other countries and other states. Georgia is becoming less white, much more diverse and less conservative. The 6th Congressional District, once held by Republican stalwart Newt Gingrich, has been won twice by Democrat Lucy McBath, an African American who launched her political career after losing her son to gun violence."

(CNN) In 2019, incumbent Republican Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin was down in the vote totals to challenger Democrat Andy Beshear by about 5,000 votes out of around 1.4 million votes cast . But Bevin refused to concede, claiming unspecific election "" irregularities ,"" with no evidence whatsoever.

Sound familiar?

Bevin acknowledged defeat only after several prominent Republicans told him to produce evidence of election fraud or else concede the race.

Although nothing is official until state election authorities certify the results, the Electoral College votes on December 14 and Congress counts those votes on January 6, the continuing, lawful vote tabulation in several states suggests that Donald Trump has lost his bid for reelection. It is now time for leading Republicans, such as Sens. Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham, as well as former President George W. Bush, to speak up. They must demand that Trump cease his dangerous language that casts doubt on the legitimacy of the election and -- unless he has real evidence -- end his baseless lawsuits that seek only to further undermine people's faith in the outcome.

Some Republicans have begun to distance themselves from Trump, but not boldly or unequivocally. Former New Jersey governor and Trump adviser Chris Christie merely said that there was "" no basis "" to make the argument on Tuesday night that Trump had won. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, without mentioning Trump by name, placidly tweeted , ""The result of the presidential race will be known after every legally cast vote has been counted."" Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum said that Trump's language at Thursday's news conference was "" shocking ,"" but he did not wholly debunk Trump's unfounded conspiracy theories -- though he did at least say that the President should provide evidence of his claims.

But that's not good enough. We need a strong and absolute rebuke of this undermining of American democracy from Trump's most fervent supporters at the highest echelons of the Republican Party.

Of course, there's no legal requirement that a candidate concede. So long as the official vote totals are consistent with current trends and projections, former Vice President Joe Biden will assume the presidency on January 20, 2021, regardless of what Trump says.

But a concession could help the country move forward in a peaceful manner. It could help Trump supporters recognize that he lost legitimately. And it could renew people's faith in our electoral system.

That's what happened last year in Kentucky.

Bevin continued to claim ""irregularities,"" suggesting that there were ""thousands of absentee ballots that were illegally counted,"" voters being ""incorrectly turned away,"" and ""a number of machines that didn't work properly."" But he had no evidence. Two Bevin voters then made unsubstantiated allegations of vote ""hacking,"" again without evidence -- though Bevin promoted the voters' news conference.

The same needs to occur now. Trump has signaled for months that he would not accept defeat. He said that in 2016 , too.

But the situation is different now because, it appears, Trump has lost. The question of whether he will agree to a peaceful transfer of power is now squarely before us.

It's not enough for Democrats to oppose Trump's delegitimizing language. They have been doing it for years. It is not enough for journalists or election law professors to explain why Trump's message is so dangerous.

Republicans need to make a choice: How much do they value American democracy and the norms that must sustain it? The longer they wait, the longer Trump can create chaos among his supporters. The longer they wait, the more doubt he sows about the true winner of this election. The longer they wait, the more fragile our institutions will become."
2019 Kentucky Governor General Election Results,['The New York Times'],"See all Kentucky results ›

Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin conceded to Attorney General Andy Beshear after a recanvass of votes confirmed Mr. Beshear’s victory in the 2019 governor’s election. Read more

The governor's race in Kentucky had been cast as a showdown between an unpopular governor and an unpopular party. Mr. Bevin had focused his campaign on his alignment with President Trump and his opposition to impeachment, with the president holding a rally on Monday in Lexington to reciprocate the support. Mr. Beshear has been buoyed by the governor's diminished popularity — Mr. Bevin is among the least popular governors in the country.

Mr. Bevin's approval has plummeted over cuts in government services he pushed for and his brash handling of a teacher walkout, calling protestors ""selfish"" and ""ignorant,"" and blaming them for hypothetical sexual assaults and the actual shooting of a 7-year-old girl."
Bevin cites 'irregularities' in asking for Kentucky recanvass,[],"“What we know is that there really are a number of irregularities,” he said, adding that “there’s more than a little bit of history of vote fraud in our state.”

Without providing details, Bevin cited “thousands of absentee ballots that were illegally counted,” reports of voters being “incorrectly turned away” from polling places and “a number of machines that didn’t work properly.” He said his campaign would provide more information as it is gathered, and he did not take questions from reporters.

""We simply want to ensure that there is integrity in the process,"" Bevin said at the close of his statement. ""We owe this to the people of Kentucky.""

Beshear, who declared victory Tuesday night, is eager to move on and seal his lead in the vote count. At a Wednesday morning press conference in Louisville, where both candidates spent election night, Beshear said he was formally launching his transition team, with only about a month to go until the scheduled Dec. 10 inauguration.

“We’re confident in the outcome of the election, but today is about moving forward,” Beshear said. “The election is over. No one else is going to cast a vote. It ended last night.”

The Associated Press has declined to call the contest, citing the relatively tight margin and Bevin’s protest.

The recanvass means Kentucky's 120 counties will check their voting machines and absentee ballots to ensure they were counted correctly, but they will not examine individual ballots. Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes said the recanvass will be conducted on Nov. 14.

In his comments to reporters, Bevin also criticized Grimes for her role as the state’s top elections official. He was specifically bothered by Grimes telling CNN Tuesday night that Beshear had won the race and cited a number of scandals surrounding the outgoing Democratic officeholder, including the conviction of her father, Democratic powerbroker Jerry Lundergan, for illegally funding Grimes’ 2014 Senate campaign against Sen. Mitch McConnell.

“This is a family and an office that have been very corrupt,” Bevin said.

The gubernatorial recanvass will be the first statewide audit in more than three years. In the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, Hillary Clinton led Bernie Sanders by 1,924 votes after the initial count. The state-paid recanvass didn’t change the totals for any of the candidates by even a single vote.

If Bevin decides to seek a recount, he would have to pay for it. As of Oct. 21 — the last report filed with the state’s Registry of Election Finance — his campaign still had $846,000 in cash on hand, though it likely used much of that on TV advertising and other campaign operations in the closing weeks of the race.

There is a nuclear option for Bevin. As all the votes were counted Tuesday night, a prominent Kentucky Republican was reportedly floating the possibility that — should Bevin exhaust his options with the election authorities — the governor could contest the result with the state legislature, which is controlled by Republicans and could overrule the final vote count.

“There’s less than one-half of 1 percent, as I understand, separating the governor and [Beshear],” state Senate President Robert Stivers told the Louisville Courier Journal. “We will follow the letter of the law and what various processes determine.”"
Opinion: LGBTQ rights may be safe at the Supreme Court -- for now,['Opinion Tim Holbrook'],"Tim Holbrook is Asa Griggs Candler Professor of Law at Emory University School of Law. He is a frequent commentator on LGBTQ rights. The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) When Justice Amy Coney Barrett was nominated to serve on the Supreme Court, many lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) persons were concerned about what impact she may have on their rights, including marriage equality. She did not make them feel comfortable in her confirmation hearing when she referred to "" sexual preference ,"" a term viewed by gays and lesbians as derogatory because it suggests that sexual orientation is a choice. She did apologize for using the term.

The LGBTQ community may not need to wait long to see her views. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard arguments in the case of Fulton v. City of Philadelphia. On the surface, the case presents the clash of religious liberties and the rights of LGBTQ people. Specifically, the issue is whether Philadelphia infringed on the religious liberties of Catholic Social Services (CSS) by refusing to renew its contract for providing foster care services because CSS would not work with same-sex couples. Many suspect that the Supreme Court may use the case as a vehicle to begin to carve out religious liberty exemptions from civil rights protections for LGBTQ persons.

LGBTQ Americans have considerable and understandable anxiety about the future of their rights. There have been significant advances at the Supreme Court, with the court legalizing same-sex marriage in the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision and extending federal law to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity this summer in Bostock v. Clayton County

With Justice Barrett's appointment, many LGBTQ Americans and their families fear those gains are at risk. Indeed, opinions in each of those decisions explicitly called out concerns of religious liberty; Justice Clarence Thomas said in a 2015 dissent in Obergefell that the majority decision undermined religious liberty; and in the majority opinion in Bostock Justice Neil Gorsuch suggested that religious liberty questions could arise in future employment discrimination cases.

On its surface, this new case seems primed for the court to curtail LGBTQ rights in light of religious liberties.

The oral argument in the case , however, showed that Fulton v. City of Philadelphia is far from simple. Its factual and legal complexities make it hard to predict the outcome -- and also provide several levers the justices can use to reach a decision that does not squarely address the limits that religious liberty may place on non-discrimination, civil rights laws and marriage equality. Because the case is so complicated, it seems far more likely that the court will take a path allowing it to reach an outcome that does not undermine those rights, at least for now.

From a legal perspective, I heard several key questions that may determine the fate of the case.

Is the Philadelphia law one of ""general applicability""?

The oral argument revealed disagreement as to whether the city's prohibition on discrimination against LGBTQ persons was generally applicable, which means it applies across the board without exception and, thus, without targeting religious activity. In a 1990 decision written by Justice Antonin Scalia, Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith , the court held that Oregon could prohibit sacramental use of the hallucinogenic drug peyote because the law prohibiting the use of the drug was neutral and generally applicable, without any exceptions. So, no exemptions. In contrast, arguably there are some exceptions permitted to Philadelphia's non-discrimination law for placing children.

The court grappled with this standard here because the city had created exceptions in the foster care context to other non-discrimination protections. For example, Philadelphia does permit the consideration of race or disability in determining whether to place a child with a family. But, as Justice Barrett noted , ""none of them are for the same-sex anti-discrimination requirement."" Moreover, the city contended that those exceptions apply only to the placement decision and not to the question of whether a couple should be able to serve as foster parents at all.

The ambiguity surrounding whether a law is generally applicable has led to criticism of Employment Division. Justice Barrett may well be called to overrule a decision authored by her mentor Scalia, for whom she clerked. Because Employment Division has been questioned, the court could use this case as a vehicle to end that approach.

Is CSS a government contractor, or is Philadelphia licensing the foster care activity?

To most, this distinction would not be important. But, in this context, it could determine the outcome and allow the court to avoid confronting the vexing intersection of religious liberties and marriage equality. Undisputedly, governments can create requirements for those who contract to provide governmental services. While government contractors do not lose their constitutional protections, those rights can be outweighed by the government's legitimate interests. This is because the city could simply perform the activity itself and create reasonable restrictions on its employees.

In contrast, if the city is licensing such activity, like licenses for barbers, then such restrictions must advance a compelling government interest if there is an impingement of religious freedoms. The justices seem split over how to characterize the relationship between CSS and the city in this case. Justice Sonia Sotomayor clearly views this as a contractual arrangement, stating, ""It's a lovely argument, but I'm having a very hard time accepting how, when the City sets forth a set of criteria, only these people can do this work for me. That's not a license. That's an employment contract.""

Justice Barrett asked if it was possible for ""any entity to participate in the recruitment and certification of foster families without a contract from the City?"" The city conceded that, no, they cannot. The implication of Justice Barrett's question is that these contracts are effectively a license because, without a contract, a group cannot engage in providing foster care at all.

What could the impact of this decision be on other forms of non-discrimination protections?

The oral argument made clear that the justices are acutely aware of the implications for other forms of non-discrimination protection. Justices Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Elena Kagan, Sotomayor and Barrett all asked questions based on the hypothetical of a foster care agency declining to work with interracial couples based on their religious beliefs. The petitioner Fulton argued that, under Supreme Court decisions, race is different and that no agency could do so. The United States federal government, supporting Fulton's position, also suggested that racial discrimination is simply different.

Justice Kagan did not seem to accept that argument. She asked the United States, ""If I understood you correctly, you said that it is a compelling state interest to eradicate racial discrimination, but it is not a compelling state interest to eradicate discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation."" She then pushed further asking, ""Do you think it is a compelling state interest to want to eradicate discrimination against gays and lesbians?"" Justice Breyer seemed incredulous that the petitioner and the United States were asking the court to write an opinion stating that racial discrimination is somehow different than discrimination on the basis of gender, religion, national origin, and sexual orientation.

Is there an issue here at all?

Some of the justices, such as Justices Breyer and Brett Kavanaugh, asked whether there is actually a problem in the case. CSS says it had never refused to work with a same-sex couple and would simply refer them to an agency that would work with them. In this manner, there would seem to be no harm to accommodating CSS's religious views. Of course, Philadelphia argued that it should be able to act to prevent any such discrimination and should not have to wait for it to arise. And another agency, Bethany Christian Services, did actually refuse to work with a same-sex couple, though Bethany later agreed to the non-discrimination principle

""Our faith calls us to work with vulnerable children and families and therefore, it is important that Christians remain in this space,"" Bethany said in a statement. ""To that end, while we will remain compliant with the law, we also remain committed to our Christian beliefs and core values."" Indeed, the Bethany concern triggered the review that led CSS to inform Philadelphia Commissioner of Human Services Cynthia Figueroa it would not work with same-sex couples.

The characterization of this case as being about LGBTQ rights versus religious liberties, therefore, is too simplistic. The justices carefully explored the nuances in the case and the potential collateral consequences of their decision.

Of course, two justices have already showed their hands on this issue. Justices Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Samuel Alito, decried the impact of marriage equality on religious liberties in a case involving Kim Davis, a Kentucky government employee who refused to issue marriage certificates to same-sex couples due to her religious convictions. If those justices thought that there should be a religious liberty exemption for an actual state employee, they may be willing to carve one out in the arguably easier case of a government contractor. And we likely will see how Justice Barrett views these issues.

Nevertheless, the complexity of this case suggests the Supreme Court will address the issue as narrowly as possible, doing its best to balance the interests in religious liberties and LGBTQ rights. We may not (yet) know Justice Barrett's views on LGBTQ rights, and the case may be unsatisfying to those on both sides of the issues. And that may be the right outcome."
Amy Coney Barrett was criticized for using the term ‘sexual preference.’ Should we care?,"['Patrick R. Grzanka', 'Associate Professor Of Psychology', 'University Of Tennessee']","It was a brief moment of levity for me in the otherwise stressful confirmation hearings when President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett used the term “sexual preference” in response to a question from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) about legal protections for “the LGBT community.”

“Sexual preference” is one of those outdated terms that people said in what my mother calls polite company. Like when you weren’t sure if you were allowed to just say “gay.” Frankly, it makes me roll my eyes. I would be straight, but I prefer not to be.

So, when two senators proceeded to chastise Barrett and the Internet exploded over her use of the term, I was bewildered. Surely, the nominee might oppose same-sex marriage and civil protections for LGBTQ people. But is “sexual preference” the smoking gun of thinly veiled homophobia?

Never mind that neither the terms sexual “preference” nor “orientation” capture gender identity and therefore erase the “T” in “LGBTQ,” Barrett’s comments and the reactions to it highlight the persistently contentious nature of sexual identity politics. Even slight deviation from the “born this way” narrative of innate, unchangeable sexual orientation, such as Barrett’s passe “preference,” can spark outrage and character assassination from within the LGBTQ community.

The Obergefell decision that legalized same-sex marriage expectedly loomed large in the confirmation hearings. “Only in more recent years have psychiatrists and others recognized that sexual orientation is both a normal expression of human sexuality and immutable,” Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who has since retired, wrote in the landmark 2015 case. But Kennedy actually mischaracterized the American Psychological Association’s amicus brief by suggesting that scientists have closed the case on sexual orientation.

Today, LGBTQ politics and endorsing a “born this way” narrative of sexuality seem inextricable. But widespread belief in the innateness of sexual orientation is relatively recent, and LGBTQ rights have not always been tied to biology.

The intermingling of LGBTQ rights activists and scientists is actually a nuanced history that dates back at least to 19th century advocacy against anti-sodomy laws that criminalized homosexuality in Europe. Political scientists and sociologists have noted that U.S. LGBTQ rights activists’ deployment of biological arguments about the innateness and immutability of sexual orientation actually intensified in the second half of the 20th century, particularly in efforts to ban “conversion therapy.”

My research documents how the relationship between one’s beliefs about the nature of sexual orientation and how one views sexual minorities is far more complicated than popular “born this way” discourse would lead us to believe.

Predictably, we have found beliefs about sexual orientation’s naturalness to be prevalent. In other words, lots of people we survey believe that sexual orientation is both innate and unchangeable. Unexpectedly, we have not found these beliefs to be a particularly useful predictor of the extent to which someone is homophobic. Consistently, we have observed that straight people’s beliefs about gay people being fundamentally similar to one another (and very different from straight people) are more reliable predictors of sexual prejudice. Likewise, homophobia appears more prevalent among those who believe that knowing a person’s sexual orientation tells you a lot about who someone really is. And telling people that science proves being gay is inborn also does not appear to make them less homophobic.

We even looked at how these beliefs play out in elections. In a study published earlier this month, we explored how beliefs about sexual orientation might predict voting in the 2016 presidential election. “Born this way” beliefs told us nothing about how our sample of young people intended to vote. Trump supporters and Clinton supporters both thought gay people are born that way. Instead, once again, other beliefs about sexuality, including the belief that people are either completely gay or completely straight, were much more revealing about respondents’ political affiliation and intended voting behavior. The more rigid, discrete and inflexible one viewed sexualities, the more likely people were to support then-candidate Donald Trump.

I do not know if Barrett believes I was born gay. I do know that she is consistently antiabortion, does not believe that racial epithets necessarily make a workplace hostile and has an ambivalent relationship to LGBTQ rights at best. She claimed not to discriminate against LGBTQ people in Tuesday’s hearing, but she knows the key legal issue is what precisely constitutes discrimination under the law. What Barrett views as a business’s right to religious exemption may be what I call discrimination, but it will be Barrett’s opinion that counts."
Why Amy Coney Barrett's use of the term 'sexual preference' at her hearing alarmed so many,['Harmeet Kaur'],"(CNN) Early on in Tuesday's confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill, Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett used a term that alarmed many LGBTQ+ people and advocates:

Sexual preference.

Barrett referenced the term when asked about the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges , which granted the right to same-sex marriage -- a choice of words that Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono condemned in a lengthy statement.

""Even though you didn't give a direct answer I think your response did speak volumes,"" Hirono said. ""Not once, but twice, you used the term sexual preference to describe those in the LGBTQ community. And let me make clear, sexual preference is an offensive and outdated term.""

Hirono continued, ""It is used by anti-LGBTQ activists to suggest that sexual orientation is a choice. It is not.""

She added that if Barrett believed ""that sexual orientation is merely a preference,"" then the LGBTQ community should be ""rightly concerned"" whether the judge would uphold their constitutional right to marry.

Barrett later apologized for causing offense.

""I certainly didn't mean, and would never mean, to use a term that would cause any offense in the LGBTQ community,"" she said. ""So if I did, I greatly apologize for that.""

Here's why many people found Barrett's use of the term concerning.

It suggests sexual orientation is a choice

Many LGBTQ people take issue with the term sexual preference because it implies that who a person is romantically and sexually attracted to is merely a matter of personal choice -- an idea that both advocacy organizations and health professionals have long rejected.

""The word preference suggests a degree of voluntary choice that is not necessarily reported by lesbians and gay men and that has not been demonstrated in psychological research,"" the American Psychological Association (APA) noted in a journal article published in 1991.

Instead, advocacy groups recommend that people use the term sexual orientation or simply, orientation.

""The term 'sexual preference' is typically used to suggest that being lesbian, gay or bisexual is a choice and therefore can and should be 'cured,'"" GLAAD, which lobbies for greater understanding and inclusion of LGBTQ+ people in media, notes in its media reference guide.

""Sexual orientation is the accurate description of an individual's enduring physical, romantic and/or emotional attraction to members of the same and/or opposite sex and is inclusive of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, as well as straight men and women.""

It's true that sexual preference and sexual orientation have often been used interchangeably by some in the past.

But language is constantly evolving and adapting to reflect the experiences and ideas of those it describes. Terms that might have seemed acceptable even a few years ago may not be viewed as such today.

For example, as recently as last month , Merriam-Webster included the term sexual preference under its definition of the word ""preference"" to refer to sexual orientation. The dictionary has since updated its entry to reflect the way the term is now interpreted.

""The term sexual preference as used to refer to sexual orientation is widely considered offensive in its implied suggestion that a person can choose who they are sexually or romantically attracted to,"" Merriam-Webster says.

It's used to validate harmful practices

Suggesting that sexuality is a preference can also imply that it has the potential to be changed or ""cured,"" an idea often promoted by right-wing Christian groups.

That's the thinking behind harmful practices like conversion therapy , which has been widely debunked by major medical organizations and outlawed by many state and local legislatures.

Most studies have shown that attempting to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity through therapy doesn't work , and can actually put them at a greater risk of depression, anxiety or suicide."
Opinion: President Trump's brazen attack on American democracy,['Anne Milgram'],"Anne Milgram is CNN contributor and a distinguished scholar in residence at New York University's School of Law. She served as federal prosecutor and was attorney general of New Jersey from 2007 to 2010. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) In a stunningly dishonest and brazen speech from the White House this evening, President Trump falsely claimed that a secret cabal of Democratic voters and election officials was stealing the 2020 election from him. As he spoke, former Vice President Joe Biden was steadily approaching the 270 electoral college votes he needed to be elected President.

Trump's remarks were plainly desperate, a last-ditch effort to claim that he is losing because others are cheating him. He accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" and ""rig"" the election, essentially implicating the entire Democratic Party in these imagined crimes. It was the kind of speech that, four years ago, I would not have believed any American president would make.

At its core, the President's speech was an attack on our democracy and the legal voting systems long established in every one of our states and territories. The President screaming that the polls and voting were fraudulent -- without any evidence of fraud -- was the political equivalent of someone falsely screaming ""Fire!"" in a crowded movie theater. The goal was to create confusion and undercut the outcome of the election.

Trump falsely claimed again that he could not possibly lose an honest election. ""If you count the legal votes, I win the election,"" he said. His argument was simple: votes for him are ""legal"" and the mail-in votes for Biden in battleground states (which Trump noted fall heavily in favor of Vice President Biden) are not.

Trump made these false claims without evidence. He did not mention the court cases that have been filed on his behalf based on the same false claims -- some of which have already been tossed out of court for lacking merit.

He did not explain why his own vote -- by mail, in Florida -- was not fraudulent. Nor did he explain how the ballots cast in Senate elections -- which appear on track to maintain Republican control of the Senate -- were OK, while the votes cast for president on the exact same ballot were bogus.

The President explained nothing.

He did not talk about how the battleground states counting mail-in ballots were doing exactly what they should be doing. When I served as Attorney General for New Jersey, I oversaw the state Division of Elections. Each state sets its own rules for elections: when, how and where votes are cast and counted, and what forms of voting to allow -- in person, by mail or both.

And then after the election, the states count the votes before they certify the winners. People may challenge votes or voters, if they have reason to believe that they are not legitimate. But a vote cannot be challenged simple because of the form it takes -- sent by mail, for example -- or because of the political candidate it is cast for.

The President didn't talk about any of those things. He wanted to talk about a senseless theory about a national conspiracy coordinated on a vast scale by election officials and voters from Pennsylvania to Arizona to North Carolina to Georgia and beyond. The President has made variations of this argument for months, with no evidence to back it up.

What we have seen in evidence this week was something far larger and more beautiful than the evil scheme the President imagined. It was thousands and thousands of elections officials and workers, and the American people, joining together to reach a common goal -- for citizens to exercise their democratic right and duty to vote, in the middle of a pandemic, in a battered economy, with many waiting in line for hours on end.

It was a conspiracy -- a conspiracy of democracy, whose goal was a fair and free election. To allow the people of the United States -- regardless of their political party, or favorite candidate, or way that they voted -- to stand up to be heard, and to have their say in how their government is run. Some state officials are Democrats, as are millions of voters. Some officials -- and millions of voters -- are Republicans. Many are neither. But at the end of the day, all are Americans.

Their votes must be counted."

(CNN) We are all Tom Petty now.

The legendary rocker knew ""the waiting is the hardest part."" But why are we waiting? In the case of Pennsylvania, the most populous of the states whose counts we are hanging on, the delay is a feature, not a bug. The sand in the gears was placed there by Republicans who control the state legislature.

Earlier this fall, it became evident that Covid-19 would drive Pennsylvanians to vote by mail in record numbers. The GOP-controlled State House passed a measure to allow counties to begin processing mail-in ballots three days before the election. So far, so good. They saw the problem coming, and they came up with a solution.

But they could not resist attaching partisan poison pills to the legislation, like outlawing satellite drop boxes and allowing poll watchers to operate outside their own county. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf threatened to veto the measure, and it ultimately died.

However, the problem of clerks being unable to begin processing mail-in ballots before Election Day remained. The solution, called ""pre-canvassing,"" is to simply allow clerks to begin processing mail-in ballots as they arrive. No poison pills. No ban on drop boxes. And no allowing poll watchers to drive across the state to potentially intimidate voters in a county they're not familiar with.

She is also an adjunct professor at Fordham University. The views expressed here are hers. Read more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) While the presidential candidates spent November 2 making their final stops on the campaign trail, I glanced at my calendar between assignments and realized it was my seven-month anniversary of living with long-term Covid-19 . (In case you're wondering, the traditional gift for this milestone is a heating pad.)

There are more than two outcomes following a Covid-19 diagnosis. In addition to dying from the virus or recovering completely, tens of thousands of us form another category completely: those with symptoms that stick around for several months (at least), potentially resulting in permanent physical and/or neurological damage, some type of chronic condition, or both. It's too early to know for sure

Each long-termer, including myself, has their own unique set of symptoms that appear in various combinations. For instance, mine include, but are not limited to: a constant accelerated heart rate, loss of depth perception, a variety of gastrointestinal issues (I'll spare you the details), hair loss, brain fog, extreme fatigue that never goes away, an impressive assortment of skin rashes, nighttime hallucinations and joint pain.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump's own experience with Covid-19 , by his account, appears to have gone more smoothly than humanly possible. Before leaving Walter Reed Medical Center after only 72 hours of treatment, he tweeted that he felt better than he did 20 years ago, then returned to the White House for his grand finale: triumphantly whipping off his face mask from the balcony, channeling both Eva Peron and P.T. Barnum.

In the same October 5 tweet, Trump also told his followers not to be afraid of Covid-19, or ""let it dominate your life."" As someone whose life has been dominated by this virus for more than half of 2020, I found his message not only ignorant and inaccurate, but also harmful. At a point when basic public health measures, like wearing face masks, were already politicized (with Trump's followers overwhelmingly against them), the last thing we needed was messaging from the President asserting falsely that the novel coronavirus, which has now claimed the lives of more than 234,000 people in the United States, was not a serious threat.

Still, in what turned out to be nothing more than wishful thinking, I held out (a tiny bit of) hope when it came to the election; specifically, that people would take the magnitude of the pandemic into account before casting their ballot for someone who has repeatedly demonstrated that he doesn't have the capacity to understand it, let alone the capability to handle it. The alternative would have been acknowledging that, for a significant number of Americans, the lives of those with Covid-19 -- a disproportionate number of whom are people of color -- lack value in comparison with their own. Even for a pessimist, that's pretty dark.

As I watched the election results trickle in Tuesday night and the counting continue through the week, it became evident that no matter who wins, public health has suffered a major loss. The close race indicates that a substantial number of voters opted to support someone whose dangerous messaging on Covid-19 will only make the pandemic worse -- never mind making any progress in slowing its spread. And that's in addition to the votes of confidence for someone who responded to demonstrations for racial justice with words and policies that further entrenched the systemic racism activists and communities of color have spent this year (and centuries before it) working to dismantle.

Of course, that's not to say that everyone who voted for Trump lacks either the most basic understanding of public health, the willingness to cooperate with preventative measures, or both. But it does lead me to believe that ensuring that as many people as possible make it through the pandemic alive isn't necessarily their priority. (That would be the economy, according to the results of a nationwide CNN exit poll .)

The same CNN exit poll data reinforces the partisan split over the coronavirus, indicating that while more than four in five people who voted for former Vice President Joe Biden said that efforts to contain the pandemic are going badly, only one in 10 Trump supporters felt the same way. Additionally, only half of Trump supporters said that they view wearing a face mask as a public health responsibility more than as a personal choice (compared to more than four in five Biden voters).

On the one hand, it's reassuring to hear that half of Trump supporters do understand the reasoning behind wearing face masks during a pandemic. But on the other hand, just based on the over 68 million votes Trump had at the time of writing, that's potentially more than 34 million people who don't -- a number high enough that it likely includes people who were impacted by Covid-19 themselves.

Those public officials charged with promoting and maintaining public health must not let the election or its aftermath deter them from the hard truth that those 34 million -- and others who are suffering from understandable Covid-19 fatigue -- are where they must place their focus in the weeks and months to come. A staggeringly difficult road lies ahead, and it's imperative that we prioritize scientifically accurate messaging and emphasize the necessity for Americans to look out for each other.

Given the extent of public buy-in required for public health interventions -- like masking and social distancing -- to work, we need far more people to actively participate if we hope to slow the spread of the virus. Holding out on wearing a mask under the assumption that a safe and effective vaccine will soon be readily available is not a strategy; it's reckless and puts lives at risk.

At the same time, this perspective does make sense in the context of traditional American cultural values. The whitewashed narrative of the country's history so many of us are taught in school stresses the importance of our individual liberties and freedoms, but the lesson in rights and values too often seems to end there, leaving people to assume that they always and automatically override everything else.

But public health is different. It challenges that notion by asking people to temporarily limit some aspects of their personal autonomy in favor of the health of the wider population. For some, this is a major shift in mindset, and not one that happens overnight (or, evidently, in eight months).

That's what makes reliable, accurate public health messaging, which Trump is clearly unwilling to embrace, a matter of life and death right now. With new cases rising in multiple regions, high rates of asymptomatic spread and all available indicators on the pandemic pointing in a grim direction as we head toward winter, disseminating a message about how to counter the spread -- and getting Americans to heed it for themselves and for others -- should be our country's top priority.

No matter who is inaugurated in January 2021, the fact remains that there are still tens of millions of people who voted for a candidate who is himself a threat to public health. Whether or not you've personally dealt with the virus and its aftermath, that is terrifying. And that's on top of the current forecast for a particularly bleak winter, with at least three more months of Trump presiding over the pandemic. With Covid-19 cases continuing to increase across the country and flu season already underway, this does not bode well for any of us."
Life as a Covid-19 Long-Termer,"['Elizabeth Yuko', ""Elizabeth Yuko'S Most Recent Stories"", 'Can Herd Immunity Save Us', 'Life As A Long-Termer', 'Meet The People We Re Counting On For A Vaccine', 'View All']","On a damp and unseasonably cool late-March day in Southern California, Nicole Batenhorst looked around the triage tent and realized that getting a folding metal chair made her one of the lucky ones. She had just arrived at her local hospital in an ambulance after her heartbeat had become dangerously erratic, and was still wearing pajamas. The emergency room was full, so she was ushered into a triage tent set up outside, bursting with overflow patients desperate to get help and stay dry in a place with no available beds or blankets.

After about a half hour in the tent, she was given a bed inside when her heart rate dropped to 36 beats per minute. A doctor came to check on her, and almost immediately started crying. He told Batenhorst that he had to send her home because there were other patients who needed the bed more. “That was terrifying — seeing a male, middle-aged ER doctor cry like that,” says Batenhorst. “He also said that three people had died just since his shift started that morning. It was 10 a.m.”

Despite having all the usual Covid symptoms since February — and being immunocompromised and therefore considered high-risk — Batenhorst wasn’t able to get tested or receive treatment in the hospital in March. Because the tests were in such short supply, she says that the ER doctor told her he wasn’t authorized to give her one, but that he had no doubt she had Covid based on her symptoms, exam, and what he referred to as “weird spots” on her lungs that were visible in X-rays.

Now, seven months after her hospital visit and eight months after her symptoms began, Batenhorst is still debilitatingly ill. In this time, she has experienced shortness of breath, dizziness, intense headaches, severe gastrointestinal issues (causing her to lose a significant amount of weight), a consistent fever, extreme fatigue, brain fog, chest pain, arrhythmia, joint inflammation, and organ failure, among other complications. Batenhorst hasn’t left her home since her trip to the hospital in March, and hasn’t gotten an antibody test. But for a variety of reasons — including the test’s high rates of false negatives and the fact that it’s still unclear how long antibodies last after infection — the results wouldn’t necessarily clear things up.

And then there’s the toll that long-term Covid has had on her mental health. “I have been gaslighted by so many people, including several of the doctors that I tried to get to take my case,” Batenhorst explains. “Hearing ‘there’s nothing I can do for you’ repeatedly has been heartbreaking.” She has lost friends and has had to cut family members out of her life because they don’t believe she’s sick. The financial strain of being ill for so long has also been a major source of mental distress, ranging from not being able to afford basic necessities like toilet paper and food, to facing imminent homelessness. “It’s been a hell of a ride,” Batenhorst tells Rolling Stone.

The president’s recent bout with Covid-19 — coupled with his messaging around the virus — isn’t helping. On October 5th, I read his tweet announcing that he was going to leave Walter Reed Medical Center that evening, and immediately started sobbing. Not because I expected more from him (I do not) or because I was in disbelief over his suspiciously short recovery timeline, but specifically because of the lines: “Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life,” followed by his claim that he feels better than he did 20 years ago. Not only was this a slap in the face to the families and friends of the 218,000 people who have died from the virus, but a major blow to those with long-term Covid whose lives have been dominated by the condition — including myself.

Like Batenhorst, I’m one of the at least tens of thousands of people who have been experiencing Covid symptoms for months, with no end in sight. What began on April 2nd as three-and-a-half weeks of intense chest pain and burning, along with shortness of breath, has morphed into six months of extreme fatigue, debilitating headaches and body aches, a rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis, basically every gastrointestinal issue you can think of, and neurological symptoms like serious brain fog and loss of depth perception.

As someone who came into the pandemic being treated for depression, anxiety, and PTSD, I knew things were about to get worse — but I never expected it to this extent. The past few weeks in particular have been incredibly challenging. At this point, we’re used to people not believing that we’re still sick, and know that being invalidated on a national level by the president of the United States will make our lives even more difficult.

If anything, the varied and sometimes unusual physical and neurological effects of the virus deserve — and require — more attention and research. And the impact of long-term Covid symptoms is taking its toll on our bodies, and brains; it has been catastrophic to our mental health. Between coming to terms with our new limitations, dealing with the rollercoaster of symptoms that wax and wane, the uncertainty of not knowing when (or if) we’ll start to feel better, and constantly having to defend and advocate for ourselves — even to well-meaning friends and family members — it’s hard not to feel completely hopeless.

What is long-term Covid-19?

For Tammy Edwards and her husband Brian Edwards of Tacoma, Washington, the past six months have been a nightmare. Both have been dealing with Covid symptoms since April — including 11 days Brian spent on a ventilator — and it has taken a major toll on not only their physical health, but their mental health as well. “Not a day goes by where we don’t worry about the long-term effects this virus has taken on our bodies,” Tammy tells Rolling Stone. “I would like people to know that long-haulers are not exaggerating about their lingering and ever-changing symptoms. What we feel each week is bizarre and we are scared.”

At this point, it’s too early to know the full trajectory of a Covid-19 diagnosis, and in turn, the “normal” length of the illness. For this reason, several of the doctors interviewed for this article were hesitant to refer to what so many of us are experiencing now as “long-term” cases or symptoms of COVID-19. While that’s fair, it’s not an excuse to overlook those who are now several months in, just because we don’t have the data to firmly establish a recovery timeline. Whether or not we’ll be considered Covid “long-termers” or “long-haulers” moving forward — once we have the benefits of hindsight and more information — remains to be seen. So far, findings from two published studies indicate that between 50% and 90% of people with Covid continue to have symptoms of the viral infection three months after first getting sick, even after they’ve tested negative. And while it’s great that research specifically on long-termers is currently underway — which is itself a crucial step — we’re (still) sick now.

Because we’ve been told repeatedly that the novel coronavirus typically works its way through the body over the course of two weeks (hence 14-day quarantines), those of us who have been sick longer than that have faced constant questions and disbelief. But as it turns out, there is strong medical precedent of viral illnesses that continue to activate the immune system, even long after the virus is gone. “Some people have had persistence in fatigue, brain fog, and malaise [following a viral illness] — and that’s been recognized for years,” says Dr. Keith Armitage, medical director of the Roe Green Center for Travel Medicine & Global Health at University Hospitals in Cleveland. For now, we’re still figuring out whether this will be the case for Covid-19.

The mental health impact of long-term Covid

Back in March, when EMTs arrived at her house to bring her to the ER, Batenhorst says that a fireman took one look at her pale, exhausted face and declared, “Oh god, here’s another one,” before asking if she had a history of anxiety or depression. By this point, her neighbors started coming out of their houses to catch a glimpse of the action, and Batenhorst says that she told the fireman that it was none of his business. After demanding that she answer the questions, Batenhorst told him that she was diagnosed with minor anxiety following a period of severe health complications — at which point the fireman threw his hands up in the air in frustration and disbelief. It was only after the ambulance driver intervened, took her vitals, and insisted that she was legitimately sick that she had the privilege of being brought to the hospital

This is another common experience among people — including myself — who have sought medical help after living with long-term Covid for months: being told that all of our physical, mental, and neurological symptoms are simply manifestations of our anxiety or depression. If, like Batenhorst and me, a long-termer has previous mental health diagnoses, it makes it even easier for the doctor to completely disregard our concerns. Part of the reason for that, according to Dr. Laura K. Murray, a clinical psychologist and senior scientist at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health, is that fatigue, decreased energy, and trouble concentrating — three conditions closely associated with long-term Covid — are all assessed in mental health screenings for conditions like anxiety and depression.

In 20 years of practicing as an infectious disease specialist, Armitage says that people who have had long-term health consequences resulting from viral infections often see an impact on their mental health, including feelings of frustration and frequently, depression. This can be particularly distressing, he explains, for people whose family members and friends don’t believe they’re actually sick. “The most important thing for me when treating patients who have persistent symptoms of a viral illness, is to acknowledge them and say ‘it’s not in your head,’” Armitage says, noting that he makes a point of validating his patients’ concerns and frustrations.

Then there’s also the frustration and disappointment that comes when a medical professional either dismisses your concerns completely, or simply isn’t able to help. “It has been difficult when your doctors don’t know what to test you for, so that they can properly treat you,” Tammy says. Batenhorst has faced similar challenges with doctors. “They’ll gladly charge you for a video appointment, but are they going to give you anything beyond a Z-Pak? No,” she explains, based on her own experience. “It’s like, ‘No, I don’t want your Z-Pak, I don’t have a bacterial infection.’”

Of course, for people who have lived for years with chronic illnesses, none of this is new — especially if the conditions are “invisible,” meaning that there aren’t obvious visual clues that a person is sick or living with a disability. Having any chronic illness can impact your mental health, Murray says, and while the duration of long-term Covid is still unknown (and partially because of that), it’s not uncommon for people to experience symptoms of depression. “The signs of depression — feeling discouraged or sad or hopeless — to a certain degree, is normal, and that’s really important to recognize,” she tells Rolling Stone. “If it goes into the extreme — you’re finding yourself in bed a lot, or wanting to eat all the time or never eat, or once it starts getting into a multitude of problems and symptoms and it’s happening for longer time periods — then we’ll look into depression.”

The mental burden of self-advocacy

For Tammy and Brian Edwards, the hardest part about being Covid long-termers is trying to get people to understand and validate how both physically and mentally miserable they feel. “Just because many people have mild cases and are back to work in a few weeks, it doesn’t mean that there aren’t tens of thousands like us, suffering long-term symptoms and oftentimes are disregarded,” Tammy says.

For decades, people living with chronic illness have put in innumerable hours of unpaid labor trying to educate and even simply convince the rest of us that they’re unwell and deserve certain accommodations and more research on their conditions. It’s a little different for Covid long-termers (many of whom also have existing chronic illnesses). While most people do acknowledge that Covid-19 exists and is potentially life-threatening, we’re still at the point where many believe that there are only two possible outcomes following the illness: fully recovering within a few weeks, or dying after a hospital stay involving a ventilator. It makes people uncomfortable and unsettled to find out that not everyone with Covid neatly fits into this rigid narrative. That leaves the onus on the thousands of us who don’t fit into either category to prove that we exist.

And, as Murray points out, as humans, we want other people to believe us — especially in situations like long-term Covid, where this type of disbelief acts as yet another stressor. “It gets rather personal, I think, especially if you feel like people are insinuating you did something wrong, or you are doing something wrong now to not get over it,” she explains. On top of that, Murray says that many long-termers are finding that while their friends and family may have been initially supportive during the acute phase of their illness, as the months wore on, some became significantly less understanding.

People’s disbelief comes at different levels, ranging from accusing you of making the whole thing up, to understanding that you’re sick, but then attempting to pinpoint exactly where you went wrong to end up like this. Often, the cross-examination is subtle, coming from friends and family members who genuinely want to help you, but are at a loss as to how to do that. The concern — which again, is usually coming from a good place — frequently takes the form of a barrage of questions, including but not limited to:

Did you actually test positive for the virus? What about antibodies? How do you know that you really had it and it wasn’t just a cold or the flu? [Followed by a description of that time they had a bad flu and felt horrible.] Did you even have to go to the hospital? How did you manage to get it? Were you wearing a face mask and practicing social distancing? Have you tried hydroxychloroquine, or that other new treatment I just saw on the news — you know, the one with the study? What about [insert any number of unproven natural remedies, mythical cures, or flat-out scams]? You know, our bodies react to stress in many different ways — couldn’t this just be stress or your usual anxiety?

Though we appreciate your interest in our health, the most compassionate thing you can do is believe us.

Mild cases become strange symptoms

Perhaps part of the reason it can be so difficult for people to wrap their heads around the existence of long-term symptoms, is that so many of us “only” had a mild case of Covid-19 that either didn’t require hospitalization, or didn’t qualify us for a bed in places where there was a shortage. We expect people who were put on ventilators to face long-term effects of the virus, including breathing problems, weakness, and cognitive challenges like brain fog. But for the rest of us, the assumption is that once we hit that two-week mark, we’ve recovered entirely. Not to mention that for many of us who got sick early this spring don’t have positive test results to “prove” we really had the virus because we didn’t meet the stringent testing requirements in place at the time. But doctors who have been treating long-term Covid patients, including Armitage, have noticed that most had “moderately severe cases,” with symptoms like fever, cough, and shortness of breath, but never getting to the point of requiring a ventilator or other forms of mechanically assisted breathing.

It doesn’t help that a lot of long-term Covid symptoms are really weird. Sure, there’s the expected fatigue, shortness of breath, and persistent body aches, and as debilitating as these are, it’s just the starting point. And though we’re now at the stage where we’ve accepted loss of taste and smell — and even Covid toes — as both short- and long-term symptoms of the virus, the growing list of lingering effects is far more expansive. Drawing only from my interviews with other long-termers, a small sample of these more unusual symptoms include: hair loss, degenerating eyesight, changes in menstrual cycle, changes in earwax production, tinnitus, emitting a strong sulphuric odor, having graphic nightmares then waking up with unexplained bruises, a wide variety of skin rashes, sudden loss of voice, permanently blood-shot eyes, hot flashes, shivering that morphs into uncontrollable tremors, confusion, a metallic taste in the mouth, constantly smelling cigarette smoke, loss of depth perception, muscle spasms, increased sensitivity to the sun, and pain that feels like electricity somehow got trapped inside your limbs.

And there are so many more. For this reason, many long-termers have turned to support groups on Facebook and Slack to compare notes on their strangest symptoms and experiences in recovery limbo, and engage with people who are living through the same thing. Having a space to learn more about long-term Covid that doesn’t require having to convince others that you’re actually sick, has for many, including myself, been incredibly helpful for our mental health. The relief and validation that comes from a stranger saying that they’ve been having the same oddly specific type of diarrhea cannot be overstated.

Alexandrea Rakowski, who has had Covid symptoms since mid-April, is a member of the Survivor Corps Facebook group, which currently has 110,000 members. “This group has changed my life — it showed me I was not alone,” she tells Rolling Stone. “There is a huge lack of empathy towards those who have lost their lives and those who survived this virus. This group allows us to be there for each other, while understanding on the deepest level possible.” And it’s not just moral support: Rakowski says that the group has encouraged her to reach out to her doctors about things she previously thought were unrelated, but actually turned out to be very closely related to complications of the virus. “I have no idea what I would do without Survivor Corps,” she adds. Similarly, Pam Bryce, another Covid long-termer, has used resources from the group to find doctors who take her seriously. “Before I joined, I had given up hope,” she tells Rolling Stone. “I had accepted that this virus will kill me.” Since joining, in addition to accessing information about symptoms, Bryce has also completed surveys that are part of research conducted by universities and doctors who are trying to get a better grasp on the condition.

A loss of identity

For many of us, these physiological and neurological effects have put new limitations on our bodies and brains — some of which jeopardize our very identities. For instance, professional athletes who had Covid may end up with long-term conditions — like inflammation of the heart muscle — that could end their careers. And as Murray explains, people facing new physical limitations thanks to Covid also have to contend with what that does to their mental health. “For example, I know some folks that used to be quite active, and they may not be having severe symptoms, but they’re still not able to go back to their [pre-Covid] activity level, which can be very frustrating,” she says. “Over time, this can obviously affect a lot of different things, especially if that was something that you did to help your mood.”

As someone who earns a living writing and teaching at the university level, I derive much of my identity from my work (with the understanding and acknowledgement that this isn’t necessarily the healthiest mindset). The past six months of neurological challenges like incessant brain fog, combined with the onset of mild symptoms of dyslexia (something I had never previously experienced) have made it far more difficult and time-consuming to get my work done. In turn, this has triggered periods of intense depression and anxiety. In a way, it’s a form of grief, as we mourn the loss of our pre-Covid selves.

In her pre-Covid life, Batenhorst — who has bachelor’s and master’s degrees in applied mathematics — worked as a data analyst for companies like Intel and Portland General Electric, and taught math at several different universities. Now, her ongoing brain fog has made even everyday tasks challenging. For example, one day Batenhorst got up to get a glass of water, then promptly forgot what she was doing. “I stood there, and I just started crying because I couldn’t remember what I was about to do,” she explains. “And I’m having those senioritis brain-fart moments, constantly. And there’s some days that are way worse than others. My short term [memory] is gone.”

This loss of identity is something I witnessed several years ago as I was caring for my mother following her traumatic brain injury (TBI). As a former reference librarian, she was used to being able to recall facts, dates, and other information instantly. Post-TBI, the knowledge was all still there, but it was far less accessible, making her feel as though she was no longer “herself,” and was the biggest source of her depression. While I had empathy for what she was going through, I didn’t truly understand what it felt like until I had Covid: Everything I knew before I got sick is still with me, but now I have to work much harder to access it. According to Dr. John Krakauer, a neurologist at Johns Hopkins University and director of their Center for the Study of Motor Learning and Brain Repair, there are similarities between cognitive long-term Covid symptoms, and those associated with TBI. “TBI patients also end up having loads of complaints over the years — depression, anxiety, dizziness, failure to concentrate, headaches — lots of subjective complaints that can go on for long periods of time,” he tells Rolling Stone. “And I think that the post-Covid patients — especially the ones with neurological symptoms and body weakness — are very similar, and should be thought about in the same kind of way.”

A new condition needs a new approach

After several months treating Covid patients, endocrinologist Dr. Zijian Chen, and his colleagues at Mount Sinai in New York City, noticed that many continued to have residual effects that didn’t go away. “Having this information, the health system decided that it’s time that we start looking at this disease as something that’s long-term — something that’s chronic — and start treating this group of patients with a focus on making sure that they get all the specialty care that they need in order to overcome all the symptoms,” Chen tells Rolling Stone. This includes treating their mental health.

And beyond acknowledging that someone with long-term Covid could develop anxiety, depression, or other mental health conditions, the newly created Center for Post-Covid Care at Mount Sinai tailors their services to meet the specific needs of this patient group. According to Chen, who is the center’s director, this approach was modeled on the center the hospital created following the September 11th terrorist attacks. “When you look at the World Trade Center, that unfortunate event created a subset of patients that have a very specific group of symptoms,” he explains. “Covid is very much like that, except much bigger, with many more patients.”

For example, after 9/11, Chen says that there were a lot of people who developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or increased anxiety that they didn’t have before the event. Now, something similar is happening with long-term Covid patients. “Just imagine someone who is ill — who got very sick, very quickly, through really no fault of their own — and still has symptoms that they don’t know what to do with, and are now stuck at home and can’t go to work, or maybe lost their job,” Chen says. “All these things together are very stressful and can have a negative impact on your psyche.”

As a mental health professional, Dr. Karen Kline, a marriage and family therapist — as well as a Covid long-termer — can attest to the impact of the condition on our mental health. “On day five of my fever I wrote my will, believing I was nearing the end, and the ‘Covid depression’ hit,” she tells Rolling Stone. “I was isolated from my family, couldn’t be there for my clients, couldn’t be there to help take care of my dad, and I felt terrible.” During the acute phase of her illness, Kline says that she struggled with anxiety attacks, including ones so severe they would wake her up in the middle of the night. In the months since, it’s still there. “There is residual anxiety about what could be next as a result of this illness and whether or not I could get this again,” she says.

As we learn more, it’s getting better

Pleading our case has been slightly easier now that medical professionals at establishments like the Mayo Clinic and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have acknowledged that Covid-19 can result in prolonged illness, even among otherwise healthy young adults. We’re also getting some (admittedly very) preliminary information on exactly how many people with Covid go on to experience long-term effects. This includes a recent survey conducted by the Lung Foundation and CIRO (a treatment and research center for chronic illnesses) in the Netherlands, which found that 87% of 457 participants (who had all tested positive for Covid-19, and who were all members of online social-support groups for long-term Covid) reported persistent extreme fatigue, and nearly three-quarters continued to have shortness of breath — both lasting for months. And of the 85% of participants who considered themselves “healthy” before getting Covid, only 6% could say the same three months following their diagnosis. And this is only the beginning: it will take years — even decades — of research to understand the full picture.

At the same time, the speed at which physicians and researchers are learning more about the novel coronavirus is a source of hope. For example, in the early months of the pandemic, Covid-19 was identified and treated as a respiratory illness. “And what we’ve learned is that part of that’s true: it does target the respiratory tract as the first site of infection,” Armitage explains. “But the virus can attack the cells of the vascular system. The receptor that the virus attaches itself to can be found in abundance in the lining of blood vessels.” This understanding of Covid-19 as a vascular disease that can impact every part of your body has already resulted in some treatment developments. “Assessing for the blood clotting status and putting people on certain types of blood thinners is now a foundational part of the management of the sicker patients,” Armitage says, noting that clotting is likely responsible for symptoms like COVID toes. This is a particularly important development given that nearly one-fourth of people hospitalized for Covid-19 have been diagnosed with cardiovascular complications, and two recent studies indicate that post-Covid heart damage is likely more widespread than was initially thought.

Along the same lines, some physicians, like Dr. Abe Malkin, founder and medical director of Concierge MD LA, have shifted their perception of Covid from a brief viral infection, to a condition that can result in long-term physical or neurological effects. For example, Malkin sees Covid as having more in common with conditions like mononucleosis (caused by Epstein-Barr virus) and Lyme disease (caused by bacteria) than the flu. “That’s not to say that Covid is going to be a lifelong infection for everyone,” he says, “but I’ve started to think of it in terms of how I’d treat mono or Lyme disease: about how to manage the inflammation — not just the symptoms, but the underlying conditions, too.”

In the meantime, if you’re not a medical professional or researcher and are wondering how you can help, it’s actually pretty simple: believe us. “Please be patient with those that continue to deal with the viral after-effects,” Tammy says. “We don’t want this. We, too, want answers. We want help and we want to be ourselves again. It’s sobering to think that we may never be the same again.”

Ideally, this greater understanding of Covid-19 will bring with it increasingly effective ways to prevent and treat the viral infection. Of course, the onset of any long-term condition has the potential to bring depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions along for the ride. But if we’re able to get to the point where we no longer have to convince people that we’re sick — through no fault or negligence of our own — it’ll be a massive weight lifted off of our sore, slumping shoulders.

Pennsylvania AG: 100% of legal ballots will be counted (Opinion),['Opinion Josh Shapiro'],"Josh Shapiro is the attorney general of Pennsylvania. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) More than 140 million people across this nation cast a ballot to make their voice heard. We owe this historic turnout, and the remarkably smooth Election Day, to the hard work of public servants in communities across the country -- running polling sites and counting ballots.

Even so, when I woke up the next morning, my kids asked the same question we all had: Dad, who won? What happened in the election?

I know that the answer, ""We just have to be patient,"" will be about as satisfying to millions of Americans as it was to my kids. But that's the law, it's the truth, and it's the only way to make sure that legal votes determine the winner of our election.

This process was helped by local officials and clerks who have been committed to making sure that every voter could vote safely. Voters can have confidence that if they followed the law, their vote will be counted -- and no matter who wins, that the final vote count will be legitimate.

This is a commitment made in every state, in every county, in every city and town across America: in states that lean Democrat and in states that lean Republican, on the West Coast and the East Coast, from Hawaii to the heartland. That's our American tradition, and that is our law.

Election workers count ballots on November 3 in Philadelphia.

Over the next few days, we'll see that our process is followed in Pennsylvania, we will see totals add up until 100% of the ballots are in, winners will be determined and the will of the voters will be heard.

Pennsylvania is committed to following the law and making sure that the count is accurate. We owe that to our neighbors, to everyone who voted, and to the local public servants in our communities who are counting the votes. US elections are run by counties, and the laws they follow are set by each state . That's a fact of our federal system of government: each state runs their election differently -- and that's OK. In Pennsylvania, we'd rather take another day to get it right.

So, stay calm. Take a deep breath. Your social media feeds don't actually know what's going to happen. We don't need punditry and second-by-second analysis. Give our communities' public servants time to accurately count the votes.

As the attorney general for Pennsylvania, my job is to enforce the laws of the commonwealth. My office does not count the votes; we protect that process. We will not stand for baseless attacks on our election system and we are fully prepared to defend our laws.

The will of the voters must be heard -- and the only way to know their will is to count every legal vote.

It's possible -- and perhaps likely, that this election results in a divided government. What's clear to me is that the continued escalation of partisan rhetoric does not serve, nor does it represent, the interests, needs and will of the people. Americans showed up, voted peacefully, and are trusting the process.

As an elected official myself, I believe our leaders must always speak with moral clarity -- but especially in the coming weeks. We should reflect on the example set by Americans who, in the most heated election in recent memory, peacefully went to the polls, voted and upheld the process. Let's live up to that example, follow the law and the process, and count every legal vote.

This is a large country, with an incredible diversity of beliefs and experiences -- and election laws. Pennsylvania is the birthplace of the nation, where the first words of the Declaration of Independence were drafted, where our Constitution was framed, where soldiers in Gettysburg gave their last full measure of devotion for the cause of freedom. Our commonwealth will live up to its history: we will continue to abide our state election laws in counting the votes from this election, and we will do all we can to protect the right to vote shared by every citizen.

My commitment to you is this: we will take the time to get an accurate count of every legal vote, and at the end of the process, no matter the result, the people's voice will decide where our country goes, together."

(CNN) Anyone with a healthy skepticism of polling -- and there's been plenty to draw skepticism -- should have rejected the notion that the election would be a landslide.

Polling is harder today than it has ever been. Respondents are harder to come by, as more and more Americans abandon landlines and screen calls on their cell phones.

Democrats and many in the media assumed, wrongly, that a message of "" Orange Man Bad "" would result in a landslide. All they had to do was repeat anti-Trump rhetoric over and over -- and surely voters would agree. But issues matter. Talk from Democrats of packing the court , the Green New Deal, various proposals on universal healthcare, not to mention violence surrounding protests, likely scared people who voted for Trump in 2016, in part because they didn't like Hillary Clinton, to vote for him again in 2020.

Former Vice President Joe Biden understood this fear, as seen in his evasive non-answers on packing the court. He ultimately said he did not like the idea but would appoint a commission to study it -- Washington speak for ""that's not going to happen.""

Most people don't speak ""Washington,"" though, and the Democrats' message was often defined by its more extreme members who get all the publicity they want through debate questions and coverage in conservative media. Soft Trump voters likely saw court packing as a real possibility.

Another possible reason for Trump's unexpected showing: Despite Democratic talk of leaving it all on the field, including from Joe Biden himself (and to be clear, an election is a grueling process -- both teams worked their hearts out and have much to be proud of), the Biden campaign's field canvassing operation was not as thorough as Trump's. The Biden campaign did not knock on doors until late in the campaign.

There was a good reason for not doing this -- namely, Covid-19 -- but the Trump campaign did go door-to-door throughout the campaign. This had to have an impact on voter turnout in key states like North Carolina or Texas , or in keeping races in Arizona, Michigan or Wisconsin that much closer. This caused consternation with liberal groups and down-ballot Democrats who wanted a more robust get-out-the-vote operation.

Similarly, while the Biden campaign skillfully deployed surrogates to raise money for the campaign or state parties, it's most prominent surrogate, Barack Obama, only appeared at a few events. He even skipped North Carolina, where in 2008 he was the first Democrat to carry the state since 1976. At events, Obama's speeches were more about torching Donald Trump, who has dismantled many of his policies, rather than boosting Biden, who could restore them. And what about Michelle Obama, perhaps the most popular Democrat in the country, and whose Democratic National Convention speech was easily the most talked about? Her time on the campaign trail was limited to tweets and videos. The kind of live events, even socially distanced, that drive important local and national media just didn't happen. This makes no sense.

Undecided voters? A recent ABC/Washington Post poll in North Carolina showed Biden leading the race by a mere one point, 49-48%, with only 3% of voters undecided. In mid-October, a reporter called me asking if I could connect them to any North Carolina undecided voters. I said I didn't know any but that I would ask some friends. I asked three friends in three different North Carolina cities if they knew any undecided voters. All three laughed at the suggestions. This election was all about base motivation -- undecided voters simply didn't exist.

As a North Carolinian who has worked three Senate races in my home state, I was often asked to predict the outcome. Despite studying North Carolina's political environment closely, I simply could not make a firm prediction, other than that it would be a razor thin margin.

Over the past few years there has been a lot of talk about whether we were in the midst of a political realignment , as seen through Trump's 2016 victory. Did those who presumed an electoral blowout think our political landscape suddenly changed, again, because of the ""Orange Man Bad"" argument? If so, that makes explaining Trump's inroads with Hispanic voters in Miami-Dade County in Florida and Texas' Starr County very hard to do.

The reality is we were, and remain, a politically divided country. That doesn't look to change anytime soon. Which means the best prediction we can make today about 2024 -- are we doing that already? -- is that it won't be a landslide."
How South Africa is viewing Trump vs. Biden (opinion),['Opinion William Saunderson-Meyer'],"William Saunderson-Meyer is a South African newspaper columnist. Follow him on Twitter @TheJaundicedEye . The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) South Africans are painfully aware that their country generally does not loom large, if at all, in the awareness of most Americans, nor in the policies of their government. But that doesn't mean they're not waiting with keen interest to see the outcome of Tuesday's race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.

US involvement in South Africa peaked during the Cold War. It has revived only recently , and sporadically at that, largely as a counter to Washington's unease over the growing influence of China, with that nation's ostensibly ""no strings attached"" economic assistance to Africa through its "" belt and road "" initiative.

For historical reasons, South Africa's relationship with the US is a little different than other African nations. During the apartheid years, the White minority governments aligned themselves with the Western nations and leveraged SA's militarily strategic position to maximize British and US support. This support, articulated by President Ronald Reagan as ""constructive engagement,"" alienated the oppressed Black majority and left a lingering bad taste with many in Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, which has been the ruling party since South Africa's first democratic election in 1994.

Trump's outspokenness regularly ruffles feathers. There was anger when he tagged all of Africa, along with Haiti, as "" shithole"" countries, causing an affronted South African administration to summon the US chargé d'affaires for a dressing down.

That it was a mere chargé d'affaires in the hot seat probably added to the slight. Trump took more than two years to replace President Barack Obama's highly regarded ambassador , and the eventual appointment was of a diplomatic neophyte, a Florida socialite and handbag designer whose apparent qualification for the job was being been born in South Africa.

In a similar vein, and somewhat outrageously given that South Africa has its own problems with law enforcement's use of excessive force, President Cyril Ramaphosa's government seized on the #BlackLivesMatter protests to lament George Floyd's ""regrettable death"" and condescendingly observed that the incident ""[presented] the USA with an opportunity to address fundamental issues of human rights.""

Venezuela, Many of the ANC's radical positions are rooted in socialist solidarity with the countries that backed it militarily during its revolutionary exile during the apartheid years -- the likes of Cuba, China and Russia. The government's views tend to be at odds with those of President Donald Trump's administration over Zimbabwe Iran , the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and the seemingly intractable issue of Palestinian statehood , of which Ramaphosa's government is a vocal supporter.

Whatever its antipathies, the Ramaphosa government has been scrupulous about not commenting publicly on the US elections. Privately, it has a preference for Biden, with a government analyst telling me that South Africa believes the Democratic candidate would return to the multilateralism that Trump has scorned and is expected to be less protectionist and isolationist when it comes to China. (While most South Africans have a positive view of China's investment in Africa, a Pew study found they expect the US to be more reliable ally than China in the future. The same study found that 42% of South Africans said last year that they had confidence Trump will do the right thing in world affairs.)

Aside from slights and rhetoric, the US-SA relationship has remained remarkably unchanged under Trump. Trump did not carry out threats to slash funds to an admirable example of US largesse, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS relief (PEPFAR) -- which has provided US $6.2 billion since the George W. Bush years to assist South Africa with one of world's largest HIV/AIDS burdens.

And despite Trump's controversial 2018 tweet amplifying false claims about land seizures and the "" large-scale killing "" of White farmers, he did not follow up on lobbying by White rightist organizations to curb US assistance to South Africa because of concerns over proposed expropriation of White-owned farmland

It's simplistic to assume that any Trump support that exists in Africa only comes from the White right. While many South Africans often view Trump's behavior as crass, others I've encountered see him as an admirably blunt crusader against political correctness and bureaucratic inertia. One example: Unathi Kwaza, who has served on the on the board of Free Market Foundation and on the council of the Institute of Race Relations, says that while she disagrees with Trump's tariff wars with China, she would love to see him in office for the next four years. ""He rubs the media the wrong way because he has never been politically correct. For me that is a great thing,"" she told me. ""There's nothing worse than not knowing what a person is really thinking because they're afraid others wouldn't approve.""

Trump's stance on Israel has also drawn strong but quiet support from some sectors of South Africa's shrinking Jewish community , which numbers barely more than 50,000, equivalent to only 0.1% of the country's population of 58 million

The dazzle of US power and influence can even beguile some who normally toe the ANC line. Mining tycoon Patrice Motsepe, a brother-in-law of Ramaphosa, had to backtrack rapidly after telling Trump at a World Economic Forum dinner in Davos that Africans love him and ""we want you to do well."" Motsepe, after sharp public criticism, had to apologize for appearing to take on the mantle of spokesperson for Africa.

From a developing world perspective, a salutary effect of the Trump years is that any American assumptions of exceptionalism have surely been shattered. Old and bitter social divides, long glossed over, are now on full display.

America has revealed itself to be a nation as fallible as any other -- a nation that is struggling to mount the transparently ""free and fair"" elections that it has long lectured less fortunate countries on, and a nation where the incumbent hints at refusing to leave office on the basis of a ""stolen"" vote, long before the election has even taken place.

It is the nature of feelings of national exceptionalism that a country imagines itself not only to be the center of the universe but to be more benign than others actually experience it. For those of us watching from a distance, the reality has proven to be somewhat different."

(CNN) Europe, but particularly France and Germany -- the two motor nations of the continent -- are holding their collective breath for the outcome of Tuesday's American presidential election. They recognize that the future of the trans-Atlantic relationship, the very nature of the Atlantic alliance, which has preserved the peace in Europe for three-quarters of a century, hangs in the balance.

However, there is a dawning recognition in both nations that some elements of a decades-long trans-Atlantic partnership may be all but irrevocably lost -- regardless of who wins in America next month.

There is considerable uncertainty both in Paris and Berlin as to just how much the United States can be trusted any more. ""Donald Trump has not fallen down from the sky out of nowhere,"" Jana Puglierin, head of the German office of the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) told me in a Zoom conversation from Berlin. ""He has not taken half of the American population hostage and kind of brainwashed them. So there is a reason why he is there, and the reason remains even after he leaves.""

Still, Germans, and especially the French, may be forgiven for being somewhat distracted at this moment. Even more immediate and frightening for Europe than the US elections is the sudden resurgence of coronavirus infection for which the United States has been of little help and certainly no model for containment."
The world is facing an insane danger that's greater than Covid-19 (opinion),['Opinion Ira Helfand'],"Ira Helfand is an emergency medicine physician and co-president of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW), which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985.

(CNN) Honduras just became the 50th nation to ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) on Saturday. The accord has now met the required threshold to enter into force in 90 days -- on January 22.

This event marks the first time since Hiroshima that the simple possession of nuclear weapons will be deemed a crime under international law -- though it is not binding on nations who do not sign it. The treaty's entry into force could not be timelier.

The President of the United States has the ability to launch a nuclear attack on his own authority, without requiring the authorization of Congress, the Cabinet, the vice president or the Joint Chiefs. It is hard to imagine a more perfect example of the insane danger that we continue to live with as long as we maintain massive arsenals of nuclear weapons.

Even a healthy person, possessed of sound judgment, should not have the ability to launch these terrible weapons. The consequences are simply too great, and people are, well ... human. As humans, we are prone to mistakes, and the technology we have created is too.

Many errors can be corrected. A nuclear war cannot. Studies over the last decade have shown that even a limited nuclear war, involving less than one or two percent of the world's nuclear arsenal, would kill tens of millions directly. Even worse, it would cause worldwide climate disruption and famine putting billions of people at risk and ending civilization as we know it.

Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, the danger of nuclear war was growing at an alarming rate. Experts, like former Secretary of Defense William Perry, have warned that we are closer to nuclear war than we have ever been and the expert panel at the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists have set their iconic Doomsday Clock to 100 seconds to midnight, the closest it has ever been to Armageddon.

So, even as we cope with the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed over a million people worldwide, and the economic turmoil it has caused, it is critical that we move as rapidly as we can to eliminate nuclear weapons and the imminent, existential threat they pose.

And this past week, The New York Times reported that the US took the unprecedented step of pressuring countries that have joined the Treaty to withdraw from it. Given their failure to join the TPNW, will the Treaty make a difference?

Yes, according to former Secretary Perry, who has strongly endorsed the accord. ""The new UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons is an important step towards delegitimizing nuclear war as an acceptable risk of modern civilization,"" he said.

As the TPNW enters into force, the nine nuclear powers will not automatically disarm. But the non-nuclear nations and civil society can use the agreement to pressure them into making fundamental changes in their nuclear policy. The TPNW can be used to stigmatize these weapons so they are no longer seen as global status symbols and bulwarks of national security, but rather as the threat to human survival that they really are.

Here in the US we need to understand that national security can only be achieved by the total elimination of all nuclear weapons across the globe. We need to urgently pursue negotiations with all of the other nuclear states for a verifiable, enforceable, time bound agreement to dismantle all nuclear weapons. We may not be able to persuade the other nuclear states to go along with nuclear disarmament, but we don't know that because we have never tried.

To support the international effort embodied in the TPNW, scientists and physicians, faith leaders and defense experts have launched the Back from the Brink campaign to build support for the US to launch these negotiations. The campaign also calls on the US to take several intermediary steps to lessen the danger as these negotiations proceed."
US election 2020: What India thinks of the US election (opinion),['Opinion Pramit Pal Chaudhuri'],"Pramit Pal Chaudhuri is a Distinguished Fellow at the Ananta Aspen Centre and consulting foreign editor at the Hindustan Times. He is based in New Delhi. The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) India has long been one of the more pro-American countries in the world. While President Donald Trump doesn't enjoy the same support as predecessors former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush -- presumably because of his trade threats and his restrictions on visas for highly-skilled workers, most of which go to Indians -- that broad approval remains largely intact, with 56% of Indians polled saying they had confidence in Trump to do the right thing on world affairs.

Indian diplomats say privately that handling the Trump administration has been complicated. At one level, India and the US have continued to move their nascent strategic relationship forward with mutual concerns about China's territorial and political assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific serving as the backdrop. The US president and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have gone out of their respective ways to rub shoulders and share podiums with each other over the past four years. New Delhi and Washington have never been closer in military and economic terms. The Trump administration is credited for giving India far greater access to defense technology, for example, than any previous US government.

At the highest level, India has had to work hard to cater to Trump's personal liking for the theatrical and his determination to win small but symbolically important battles in trade and immigration for his domestic constituents. The then-Indian foreign secretary and now Foreign Minister, S. Jaishankar, told India's commentariat in 2017, "" Don't demonize Trump , analyze Trump. He represents a thought process.""

He could have been describing the Indian government's entire approach to the US president.

Modi has courted the US administration by inviting Ivanka Trump to India, inviting Trump himself to an Indian-American ""Howdy Modi"" rally in Houston and, most spectacularly, ensuring the US president received the largest possible audience during his visit to India with events that included a 100,000-strong rally in Gujarat.

All of this allowed Indian and US officials to soften the hard edges of Trump's trade and immigration policies and facilitate White House approval of other bilateral agreements.

But does this mean that Modi would be worried if Trump is not reelected? Almost certainly not.

Overall, Delhi is confident the Indo-US relationship is strong enough that it doesn't matter who wins the presidency. Senior Indian officials say relations between the leaders of major countries are driven overwhelmingly by national interests and only marginally by personalities. They point to Modi's excellent working relationship with Obama, whom Modi invited to be chief guest at India's Republic Day parade. Obama was the first US president to receive this honor. Their political views were miles apart, but they bonded strongly on issues like climate change and other issues.

And while they worry that Joe Biden would waste time trying to embrace China in the way of the first few years of the Obama administration, they are familiar with many of the Biden foreign policy team and with Biden himself, who as a senator backed the US-India nuclear deal in 2008.

While it is common to claim Modi and Trump are part of a larger global right-wing populist wave, the comparison is facile. The right-wing ideology of the BJP diverges significantly from that of Trump. Modi is best known for his religion-infused nationalism, but he is also a fervent proponent of climate action andr has massively expanded his country's welfare programs. At the Gujarat rally, with Trump sitting beside him, Modi used his closing remark s to list his policy accomplishments -- specifically mentioning his promotion of solar power, introducing a national healthcare system and passing India's first transgender rights law.

If Biden wins, the Indian government can be expected to re-engage on climate issues, an easing of immigration restrictions and a resumption of less rancorous trade talks. New Delhi would also like to shore up sagging multilateralism and expects a President Biden to be less eager to pull all US troops out of Afghanistan, a major point of difference with the Trump administration.

Biden, for his part, has promised to work with India on issues like fighting terrorism and curbing China.

However, a Biden administration would also have its differences with Modi's nationalist agenda. One area of disagreement is the Modi government's changes to Kashmir's constitutional status and its refugee policies. Democrats have criticized these policies as human rights abuses that are biased against Muslims; Indian officials argue that these are a misunderstanding of what the legislation sought to accomplish.

The real geopolitical glue, as was the case with the Trump administration, will be how much convergence Biden and Modi have on tackling China. New Delhi gave President Trump high scores for standing up to Beijing. Even though Trump was often erratic, Indian diplomats believe his administration recognized the threat posed by China and articulated a robust US Indo-Pacific policy. While Biden has also spoken out against China, New Delhi is unclear how willing a President Biden will be take steps against Beijing when his administration clearly would want to focus on domestic issues like health care and the Covid-19 pandemic.

Indians, great admirers of the US and its technological capabilities, have been bewildered at how the nation has blundered its way through the pandemic. While both countries have struggled to contain the virus, Modi's approach could not have been more different to Trump's.

When it became clear India's rickety healthcare system and unruly federal structure were failing to contain the virus, Modi agreed to impose one of the severest economic lockdowns in the world. On most points, Trump took a different track: undermining the medical experts and advocating against lockdown as much as possible. India has fared better as a consequence, with India's active cases falling since late September and a mortality rate that is now about 1.5%, compared to the US's 2.6%.

More importantly for Modi is that his handling of the pandemic improved his already sky-high approval ratings

Indian politicians meanwhile have taken to buffing their own pandemic records by comparing them to the US. Delhi chief minister and opposition leader, Arvind Kejriwal, bragged that when it came to Covid-19 policies, ""What Delhi did yesterday, America does today."" Trump, in turn, has compared the US's record on testing favorably to that of India's and claimed India and other countries are not giving proper counts of their Covid fatality numbers. While there is a kernel of truth in both statements, Indians find it almost a matter of pride to be treated as a benchmark by a country with a per capita income over 30 times their own.

US election 2020: What a Trump win will mean for Putin (opinion),['Opinion Mikhail Fishman'],"Mikhail Fishman is a Russian independent journalist and broadcaster, anchor at TV Rain network, former editor in chief of the Moscow Times and writer of The Man Who Was Too Free, an award-winning feature length documentary on Boris Nemtsov. The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) This time four years ago, officials in Moscow were preparing -- along with the rest of the world -- for what appeared to be inevitable: a Hillary Clinton presidency. It was a grim prospect for Russian President Vladimir Putin at a time Russia was overwhelmed by a string of scandals.

That summer, the world had learned about the massive state-sponsored doping program in Russian sport. In September, a Dutch-led international investigation found that Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, shot down while flying over Ukraine, had been downed by a Russian missile , killing all 298 on board. Around the same time, Russia launched a brutal bombing campaign on the Syrian city of Aleppo, killing hundreds of civilians and devastating the city.

A Clinton victory would have put Putin into a difficult position. Clinton was hawkish on Russia and was expected to marshal a coalition of Western leaders to try to isolate Russia. Donald Trump, by contrast, was seen inside the Kremlin as someone who wouldn't try to build this type of alliance. An opportunistic and anti-establishment American leader like Trump, the thinking went, would allow the Western world to start imploding from within.

Back then, Putin's response to the challenge was ambivalent. Clearly alarmed by Clinton's predicted victory, he said it was absurd to suggest that Trump was his preferred candidate and appeared to be cautiously suggesting Moscow and Washington should start afresh. At the same time, Russia's hacking into Clinton's campaign in order to prevent her from winning became one of the central issues of the election.

Astonishingly, not that much seems to have changed as Americans vote four years later.

As in 2016, Russia's state-connected agencies are accused of trying to mobilize Trump supporters via social media and US intelligence agencies maintain that Putin is ""probably directing"" a disinformation campaign to ""denigrate"" the Democratic candidate. (Russia denies the accusations of election interference, with Foreign Affairs Minister Sergey Lavrov saying last month that "" there are no grounds for such statements."")

And last week, Putin backed down in negotiations over the New START arms reduction treaty, saying Russia was willing to agree to freeze its nuclear arsenals in order to extend the accord. This unexpected move seemed designed to give Trump a diplomatic win ahead of the US election.

Putin has said he'll work with whoever wins the White House , but Moscow realizes it can't bank on Biden being as accommodating to the Kremlin as Trump. Washington is expected to impose new sanctions on Russia over the recent poisoning of Russian opposition leader and fierce Putin critic Alexey Navalny with a military-grade nerve agent, but a Biden administration is expected to take an even tougher approach than Trump. The Kremlin presumably also expects a Democratic administration to exert more pressure on Russian officials and state-connected oligarchs on corporate and personal levels.

Still, sanctions, as sensitive as they may be, will hardly be a game-changer. Putin's Russia has already got used to sanctions. Moreover, as the confrontation keeps growing over Navalny's poisoning, the Kremlin has shown a willingness to stand its ground and even raise tensions by pushing back against critics. ""We probably simply have to temporarily stop talking to those people in the West who are responsible for foreign policy and don't understand the need for mutually respectful dialogue,"" Foreign Minister Lavrov said this month after EU foreign ministers agreed to impose sanctions on Russian officials and organizations blamed for Navalny's poisoning.

Putin, for his part, recently indicated that he couldn't care less about the West treating him as all but a murderer and imposing sanctions on those close to him. ""I have had a long time to get used to these attacks,"" he said. ""It has no effect on me.""

From an internal political standpoint, Putin can afford to rebuff the West. Amplified by official propaganda, anti-Western -- mostly, anti-American -- sentiment is deeply rooted in the Russian mindset. Sixty percent of Russian respondents told the independent Levada Center that they consider the US to be hostile to Russia and the concept that Russia is a nation under siege remains a cornerstone of Putin's legitimacy.

While Russia's political establishment and general public applauded Trump's victory four years ago, the 2020 US election is attracting less attention. The latest Levada poll found that the majority of Russians do not care about its outcome and 65% think the winner won't make a difference for Russia. Sixteen percent support Trump, nine percent support Biden -- not surprising given that national television portrays Trump in a positive light and presents Biden as a radical leftist old geezer.

More importantly, a Biden victory could mean the Kremlin will be again facing a more united West -- the same threat to Putin's agenda as four years ago, and in similar circumstances. Russia's denials about the poisoning of Navalny have flabbergasted Europe and probably have been the final nail in the coffin of French President Emmanuel Macron's plans to build trust with Russia.

A consolidated liberal front that includes a Biden-led US will also constitute a much greater challenge to Vladimir Putin's global ambitions from Syria to Ukraine, from Afghanistan to Belarus.

Consider Belarus, the former Soviet republic on Russia's western border. The rule of Alexander Lukashenko, its cruel and exasperating dictator, has been shaken after hundreds of thousands of Belarusians took to the streets across the whole country in response to what they considered a brazenly rigged presidential election. These mass protests were met with brutal force

For now, Russia has abstained from military intervention, and Lukashenko holds sway largely thanks to Putin's moral support. But how will Moscow react if Lukashenko starts losing ground? It's hard to tell, but it seems likely the Kremlin will think twice about direct involvement if it expects consolidated pressure from the West.

While tension between Russia and the West has grown, the key issue of the 2020 United States election remains unchanged. If the Trump era is extended for another term, it will be a victory for Putin in his zero-sum game with the West. If Trump is defeated, it will be a defeat for Putin too."
Colombian politicians shouldn't take sides in US election,"['Opinion Reps. Gregory Meeks', 'Ruben Gallego']","Rep. Gregory Meeks is a Democrat representing New York's 5th Congressional District in the US House of Representatives. Rep. Ruben Gallego is a Democrat representing Arizona's 7th Congressional District. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. Read more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) The United States and Colombia are close friends, and close friends speak honestly. That's why, as US elected representatives, we have a very clear message for our Colombian counterparts: Show us the respect of staying out of our elections.

In recent weeks, we have noticed a deeply troubling trend: Several Colombian politicians are publicly choosing sides in the US election. Politicians such as Senator María Fernanda Cabal, Senator Carlos Felipe Mejía, and Congressman Juan David Vélez -- a dual US-Colombian citizen, whom we could more reasonably expect to participate in American democracy -- have taken to social media, and one has taken to the press to take sides in America's upcoming presidential vote. Some have even repeated the fabrication that Vice President Joe Biden is a communist or a radical socialist. Earlier, Senator Gustavo Petro also weighed in, expressing a preference for Biden on Twitter

""WE WILL MAKE COLOMBIA GREAT AGAIN,"" Vélez wrote on Twitter this month, retweeting a President Trump tweet calling Biden a ""PUPPET of CASTRO-CHAVISTAS"" in the Democratic Party. Cabal insinuated Biden is controlled by the loose collection of left-leaning activists known as Antifa. Mejía tweeted a two-minute video from Latinos for Trump in which campaign aide Mercedes Schlapp, in response to Petro's endorsing Biden, calls Biden ""the candidate of the radical left"" and compares him to communists.

For the good of both of our countries, this kind of behavior has to end now.

Of course, we know that the individuals who have recently weighed in on our election hardly speak for all. Most Colombian politicians, including those in government, continue to respect our institutions and democratic processes. But just as we would call out any Democrats meddling in Colombia's elections, we believe recent side-taking demands an unequivocal response from our friends in Bogotá: that enough is enough.

Support for Colombia has never depended on whether a Democrat or Republican was in the White House -- nor, for that matter, on the party affiliation of Colombia's presidents. It should stay that way.

When we first noticed these actions, we were shocked that they were coming from Colombia, one of our closest democratic partners. We believe this amounts to a form of election interference: Biden is not a communist, and in spreading that message, the Colombian lawmakers saying this are misinforming American voters and citizens of their own country. The unscrupulous judgment of even just a handful of Colombian politicians hurts the country's image and credibility.

These public comments are deeply unethical. Absurd lies about Biden representing Fidel Castro or Hugo Chávez-style socialism are downright manipulative. And toying with the trauma of Colombians who have escaped left-wing guerrilla violence, and that of Venezuelans who have fled the tyrannical rule of Nicolás Maduro, is shameful. This fearmongering does nothing more than cruelly force diaspora families in the US to relive the pain of their dislocation.

The US has recently undergone a painful saga over foreign influence on our elections. After Russia's interference in 2016 and the probe conducted by Robert Mueller, which culminated in a 450-page report, prompted numerous arrests, foreign attempts to push US elections in any direction are an especially sensitive matter for our country. These comments do not help.

At the end of the day, though, this isn't about individual politicians. It's about a partnership built between our two countries over decades -- a partnership that we both need now more than ever.

Republicans and Democrats have disagreed in the past on crucial foreign policy issues, but when it comes to support for Colombia, there has long been consensus. Can you imagine negotiating our most significant accomplishments -- from Plan Colombia to the US-Colombia Free Trade Agreement -- without support from both parties? We doubt it. What about US support for Colombia's candidacy as both a NATO global partner and member of the OECD? Republicans and Democrats trade places in the White House every few years. Support for Colombia is a rare constant. Taking sides in US elections threatens to undermine the strategic relationship.

None of us wants to see our partnership suffer. That's because we know how much our countries can achieve when we work side by side. Today, Colombia is far safer and more prosperous than it was twenty years ago -- an accomplishment built on the backs of our brave Colombian partners and facilitated by across-the-aisle support here in the US. Colombia is once again facing a series of unprecedented challenges, including the Covid-19 pandemic, an economic downturn, a spike in insecurity and the Venezuelan refugee and migrant crisis. Regardless of whether Biden wins the White House come November, we want nothing more than to sustain -- in fact, to increase -- our cooperation with Colombia to tackle these challenges together.

But partnership is not a guarantee. It relies on mutual trust. When Colombian politicians choose sides, they put all of that hard-won goodwill in danger.

With so much uncertainty and so much at stake, now is not the time to play with fire. Now is not the time to burn bridges. It's the time to strengthen the ones we have built -- regardless of party -- together. To do otherwise is short sighted and promises to endanger one of the hemisphere's most essential relationships."
The pandemic could push 49 million Africans into extreme poverty. Here's how other countries can help (opinion),"['Tony Blair For Cnn Business Perspectives', 'Tony Blair For']","Tony Blair was prime minister of the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2007. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

It is now widely recognized that in Africa, the Covid-19 pandemic is on a different trajectory than much of the rest of the world, including the West. While relatively low levels of testing obscure the full picture, death rates have been significantly lower; health systems, while sometimes strained, have not been overwhelmed; and the latest serological studies suggest that while infection rates in Africa have been high, a great deal of these infections have been asymptomatic .

Meanwhile, in the rest of the world, rising cases and the imminent threat of a second wave have caused countries across Europe and Asia to move toward new restrictions and partial lockdowns.

There are multiple hypotheses as to why and how Africa has escaped the worst-case predictions, ranging from the demographics of a young population to climate and potential resistance due to exposure to other Covid strains . Across a diverse continent, the true answer is likely to be a combination of factors, but we lack sufficient scientific evidence at this stage to reach final conclusions.

However, if Africa has escaped the worst of the pandemic in health terms, the same cannot be said of Covid-19's economic impact, where the collateral damage has been huge.

Foreign direct investment has declined 40%, some 30 million jobs are expected to be lost and up to 49 million more Africans could be pushed into extreme poverty as they lose their livelihoods in the informal sector working as street vendors, taxi drivers and the like. Interruptions in health services and supplies due to Covid-19 are also expected to worsen broader health outcomes. HIV, tuberculosis and malaria deaths may rise by around half a million people

As countries reopen, there is an urgent need to assess the scale of the collateral damage caused by lockdowns, both within Africa and globally, so leaders can make the best choices about how to rebuild their countries' economies.

As they do that, African leaders must maintain their commitment to containing Covid-19 by continuing to test and isolate. Here, the West should show some humility and acknowledge that while the full set of drivers behind Africa's lower mortality will not be known for a while yet, its systems, institutions and leaders have, in many cases, made a critical difference.

After their first confirmed case, the average Sub-Saharan African country imposed more stringent containment measures, and did so more quickly than the average European Union country and the United States. Most African countries have also adopted comprehensive contact tracing policies and some, such as Sierra Leone, have gone so far as to supervise the isolation of all contacts, regardless of whether they are symptomatic, for 14 days after exposure.

African governments have built and adjusted contact tracing and isolation policies that fit with their contexts and cultures, applying a key lesson from previous battles with Ebola and other diseases on the importance of ensuring community buy-in and acceptance of measures. While this hasn't been done perfectly, many African governments have been far more successful at ensuring isolation of high-risk contacts than other governments, including the UK.

Unfortunately, despite lower case numbers and, in many cases, tighter control measures than other countries on European or UK safe fly lists, African countries have paid the price of disconnection from the rest of the world, with the majority of its population being unfairly treated as a single, risky entity.

EU countries and the UK have put in place 14-day quarantines and other medical travel restrictions for all arriving passengers from Africa except for Rwanda (which is on the EU safe travel list) and the Seychelles and Mauritius, which have safe travel corridors with the UK. (The US lacks a common national approach to quarantines and the situation is less clear cut there.) These measures risk exacerbating the economic damage their countries have already sustained.

African economies are highly dependent on global trade and travel -- whether for the import of essential goods, the implementation of critical infrastructure and aid projects or for tourism and business travel. As a result, these measures risk exacerbating the economic damage their countries have already sustained.

Although African GDP is not expected to fall as much as that of other advanced economies', its rapid population growth, large informal employment sector, governments' inability to boost economic activity by increasing state spending and weak social welfare systems mean its population -- especially the poor -- will take a larger hit, undoing a decade's developmental progress.

Reconnecting with the world and recovering economically will require verifiable proof of vaccination or negative tests.

It will mean ensuring equity in vaccine development and distribution. The COVAX initiative led by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Global Vaccine Alliance (GAVI) and The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is working to ensure African countries can gain access to vaccines.

In addition, the current model of supplying Africa with vaccines produced elsewhere has to be reconsidered. African leaders must play a part in the development of new vaccines, have a stake in vaccine manufacturing and be allowed to deploy the right vaccine strategies for their population. The climate and geological characteristics of places like Africa and Asia mean they are most likely to be the source of new viral species. Investing in research and manufacturing of vaccines in these places therefore builds resilience for the entire world, not just those continents.

I have long argued that the West needs to reframe its relationship with Africa from one of aid and extractive trade, where the West largely dictates the terms, to one of partnership. This partnership should be based on developing African nations in areas like trade and investment that add value and create jobs locally and that enhance Africa's security. This reframing can be one of the positive outcomes of the pandemic.

We should establish such a relationship now, in the struggle against Covid-19, drawing on the experience, resources and energy of African countries as valued partners, not mere beneficiaries, ensuring the continent is not left behind as the world reopens. By doing so, we would not only bring the pandemic to a swifter and more complete conclusion, we would lay the foundations of a safer, more prosperous world."
Opinion: The single most important quality a president must have,"['Opinion David Gergen', 'Cnn Senior Political Analyst']","Watch the full conversation with SE Cupp and her panel of experts on ""What Comes Next?"" here .

(CNN) This week, we ask the question: What comes next for America and the presidency? President Donald Trump upended countless longstanding norms when he took office, prompting Americans, foreign allies and enemies alike to wonder, what does the office of the presidency really stand for? In our CNN Digital video conversation, we'll discuss whether the American presidency has been transformed and redefined forever, but first we start with a prescription for its restoration, in a piece by David Gergen.

One night after moving into a brand new White House in November 1800, then-President John Adams wrote to his wife Abigail and included a short prayer: ""I pray Heaven to bestow the best of Blessings on this House, and on all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise Men ever rule under this roof.""

Former President Franklin D. Roosevelt loved the prayer so much that in 1945 he had it engraved in the mantel above a stone fireplace in the State Dining Room. The Kennedys were so enamored that they had it carved into a new marble mantel in the early 1960s. In her memoir, Hillary Clinton expressed her hope that the prayer be extended to women of good character, too.

These sentiments about honor and wisdom, shared for over two centuries by our best presidents, are now at the center of this year's presidential contest. We are in the midst of a political crisis, searching for leaders we can trust. There was a time in the mid-20th century when we took for granted that our presidents would be and would command respect. No longer.

When I was a youngster, Dwight Eisenhower was in the White House. During his first campaign, voters overwhelmingly believed him both trustworthy and likable. One of his top advisers capitalized on these findings and created the campaign slogan, ""I like Ike."" That slogan quickly became one of the most popular in political history. And Eisenhower went on to serve two terms in the White House, enjoying, according to Gallup, an average approval rating of 65% -- an astonishing number by today's standards.

The years that followed, though, brought a cascade of lies from Washington, as we suffered through the Vietnam War and Watergate era. Within a decade, faith in the federal government as a whole dropped 41 points

While those numbers recovered somewhat from that low point in the 1970s, they have never fully rebounded. Faith in elected leaders rose to 55% in 2002, but by 2015 -- just before Trump took office -- it had dropped again , this time to only 19% of Americans saying they trusted the federal government all or most of the time.

And a recent Pew poll measuring international sentiments across 13 countries found that the international community was more trusting of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping than of Trump.

These things matter. A president cannot get big things done here at home unless he can marshal the support of a sizable majority of the people. Sure, recent presidents have exercised power more frequently through executive orders, but those aren't lasting in their impact: The next president can easily reverse them, as Trump has demonstrated . Nor can a president easily persuade other advanced nations to embrace controversial policies unless they believe he is a reliable friend.

Indeed, I believe that the restoration of trust should be the single highest priority of our next president. Everything else will flow from there.

Yes, it seems impossible to imagine such a reality if Trump is re-elected, particularly since he is the least honest president in recent memory. But here are three suggestions for a potential Joe Biden administration -- and let's hope against hope that the Republican Party at large is also listening:

First, our next president should set a new tone in the White House on day one, proclaiming that honesty, dignity and respect for others will be the new marching orders. In the aftermath of Watergate, when former President Richard Nixon was forced out in disgrace, I saw his successor -- Gerald Ford -- change the atmosphere within hours. Ford proclaimed ""that truth is the glue"" that holds us all together. He believed it and soon his followers did, too.

Later on, I learned that in Nixon's final days, the Democrats' two leaders on Capitol Hill, Carl Albert and Mike Mansfield, had been highly influential in persuading Nixon to appoint Ford to a vice presidential vacancy. Why? Because he was a man they could trust.

Second, our next president needs every department to review and refresh its ethics codes and then require every new political appointee to attend no-nonsense briefings on what is in bounds and what is out of bounds. I can't remember any ethics briefing when I joined the Nixon White House, but I can well remember a tough -- and eye-opening -- briefing when I arrived at President Clinton's State Department. Warren Christopher was the secretary of state, and he was a stickler for honesty and openness.

Ethics officers have the ability to keep government officials out of trouble. Coming into one administration, for example, I learned that if, as a private citizen, I had accepted the occasional offer of a friend to use his private driver to carry me across town, I would have to declare those rides as taxable income. That may sound trivial, but, trust me, it was not.

Third, our next president needs to review and overhaul those who now serve as inspectors general across the federal landscape. For decades, IGs have played the essential role of providing nonpartisan oversight of the federal government. But so many IGs have come and gone in the Trump years that few can tell which federal officials are completely honest and who might be covering for the White House's indiscretions.

The Offices of Inspectors General need a thorough scrubbing and perhaps a fresh start, with new appointees who are, as the old saying goes, cleaner than a hound's teeth.

In writing his magisterial biography of Harry Truman, historian David McCullough concluded that character is the single most important quality a president must have. I have learned over time that McCullough was right.

Young men and women on a White House staff and working in government departments and agencies take their cues from their boss, the president. If he or she is open and honest, that is the path they will walk; but if he or she acts more like a mobster, bullying and lying to those in his midst, some of them will eventually copy this behavior.

So, the question before us is simple: Will the wise and the honest prevail over the next four years? The answer really rests with you, the voters. You are the ultimate stewards of our democracy."
Opinion: American elections have become a drama frustratingly divorced from democracy,['Opinion Jeremi Suri'],"Jeremi Suri holds the Mack Brown Distinguished Chair for Leadership in Global Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, where he is a professor of history and public affairs. He is the author and editor of nine books, most recently "" The Impossible Presidency: The Rise and Fall of America's Highest Office. "" The views expressed here are his. Read more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) Americans' assumptions about elections in the United States do not match the current or historical reality. With few exceptions, American elections have been messy , time-consuming, contested and sometimes violent. The frustrating uncertainty about the 2020 contest between Joe Biden and President Donald Trump is startling only because we do not know our own history, and refuse to recognize the inherited weaknesses in our democratic system which we must, at last, reform.

American national elections are probably the most decentralized in the world . Each state sets its own rules, and thousands of counties collect and tabulate the ballots. Two neighborhoods divided by a county line are likely to offer different voting hours, voting machines and counting methods. Two states sharing a border are likely to have vastly different rules for how citizens register to vote, and whether they can vote early, by mail or in a drive-thru facility.

The decentralized nature of American elections provides some security against efforts at national or foreign sabotage, but it also causes confusion for citizens. Watching election returns Tuesday night, I could see it was very difficult for viewers to understand which ballots (early, mail, in-person?) were being counted, and what they represented for overall electoral results. The variation in vote counting procedures in Pennsylvania and Florida , two key swing states, for instance, made it difficult to interpret who was really winning.

Complexity and decentralization, while they help prevent a widespread co-opting or disruption of our elections by bad actors, also allow local officials to manipulate voting rules, disenfranchising millions of voters. County voting commissioners and secretaries of state have consistently used barriers -- including poll taxes, literacy tests and onerous registration requirements -- to deny citizens their right to vote.

This was particularly true in Southern states from the late 19th century until the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 . In recent decades, state and country leaders have distorted voter turnout in less obvious ways, limiting voting locations for certain populations while offering extensive voting opportunities for favored groups. These practices continue today

Intimidation, cheating and threats of violence have also been common elements of American elections. As recently as the mid-20th century, candidates and their allies helped supporters to vote multiple times, some even after they died.

The most famous example is Lyndon Johnson's election to the US Senate in 1948 , when turnout of the deceased surged in the last hours to give the young Texan the last few votes he need, in alphabetical order. Decades earlier, urban political machines like Tammany Hall in New York frequently gathered poor workers from factories, filled them with drink, and transported them to voting locations with a prepared ballot. Partisanship was about much more than politics; it was a required part of employment for a number of citizens.

Stricter federal law enforcement has largely eliminated these forms of fraud from American elections. The federal Consent Decree of 1982, for instance, prohibited employers or activists from loitering near polls, and conducting similar activities, to intimidate voters . But other kinds of bias and bullying have become common , especially after a federal court refused the extend the Consent Decree in November 2016, following a complaint against Donald Trump's first presidential campaign.

The real election corruption today centers on suppressing votes and limiting the ability to count them. In many states, including Texas, citizens concerned about Covid-19 had to choose between risking exposure or not voting. Thousands who voted legally by mail have had their ballots disqualified because the post office slowed their delivery.

Social media has become a ubiquitous and invasive channel for intimidating, shaming and spreading misinformation. The rise of the conspiratorial political social media site, QAnon, is an example of how information can be weaponized to manipulate voters and amplified by the President. At least one QAnon follower, Marjorie Taylor Greene, has now been elected to House of Representatives from Georgia. She is not the first conspiracy promoter elected to Congress, but one of the most outrageous recent examples.

President Trump, who refused to renounce QAnon , is the most prominent bully and spreader of misinformation that confuses voters . His false claim that states should not count all the legal votes against him -- unprecedented in American history -- is the most recent example of his bullying and intimidation. His campaign has filed suit to stop the counting of ballots in Michigan, even after the state completed its count.

What we hear, see and feel today is a manifestation of this long, troubling history of American elections. This year we witnessed an exciting surge in voter turnout, but the total number of voters strangely matters less than where they voted.

The thousands of new voters in California, for example, have no effect on the electoral vote totals for president. Rural counties in sparsely populated states, like Montana and Wyoming, have a disproportionate influence on the choice of president. Washington, DC is underrepresented with only three electoral votes and Puerto Rico is excluded completely from the election of national leaders.

Saturated with television and social media, our elections have become a drama frustratingly divorced from democracy. We are not watching the enactment of the popular will, but instead a game where the rules are intricately complex and manipulated by particular actors. We have become avid spectators, rather than active citizens choosing those who best represents us.

We are confused by what we see, horrified by how it plays out, and deeply dissatisfied with the process, even when our candidate wins. In the current media environment, our elections breed cynicism and division, degrading our democracy each cycle.

What should we do? Lashing out against one politician or party only makes things worse. We must remember that our elections have a long, difficult history. We can use that history to draw attention to inherited problems and motivate a search for alternatives. We must recognize that we are a very flawed democracy in how we choose our leaders. Other democracies offer possibilities for reform that we might consider.

We need to start a conversation about electoral reform as a society. It will not be easy, but it offers a therapeutic possibility. The current frustration is only made worse with every election. Working to change the system, beginning locally perhaps, we can at least feel like we are doing something useful.

I am so tired of counting electoral votes on a map. I want to be part of a system that elects the best among us to lead, and, to cite Abraham Lincoln, inspires ""the better angels of our nature."""

Presented with an opportunity for a wholesale rejection of a highly divisive, race-baiting, xenophobic, media-hating, anti-science, lying, juvenile incumbent, a sizable swath of America's voters decided to take a pass and pull the lever for Donald Trump, and that speaks volumes about who we are as a nation.

But all this didn't happen in a vacuum; the world has been watching.

Joe Biden may still end up winning this election, but no matter how you cut it, it was clear here and around the globe that roughly half of America believes that the character of our President doesn't matter all that much, an impeachment is meaningless and the Department of Justice really should serve as the chief executive's personal law firm.

It's now more than obvious that a good chunk of American voters are OK with a President who desecrates symbols of American power like the White House, where he has told countless lies promoted endless false truths and broken a host of norms that have transcended politics for generations.

More importantly, from a global perspective, roughly one in two of American voters signaled to the world that not only are capricious trade wars palatable, but long-standing global alliances like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) don't matter anymore.

What about withholding funding from the World Health Organization amid a global pandemic that has claimed well over a million lives across the globe? Many voters apparently thought that was OK. Abrogating leadership on the existential issue of climate change? Another check.

Not to mention what this split decision says about the US and our moral fabric on the topics of social justice, racial equality and inclusiveness.

Even if Joe Biden ekes out razor-thin margins in the remaining contests that have yet to be called, he will inherit the keys to a White House that must try to govern and attempt to unify two vastly different sides that approach our nation's place in the world from completely opposite vantage points.

On Tuesday night, Democrats learned that ""America First"" is not just hollow and meaningless campaign jargon meant to fire up Trump's base -- it's actually a summation of how many in this country actually see our place in the world. America, the country that has historically been able to coalesce around bipartisan issues such as promoting free trade and forging strong, international alliances, is no more, it seems.

On one hand, a President Joe Biden would have to find ways to appease the progressive wing of his own party that will demand bold and decisive action on climate change, health care, economic reform and a host of other issues at odds with the other half of the country. While on the right, he will face an emboldened GOP that will see the results of Senate and congressional races as a validation of their particular policy prescriptions.

And, unlike any president before him, Biden would have to contend with a new, third vector of influence and pressure -- an embattled ex-president who will have no qualms about voicing his opinions on an hour-by-hour basis to a rabidly loyal and very likely disgruntled base, one Tweet at a time.

Even if he wins, it's not going to be an easy road ahead for Joe Biden, a man who has already suffered so much and sacrificed plenty.

And then there's the other possibility -- that President Trump somehow hangs on to the Rust Belt and squeaks by with a victory of his own. Handing four more years to a man so thoroughly derided by Western leaders on the international stage will only further embolden our adversaries and leave our traditional allies searching more aggressively for new economic partnerships and security pacts. Our friends across the world can no longer count on us to do the right thing.

No matter who wins this election, America is already weaker for it. We had an opportunity as a country to turn a page on this dark chapter in our history, but we, as a people and a nation, came up well short."
Why Pennsylvania should take its time counting votes (opinion),"['Opinion Van Jones', 'Lawrence Lessig']","CNN host Van Jones is the CEO of the REFORM Alliance, a criminal justice organization. Lawrence Lessig is the Roy L. Furman Professor of Law and Leadership at Harvard Law School and the author of the book They Don't Represent Us: Reclaiming Our Democracy . The views expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) Election night is over, but the election is not. And given the unexpectedly tight race, Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes may be those that decide who wins the White House. To be sure, Biden still has a path to victory that doesn't involve Pennsylvania, but he could end up needing the state if he suffers reverses elsewhere.

The key for Pennsylvania to have an orderly and complete vote count is for the state to take its time. And the key precedent that should show Pennsylvania that it may take its time is not Florida in 2000, but Hawaii in 1960. Even though Richard Nixon said it should not be a precedent, what he did in 1960 should be the model for this election in 2020.

In 1960, Hawaii's vote was incredibly close. On the first count, Nixon had beaten John F. Kennedy by 141 votes. On November 28, the acting governor certified a Republican slate of electors. They met on December 19 and cast their ballots for Nixon.

But a recount showed that, in fact, Kennedy had won the popular vote by an even closer margin of 115 votes . That recount had been completed on December 30, 11 days after the Republican electors from Hawaii had cast their votes for Nixon. Five days later, the governor sent Congress a new certification of electors, this time naming the Democratic electors as the electors properly chosen by Hawaii's voters. That certification arrived in Congress on January 6, the day that Congress was to count the electoral votes. When then Vice President Nixon, who the Constitution had set as the custodian of the electoral votes, began to ""open all the certificates"" as the Constitution directs him, and came to Hawaii in the list of states, he announced that there were two slates of electors from Hawaii, one Republican and one Democratic.

This was not the first time that Congress had been sent multiple slates of electors from a single state. In 1876 , because of fierce partisan conflict, a handful of states had each sent two slates of electors to Congress, triggering a constitutional crisis that could easily have triggered a second Civil War.

Eleven years later, Congress enacted a statute to resolve such conflicts. In the election after the enactment of the Electoral Count Act of 1887, Oregon sent a second set of returns as a joke. This time, the second slate was discarded without any fear of civil war. (The record does not indicate whether anyone laughed at the joke.)

But Hawaii is the only case since 1876 when a state, with sincerity, sent the votes of more than one slate of electors to Congress. And while the three votes from America's 50th state would ultimately not matter to the result, they could have. Had the tight Illinois race -- which Kennedy won by around 9,000 votes -- gone for Nixon and shifted a few reluctant Democrats in the Dixiecrat south, Hawaii's votes could have flipped the result from Kennedy to Nixon.

In the days leading up to January 6 , Nixon's team had tried hard to engineer such a result. But it was clear on the morning of the 6th that they had failed. Nixon accepted his fate and chose not to allow any Congressional challenge of the second slate of Democratic electors from Hawaii. As he is recorded as saying , ""In order not to delay the further count of the electoral vote here, the Chair, without the intent of establishing a precedent, suggests that the [Democratic] electors named in the certificate of the Governor of Hawaii dated January 4, 1961, be considered as the lawful electors from the State of Hawaii.""

The puzzle here is this: The Constitution specifies that it is Congress that sets the day on which the electors must meet in their own state to cast their ballots. That day must be the same across the United States. The framers' design was meant to avoid any possible coordination by electors from different states. Modern communications technology was just one more innovation the framers never anticipated. So if the Hawaii Democratic slate was only certified on January 4, how could they have voted more than two weeks earlier, on December 19, 1960?

The key -- and this is the critical fact for 2020 as well -- is that the Democratic slate had also met on December 19 , and had also cast their ballots in the manner specified by the Constitution. When they voted, no one knew whether their votes would matter. But at least someone recognized that the only way their votes could matter was if they were cast on the day that Congress had set. History does not record who had that genius legal insight.

That insight shows what should happen this year on December 14, 2020 , when the electors are to meet to cast their ballots. On that day, assuming the final count of the popular votes has not yet been certified, both slates of Pennsylvania presidential electors should meet in Harrisburg. Both slates should cast their votes by ballot. And Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf should await the final resolution of the popular vote count before he certifies which slate should represent the state. So long as that certification happens before January 6, there is nothing that should stop it from being counted by Congress.

Some might worry that this can't be done because of the Electoral Count Act's "" safe harbor "" provision that was at the core of the fight in Bush v. Gore.

Under this provision, Congress promises to count the votes of any slate of electors that has been certified at least six days before the Electoral College is to vote, under laws that had been written prior to the election. Under the scenario we're describing here, Pennsylvania's slate would not achieve ""safe harbor"" status. But the critical bit that the Supreme Court seemed to miss in Bush v. Gore is that safe harbor is not the only path to a slate being counted -- as Hawaii shows. If the state's governor has certified only one slate, the Electoral Count Act says that is the slate that Congress must count -- regardless of when it was certified.

Gov. Wolf should make these facts clear to Pennsylvanians and the nation now. He should not permit the frenzy of a ""safe harbor"" deadline (this year December 8 ) to wreck the possibility of an orderly count of Pennsylvania's votes. Wolf should declare that he will wait until there is a final certification, whenever that is. He should declare that he will assure that both slates of electors cast their votes on December 14, so that both slates may ultimately matter.

"Opinion: Progressives, here are five reasons to be optimistic",['Opinion Van Jones'],"CNN host Van Jones is the CEO of the REFORM Alliance, a criminal justice organization. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) If absentee ballot trends continue to trend blue, Democrats may secure a political victory in the race for the presidency. But we also wanted a moral victory. We wanted an overwhelming repudiation of horrific policies -- like separating migrant children from their parents at the border -- and hurtful rhetoric. We did not get that.

That does not mean that we lost -- or even that we should be discouraged. As I survey the landscape the morning after, and as millions of votes are still being counted, I see five points of optimism:

1) President-elect Joe Biden is still a real possibility. The former vice president is currently leading in Arizona and Nevada. CNN has projected Biden victories in Michigan and Wisconsin. And I believe he still has a shot at Pennsylvania as well. That means Biden could be the next president of the United States. He also . The former vice president is currently leading in Arizona and Nevada. CNN has projected Biden victories in Michigan and Wisconsin. And I believe he still has a shot at Pennsylvania as well. That means Biden could be the next president of the United States. He also racked up a historic win in the popular vote, breaking President Barack Obama's 2008 record for total votes cast. Though the Electoral College determines whether a candidate wins, the popular vote determines the winner's political mandate.

2) Leading Republicans are breaking with Trump on a critical issue. The nightmare scenario was always a close and contested election where a sitting president refused to concede -- and one party refused to leave office. While Trump has made outright false claims and demanded that states stop counting votes, many in this party is not backing him. So far -- and this could change -- prominent Republicans from former New Jersey Gov. . The nightmare scenario was always a close and contested election where a sitting president refused to concede -- and one party refused to leave office. While Trump has made outright false claims and demanded that states stop counting votes, many in this party is not backing him. So far -- and this could change -- prominent Republicans from former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio put country first and are demanding we count every vote, even if that means their standard bearer might lose.

3) The election could produce both an administration and introspection for the Democrats. Normally parties get one or the other. Either they win the election and get to govern the executive branch. Or they lose, and benefit from a deep, hard look at where they went wrong. Ironically, because Democrats' landslide did not materialize and yet they still appear well-poised to win the White House, we may benefit from both.

(CNN) No matter how the election ends, it is clear that American voters did not resoundingly repudiate President Donald Trump. That comes as a disappointment to those of us who have found much about his presidency dangerous and inexcusable, but it also demands a closer look at what produced this outcome.

The election confirmed how profoundly divided the country is -- and will be, whether our president is Trump or Joe Biden.

We already know how Trump will govern if he wins. If Biden wins, his pledge to bring Americans back together will prove just as monumental as the other problems he will face, including the pandemic and the shattered economy.

""We are campaigning as Democrats,"" Biden said Wednesday in remarks in Delaware, ""but I will govern as an American president. The presidency, itself, is not a partisan institution. It's the one office in this nation that represents everyone and it demands a duty of care for all Americans and that is precisely what I will do.""

In a healthy, well-functioning political system, the country should be able to come together to solve these problems. But it's not clear at this fractious moment whether such unity is likely or even possible.

To bring Americans together and respond to the people's needs, Biden will need to face the stark reality that nearly half of the voters supported Trump, even in the midst of the worst public health crisis in a century and the worst economic conditions since the Great Depression.

Why? Some of it may be because of poor tactical decisions by the Biden team. Much of it is because of Trump's willingness to lie shamelessly, to the point that many bought into his countless lies, always with the unflagging support of the complicit Republicans and the right-wing media machine. But that doesn't tell the whole story.

Biden seems to have made a mistake by focusing so much of his campaign on the pandemic. It made sense to do that, but he should have also worked hard to counter Trump's phony claim that he had built the best economy in the country's history until the coronavirus struck. Exit polls , if we can believe them, show the economy was the voters' top concern, with the pandemic ranking a distant third.

Trump's persistence in downplaying the virus apparently persuaded many voters.

Indeed, Biden may well trimmed his prospects by taking the ethical path of campaigning safely, limiting his interaction with voters, in contrast to Trump's super spreader events. He deserves praise for that.

Trump also benefited from his false claims that Biden is a socialist, which gave him a huge boost with many voters, pivotally in Florida , where many have roots in countries devastated by socialist regimes.

Trump also exploited racism and xenophobia, one of the ugliest aspects of his presidency and his campaign.

But the millions who voted for Trump were not all gullible or racist. Yes, Trump undoubtedly won the racist vote, the homophobic vote, the xenophobic vote. But tens of millions of Americans have seen and heard something else from Trump that appeals to them. We should make an effort to understand what that is.

Trump has charisma. He portrays himself as a tough defender of America and, in particular, of blue collar and rural Americans. The issues on which he promises to fight for the people are worth noting. Ignore for a moment what he has done, and listen to what he has promised, what he said that resonated with voters -- except for the racist parts.

In 2016, Trump tapped into a sense of anguish in areas of the economy that were shrinking. He promised to go after America's trade partners who, he claimed, were taking advantage of the United States. This caught voters' attention because there are big sectors of the US economy that have been bulldozed by the global economy.

Manufacturing has been all but uprooted and replanted in China; coal has been crushed by valid environmental concerns, and job security for millions of workers has been vanishing as the gig economy ascends -- offering meager compensation, instead of solid jobs with benefits and job security. We've all met Uber drivers struggling to make ends meet after losing a good job.

At the same time -- and evident in the election results -- the divide between urban and rural America has been growing starker. Rural, more conservative voters are deeply uncomfortable with some of the social and cultural changes in the country.

Democrats would do well to delve into these issues and try to learn from the concerns of Trump voters. Anguish and fear of economic dislocation predated the pandemic. This has to do with long-term changes in the economy, not this temporary crisis.

And fear of what the crowds in the cities stand for predates Trump's ugly, dog-whistle claims that Democrats would destroy the suburbs.

The country desperately needs to come together for common objectives. That requires respecting each other's views, making an effort to understand, explain, and try to bridge the gap, and finding ways to address the legitimate concerns of people with whom you disagree.

Certain items are not negotiable, obviously. Racism and prejudice are intolerable. But I don't think those are the principal motivations behind most of the support for Trump.

Many Americans want a strong president, one who will take up the fight for them at home and abroad. Whether or not Trump has done that is immaterial at this stage. The country is in dire straits. If Americans can work together, they will find solutions much faster. Staying at war with each other will only prolong the struggle."
Can Trump decide when to stop counting votes? (opinion),['Opinion Elie Honig'],"Elie Honig is a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers' questions on ""CNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera"" on weekends.

(CNN) President Donald Trump declared early Wednesday morning that ""we'll be going to the US Supreme Court,"" and ""we want all voting to stop."" Trump's statements oversimplify and misconceive how elections work and how the courts function.

First things first: Article II of the Constitution specifically gives the states the right to administer their own presidential elections: ""Each state shall appoint, in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct"" its presidential electors. We do not have one unified, national election system; we have 51 separate and different systems (one for each state plus the District of Columbia), each with its own set of rules and procedures.

Indeed, federal law creates a deadline known as the "" safe harbor "" period -- this year, 35 days, until December 8 -- which gives states time to complete their vote-counting and certification processes. Congress must accept any state results certified by that date. Within that safe harbor period, each state has its own rules and deadlines about when mail-in ballots must arrive in order to be counted and when it must certify its election results, among other things. Twenty-two states plus Washington DC permit ballots that arrive after November 3 -- but are postmarked on or before Election Day -- to be counted.

Pennsylvania is one of those states (it's technically a ""commonwealth"") and is the most likely legal battleground on the issue of vote-counting post-Election Day -- though the possibility of the election ultimately being decided in the courts is remote. The Pennsylvania legislature passed a law in 2019 permitting mail-in voting and requiring that those ballots must be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to be counted. In September 2020, however, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that, given the extraordinary circumstances presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, mail-in ballots can be counted if they are postmarked by 8 p.m. on November 3 and arrive at county boards of election by 5 p.m. on November 6.

The losing party in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court -- the Pennsylvania Republican Party -- then tried to bring the case to the US Supreme Court. But the court declined to stay (meaning, essentially, put on hold) the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's ruling. The US Supreme Court split 4-4, with Chief Justice John Roberts joining Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan in voting against the stay and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh voting for it. Given the tie vote, the motion for a stay did not succeed, and the lower court opinion from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court remained intact.

But the Pennsylvania Republican Party tried again. This time, it used a different procedural mechanism, requesting that the US Supreme Court grant certiorari (review of the merits of the case) on an expedited (sped-up) basis. The court again denied that application . Five justices voted to deny the application but three justices -- Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch -- filed a dissenting opinion arguing that the court should have considered the case and should have struck down the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's extension of the deadline because the original law passed by the Pennsylvania legislature specified the deadline to be 8 p.m. on Election Day. (Justice Amy Coney Barrett did not participate in the ruling because she had just joined the court days prior).

Here's where the potential issues arise. While the US Supreme Court declined to take the Pennsylvania case on an expedited basis, it made clear that the case remains before it for potential consideration on the merits. And, in his dissenting opinion, Gorsuch noted that the Pennsylvania attorney general had certified that mail-in ballots received after 8 p.m. on November 3 but before 5 p.m. on November 6 would be "" segregated "" -- separated -- from other mail-in ballots. That means, as a practical matter, that if the Supreme Court does take up the issue after the Pennsylvania vote count is completed, it will have the ability to essentially disqualify those votes that arrived after 8 p.m. on November 3.

That's the most likely avenue for the Trump campaign to seek and obtain relief in the courts. If the election comes down to Pennsylvania and if the count is close enough that mail-in ballots arriving after the original deadline on November 3 but before the extended deadline of November 6 could swing the outcome -- two very big ""ifs"" -- then we could see a make-or-break battle in the Supreme Court.

Three justices (Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch) already have made clear they believe that votes arriving after the original deadline should be disqualified. Kavanaugh did not join that dissenting opinion but he went out of his way in another recent decision on Wisconsin ballots to note that ""(i)f the apparent winner the morning after the election ends up losing due to late-arriving ballots, charges of a rigged election could explode."" And Barrett, a staunch conservative nominated by Trump, could choose to vote on the case. There have been calls for Barrett to recuse herself from election-related cases, but that decision rests entirely with Barrett herself, and there is no way for any outside party to compel her to recuse.

Beyond Pennsylvania, the Trump campaign faces major procedural obstacles to challenge election results in other states. First, no party can take a case directly to the Supreme Court unless the case involves a dispute between two states or involves an ambassador (neither exception is applicable here). So, any election case would first need to go through either a state court system (as in the Pennsylvania dispute) or the lower federal courts. And no party can ever compel the Supreme Court to grant certiorari (meaning to take the case for consideration). Only the Supreme Court itself can decide to take a case, if at least four justices vote to do so.

Trump was dangerously off base with his proclamation. He cannot unilaterally take a case to the Supreme Court, and he lacks any basis to make the voting stop. But the Supreme Court has left the door open just a crack to the possibility that it could step in and disqualify certain mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania. If the election comes down to Pennsylvania -- and specifically those votes arriving after election night -- then we could end up seeing the election decided in the Supreme Court."

(CNN) There is a reason CNN has been warning to expect ""Election Week"" rather than ""Election Night.""

America is living it right now. And that's why we all need to stay calm and count every vote.

The sun rose after Election Day on a country still deeply divided -- with President Donald Trump outperforming polls and securing Florida's prized 29 electoral votes early in the night.

But the fundamental facts of the 2020 campaign remain in place. This is a Coronavirus Election -- and that means states are still processing an unprecedented number of mail-in ballots.

The 2020 presidential race is far from over. Either Biden or Trump could still win -- though Democrats have reason to believe that the outstanding mail-in ballots in major population centers would disproportionately favor their candidate. Republicans have reason to feel confident because they upended the polls and expectations, making inroads to the Hispanic population in particular -- and they appear to have stopped momentum for a Democratic Senate pick-up spree, despite some Democratic gains. But all of this is hypothetical until all the ballots cast are counted.

JUST WATCHED Ana Navarro: They certainly fooled pollsters again Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Ana Navarro: They certainly fooled pollsters again 01:35

Joe Biden is leading in the popular vote, as expected, and as of 8:30 a.m. on November 4 there are nine states which have not been called because they are still counting votes -- From Alaska to Nevada and Arizona in the West to Wisconsin and Michigan in the Upper Midwest, to East Coast states from Georgia to North Carolina to Pennsylvania and Maine.

Not all these states will break one way, but in many of them, the bulk of the outstanding votes are mail-in ballots from major population centers -- big cities, small metros and suburbs -- where Democrats are expected to have an edge . In general, the mail-in votes cast have shown a decided tilt toward Democrats.

But Democrats aren't guaranteed a win in situations like this. In 2018, two Florida statewide races were too close to call -- prompting Trump to tweet : ""An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!"" Republicans won those seats when all the outstanding ballots were counted.

Now, President Trump is reverting to his autocratic instincts, falsely declaring , ""Frankly, we did win this election"" and stating that he wanted to go to the Supreme Court with his insistence that ""we want all voting to stop.""

Don't get numb to how dangerous, dictatorial and fundamentally unlawful Trump's demand is. Even Trump ally Chris Christie condemned the comments, saying , ""There's just no basis to make that argument tonight. There just isn't. All these votes have to be counted that are in now.""

Thankfully, we are still a nation of laws, though Team Trump will, as they have indicated for weeks, challenge the outstanding ballots in court and claim that the full counting of votes is evidence of Democrats trying to ""manipulate the results"" and ""steal the election"" -- as they already did in a post-election tweet

That is the opposite of true -- any attempt to stop the full and fair counting of ballots would be more credibly characterized as an attempt to ""steal"" the election. Counting all the ballots is not fraud. Outstanding questions remain about why the US Postal Service, run by a Trump mega-donor, defied a court order to account for 300,000 missing ballots, amid accusations of a slowdown in delivery.

That's why we are still in the middle of election week in an instant gratification society that is unaccustomed to waiting for the process to work. The heightened emotions are understandable -- there is a lot at stake -- and many Democrats were expecting a battleground state blowout that decidedly did not materialize. We may have the third presidential election this century where the winner of the popular vote does not win the electoral college, benefiting the Republican, which would be lawful but deeply destabilizing. We may see a decisive though narrower than expected Democratic win in both the popular and electoral vote.

The election has yet to be decided and we may not know who won for days or even weeks. But, as of this writing, it seems investors are pricing in a Joe Biden presidency and a split Congress, where Republicans continue to control the Senate and Democrats the House.

Stock prices are up big on the election news, and long-term interest rates are down big. The reaction in financial markets to the election is telling us a lot about what investors think it all means for the economy.

Most immediately, investors appear to be betting that the election results will be settled in the next few days at most and that worries about vote counts being seriously contested and ultimately dragged all the way to the Supreme Court weeks from now are misplaced. The race is close, but not close enough to credibly argue that cheating changed the outcome.

Stock investors also appear cheered by the prospects for a split government that will make big changes to economic policy more difficult. Getting any major legislation into law won't be easy. Remember President Obama's second term? It seemed as if he was constantly doing political battle with a Republican Senate. As a result, not much economic policy of consequence got done.

That's good news to shareholders who are wary of Biden's proposal to increase taxes on corporations, which would mean businesses will have less cash to pay dividends and make share repurchases. Investors may also be doing some handwringing over Biden's desire to increase the federal minimum wage , another campaign proposal that likely won't happen if he comes into office with a Republican-led Senate."
Who is winning the nail biter election? Commentary on election night returns (opinion),[],"(CNN) Opinion contributors weigh in on Election Night results as CNN makes projections throughout the night. The views expressed in this commentary are those of the writers.

Paul Begala: Keep calm and count on

As of this writing, Joe Biden is leading in Electoral College, 227-213 . He is leading in the popular vote. Biden is ahead in the too early to call states of Nevada (which Hillary Clinton won in 2016 ), Arizona, Wisconsin and Michigan (which President Donald Trump won in 2016 ). Trump leads in the other too early to call states Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia.

Close elections are not unusual. Everyone old enough to remember George W. Bush versus Al Gore in 2000 knows that. Florida, home to millions of Americans, went to Bush by just 537 votes. That makes both Biden's and Trump's narrow leads in various states look like a landslide by comparison.

Democrats have understandable confidence. That's why they want all the votes counted. (For a reasoned, rational Democratic perspective on Pennsylvania, I highly recommend the Twitter feed of Sen. Bob Casey Jr. Armed with a map and a Mister Rogers sweater, he walks you through the Keystone State.)

Trump, on the other hand, has sailed past worried and crashed onto the shoals of panic. His disgraceful late-night rant in the White House revealed a weak and frightened man. What a contrast to Joe Biden, who looked strong and certain in his late-night remarks.

What happens next? If Mr. Biden's lead holds and he crosses 270 electoral votes in the final tally (which I believe will happen), Mr. Trump will graciously concede and offer complete cooperation in the smoothest, greatest, bestest transition ever. Kidding. More likely, if history is any guide, he will rant, he will spin wild conspiracy theories, he will incite, he will sue. His theme song may well be the old Warren Zevon classic ""Lawyers, Guns and Money."" Biden's motto should be: ""Keep Calm and Count On.""

The votes will be counted. The lawsuits will fail. The fringe agitators will fizzle out. And hopefully on January 20, a grateful nation will breathe a sigh of relief and begin the process of healing and reuniting.

Joe Lockhart: Trump baselessly charged fraud

Joe Lockhart

You have to give President Trump credit for being consistent. Since taking office he's shattered every norm of our nation's capital. So tonight, no one should be surprised that the American tradition of waiting until the votes are counted has been upended by a Tweet and speech in the East Room of the White House.

After four years of Trump, it's easy to be numb and say it's just a tweet, or it's just another over-the-top statement. But that is not the case here. What Trump is doing tonight is directly discounting millions of votes that were legally cast over the last month.

I have no doubt Secretaries of State can handle counting the votes. What worries governors and mayors across the country is whether they can handle Trump voters who will be whipped up by the President over the next few days. He is sending a direct message to his supporters that counting anymore votes is akin to stealing the election from them. Remember, Trump supporters allegedly tried to run a Biden bus off the road a few days. Imagine what they might do if they are being told the President the election is being stolen from them.

This will be a test for the country. I have no doubt our nation can wait until a few days until all the votes are counted. I also have no doubt the President will do whatever he can both using his platform and a legion of lawyers to stop the legally cast ballots from being counted.

The worst case scenario discussed over the last few months may have just had its short fuse lit by President Trump. This will be a very difficult week for our country and our Democracy -- and the ultimate outcome is impossible to predict.

Sarah Isgur: What we know so far

Sarah Isgur

Two takeaways so far:

First, the old Republican party of limited government and fiscal discipline is officially dead. There was no repudiation of Donald Trump -- neither his character nor his policies -- tonight. In fact, one of the biggest takeaways is that, but for the pandemic, it seems very likely that Trump would have been easily reelected with a pre-March economy.

Many Republican Senate candidates appear to have been reelected on the President's coattails. Both parties will focus on what this realignment means as it will have dramatic effects on future candidate recruitment efforts and almost certainly ends the conversation around the kinds of sweeping changes Democrats were hoping for, such as adding justices to the Supreme Court.

Second, for the first time in modern history, we were able to study the outcome of two asymmetrical campaign strategies. Both campaigns focused on turning out their voters, but despite raising more money than the Trump campaign, the Biden campaign spent almost none of it on a traditional ground game. If Biden loses -- and even if he wins -- we may have just learned a valuable lesson about the importance of voter registration drives and door knocking programs.

Shan Wu: Trump could cause legal havoc with election

Shanlon Wu

President Trump just declared war on the 2020 Presidential election in his 2 a.m. press conference. With major battle ground states still counting votes, Trump claimed that he had already won the election and promised to be sending lawyers to ask the United States Supreme Court to intervene.

Legally, there is no mechanism for Trump to go directly to the Supreme Court. His lawyers need to first go through a trial court, then appeal to a court of appeal if they lose and then get the Supreme Court to take the ""case."" What exactly would be the case? Hard to say, but it would come in the form of some kind of injunction directed at states where Trump is ahead but early voting and absentee ballots are still being counted. Could this legal strategy succeed?

Conventional legal analysis would say such a ploy has zero merit. But here is the danger: Trump and the Federalist Society have packed the federal judiciary with some 220 judges and the Supreme Court with a 6-3 Conservative majority. He needs only one federal district judge to side with him and enter an injunction of some kind. That creates a ""case"" that Trump lawyers can begin to pursue through an expedited appeal process—and for which they can seek expedited relief before the Supreme Court.

Trump does not need to succeed on a national basis -- he must only succeed in the number of states he needs to maintain his margin as of the end of November 3. And he has one secret weapon yet to deploy. That weapon is Attorney General Bill Barr who has been notably silent in the run-up to the election.

It would be unprecedented for the US Department of Justice to seek to intervene in an election. But let's remember this is the same Department of Justice that Barr ordered to intervene in a state defamation case by arguing that the President's denial of an alleged rape was part of his official duties. With this kind of federal judiciary and this kind of attorney general, it just isn't possible to predict the legal havoc that Trump may wreak.

Van Jones: Democrats lost a moral victory on Election Night

Van Jones

I think a lot of Democrats are hurting tonight.

There's the moral victory, and there's the political victory. They are not the same. The Democratic political victory might still come. But I believe people wanted a moral victory tonight.

Under the Trump administration we've witnessed children getting snatched away from their mothers at the border -- several hundred of whom have yet to be reunited with their parents. Parents are sending their kids into schools where the N-word is being used against them. And there is a wave of intolerance that, quite frankly, is intolerable.

People got their hopes up looking at those polls showing Joe Biden had a solid lead over Donald Trump. We wanted to see a repudiation of Trump's direction for the country. The reality that this election is this close just hurts.

The political victory is still possible. We still have to wait on final results in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Georgia and Arizona.

But I have to be honest -- there were people hoping for a big repudiation in this election and that has not yet come. And because of that, a lot of people are hurt and scared tonight in the Democratic Party.

Roxanne Jones: Cori Bush's historic victory is more than a win for Black Americans

Roxanne Jones

Cori Bush has been proclaiming Black Lives Matter since she joined street protests to demand justice after the tragic 2014 police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Now, it seems, her voice has finally been heard as she appears poised to become Missouri's first Black congresswoman, with CNN projecting her as the winner after 88% of the state's returns showed she had captured almost 80% of the vote.

For now, Bush is taking the win, tweeting a photo of herself standing beneath a painting of Shirley Chisholm (the first Black woman elected to Congress), captioned ""The First.""

Bush, who was backed by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY), is now set to join progressive voices gaining prominence and power in the Democratic Party. A registered nurse, she backs the Green New Deal, Medicare for All and ending mass incarceration

Bush's message of social justice resonated beyond Missouri.

Nationwide, according to CNN exit polls, one-third of voters who back Joe Biden said racial inequality was their most important issue going into the election. For Donald Trump voters, the economy was the top issue.

For me, Bush's historic win is much more than a win for Black Americans. It is a win for the America that I want to see.

Keith Boykin: The election should never have been this close

Keith Boykin

I don't know who will win the 2020 presidential election, but the issue that most concerns me is that the race is close at all.

But according to CNN exit polls , 57% of white voters still cast their ballots for Trump. All other racial and ethnic demographic groups supported former Vice President Joe Biden.

It's not surprising that a Republican presidential candidate would win the majority of the White vote. Every GOP nominee has done so since 1964 . What is disturbing, but also not surprising, is that so many White voters -- after years of watching Black and Brown Americans complain about Trump's racism -- still chose to vote for him.

Sarah Lenti: Coloradans recognized the deep flaws in Trumpism

Sarah Lenti

Colorado has long been known as a purple state. It's clear why when looking at the party registration of voters who returned ballots in the 2020 election. Around 29% of ballots came from registered Republicans, about 31% from registered Democrats, and just under 40% from unaffiliated voters. And yet the Centennial State delivered decisive victories to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and Democratic Senate candidate John Hickenlooper.

Put another way, we did not see a partisan tidal wave in Colorado, despite two Democrats winning with substantial majorities. Independent-minded voters who would prefer not to be labeled by either party played a key role in this outcome.

It seems voters in Colorado took issue with President Donald Trump's performance over the last four years. Perhaps his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic was the deciding factor for many voters, given that Colorado Governor Jared Polis emphasized the importance of taking public health measures seriously. In contrast, President Trump was briefed about Covid-19 at the end of January, but he didn't declare a national emergency until March 13th. In the over seven months since then, we've watched the novel coronavirus rip through the country while Trump failed to lead the nation in a coordinated fight against the pandemic.

The fact that the incumbent Republican Sen. Cory Gardner endorsed Trump in January 2019, was reason enough for a purple state to vote him out, narrowing the Republican majority in the Senate.

Coloradans aren't fools and our voters proved that by decisively rejecting Trump and Trumpism. It seems Colorado is ready to heal from the chaos and destruction Trump has sowed. Is the rest of the country?

Julian E. Zelizer: It's close, and not a decisive verdict

Julian Zelizer

It's clear that this is a close election. All eyes are turned back to the same states that mattered so much in 2016—Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a handful of other competitive battlegrounds. In other states it might take many hours, if not days, before everything is counted.

Some Democrats were hoping for an Election Night that ended early. There was speculation in the air that big game-changers could be on the table, like Georgia (which is not yet decided), and Texas--which ended up going to Trump

But as the evening progressed, Biden's lead in some states started to narrow. Trump gradually moved ahead in Florida, and soon took the delegate-rich Sunshine State off the table for Democrats. In other states, where Biden's early numbers were good, such as Ohio and North Carolina, the lead also narrowed. He lost Ohio.

The drama of the last four years now meets the reality of a politically polarized electorate and an Electoral College system, a combination that has left us with elections usually determined at the margins, with a handful of voters in a handful of states determining the outcome. While we constantly imagine the possibility of another landslide, akin to LBJ's victory in 1964 against Senator Barry Goldwater or President Ronald Reagan's triumph over Minnesota's Walter Mondale in 1984, the fault lines of America create an electoral map that is rigid.

This is what allows a president who has been as unpopular and divisive as President Donald Trump to still retain a path to victory as the night progresses. It is also the reason that whoever wins, he will enter into an incredibly rough political terrain, since a sizable part of the electorate won't be on board with the new administration.

It is still too early to know where the election will end up. But we can see--as we saw in 2016--that we live in a nation where the divisions are so immense that even a president as controversial as our current commander in chief doesn't transform the map as dramatically as we might think.

Charlie Dent: We have to be patient on Pennsylvania

Charlie Dent

The election outcome in Pennsylvania remains inconclusive. CNN reports that at least 1.4 million ballots have yet to be counted. It was expected that mail-in — actually, no-excuse absentee ballots -- could take days to be counted. Remember that Pennsylvania has never done this volume of absentee voting. In fact, the Pennsylvania General Assembly authorized no excuse absentee voting prior to the pandemic, which has caused a dramatic increase in the volume of voting by mail.

Patience is the order of the moment. Donald Trump had a lead of around 600,000 votes around 3 a.m. Wednesday, but that lead could substantially diminish or disappear as the remaining votes are counted. Nothing is fixed or fraudulent, there's just a need to count the lawfully cast votes and no reason to disenfranchise anyone who participated legally and in good faith. Let the process play out and the chips fall where they may.

This is no time for Donald Trump to declare victory or suggest the American democratic process is rigged and unfair. President Trump won Pennsylvania by 44,000 votes in 2016 , and he may win the Commonwealth yet again.

No one knows what the outcome will be, but it could wind up to be a close race.

Laura Belin: Iowa shows high turnout can be good for Republicans too

Laura Belin

Last year, few pundits would have expected Republican Sen. Joni Ernst to face a tough re-election campaign. The last time Iowans voted out a sitting US senator was back in 1984. But more recent opinion polls pointed to a tight race, with Ernst often trailing Democratic challenger Theresa Greenfield.

Ernst won her first Senate race in 2014 after a relatively low turnout.

It's long been an axiom that ""when people vote, Democrats win,"" and Democrats had high hopes ahead of Election Day given the strong early voting numbers

Iowans did come out to vote in huge numbers this year. But the surge wasn't limited to large, Democratic-leaning counties. While Ernst slightly underperformed President Donald Trump's vote share (winning 51.7%, compared to 52.6%. for the President, with about 92% of the vote counted), she still won the Senate race by more than 107,600 votes.

Not only did she run up the numbers in traditionally Republican rural areas, she carried places like Wapello, Webster and Jasper counties, which have smaller cities that used to lean blue, and won with even larger margins in those counties than she did in 2014.

It was a mistake to think high turnout would help Democrats in Iowa.

Chris King: Democrats face a serious problem in South Florida

Chris King

Tonight, President Donald Trump won Florida. At this point, the presidential race has yet to be decided and the results will ultimately hinge on a handful of battleground states. But for progressive Floridians like myself who have spent the evening making calls to wonderful candidates from Miami to Tampa to Central Florida who lost tough races, we cannot shy away from the facts in front of us.

Democrats vastly underperformed in Florida, and we have a real problem to fix.

It's clear that Trump brings out big crowds in rural areas and runs up significant margins in Florida's panhandle. What poses an existential threat to the Democratic party is South Florida -- particularly Miami-Dade County -- where Biden lost significant ground compared with former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who won the county with a 30-point lead over Trump in 2016.

Trump, who repeatedly accused the Democratic Party of being run by socialists, made inroads among Latinos, specifically Cuban Americans, who historically lean Republican. The socialism label isn't fair, but its association, real or imagined, is toxic to Democrats' chances at winning elections in Florida. Going forward, Florida Democrats must unabashedly celebrate entrepreneurship, small business creation and creative capitalism in all its forms or continue to suffer the same results we saw tonight.

James Moore: Why Texas was still out of reach for Dems

James Moore

Democrats were hopeful. But most were privately realistic: It was too soon to go blue. Vice President Joe Biden would have had to have been bigger than football -- and barbecue -- but he wasn't. And he was Democratic Senate candidate MJ Hegar's best chance to beat the incumbent Republican Sen. John Cornyn. Her chances looked good, but she needed long coattails from Biden. She's a war hero who rode Harleys and sounded fearless. Though she got a lot of money from the national party as well as small donors, she still fell short with key constituencies.

Hegar failed to ask for the help of a popular African American state senator she had defeated in the primary, which appears to have hurt her with Black voters. Her message -- I'm not Cornyn and I'm tough -- wasn't enough. Too many voters didn't know what they'd get if they voted for Hegar. But they knew what Trump offered, and many wanted it.

Democrats remain aspirational. Time and demographics look good for them. One out of every five voters in this election were newly registered, yet Republicans still maintain a historical advantage. While the race was, at a minimum, competitive, competing is a poor substitution for winning. And waiting.

Issac Bailey: By re-electing Lindsey Graham, South Carolina voters gave politicians a license to lie

Issac Bailey

""I want you to use my words against me. If there's a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say Lindsey Graham said, 'Let's let the next president, whoever it might be, make that nomination,"" he said back then.

Then in September of this election year, and less than a day after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death, Graham tweeted, ""I will support President @realDonaldTrump in any effort to move forward regarding the recent vacancy created by the passing of Justice Ginsburg.""

And just over a week ago, Graham--the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee--pushed through a vote to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, as millions of voters around the country were casting their ballots in the 2020 election, a complete about-face from his stance just four years ago.

In the end, too many voters did not use his words against him, like he asked the people to do. His re-election means a majority here just doesn't care about integrity, doesn't care if Graham views them as so hyperpartisan that he can do just about anything short of, say, shooting someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose support, like President Donald Trump once marveled—about himself.

Voters have given politicians like Graham the greenlight to spit upon us whenever the mood strikes, whenever their thirst for power becomes their priority. No matter what else happens during this election cycle, that will long be a blight on a state supposedly on the buckle of the Bible Belt -- one thatonce believed character mattered for those chosen to represent us.

Apparently, those were empty words. It wasn't a principle, just a politically-convenient position to use against hated opponents. Graham lied to our face on an issue that has sparked a crisis in our judiciary system. And not enough of us cared. Shame on us."

Opinion: Dr. Deborah Birx's stern warning is a wakeup call,['Opinion Jill Filipovic'],"Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book ""OK Boomer, Let's Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind."" Follow her on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) Dr. Deborah Birx has a dire warning for Americans: The Covid-19 pandemic is going to get much, much worse before it gets any better. And there's one clear takeaway from her warnings: whatever happens on election day, we're largely on our own. It's up to us to keep the number of Covid-19 infections as low as possible as we head into a difficult season that will last far beyond the results of the 2020 election.

Jill Filipovic

According to the Washington Post, Birx, one of the White House's most senior coronavirus advisers, issued her warning in an internal memo on November 2, saying that ""We are entering the most concerning and most deadly phase of this pandemic ... leading to increasing mortality."" And the White House, she wrote, is not doing enough: ""This is not about lockdowns -- it hasn't been about lockdowns since March or April. It's about an aggressive balanced approach that is not being implemented.""

The President has been singing a different tune. Just days before the election, Donald Trump repeated a claim he made during the last presidential debate and told Iowans that the United States was ""rounding the corner"" on the pandemic. He has been holding huge campaign rallies in direct violation of public health guidelines advising against large gatherings. He is typically seen in public without a mask, refusing to model the kind of behavior that helps to keep the virus from spreading and saves lives.

Americans should heed Birx's warnings -- and not emulate the President's recklessness. Birx warns that the US could see more than 100,000 new cases per day this week. As people get sicker and hospitals fill up, we could see a return to the dire situation from the spring, when hospitals were beyond capacity and doctors were talking about rationing ventilators. And like in the spring, Europe is a harbinger of what's to come -- they're already seeing soaring infection rates , prompting more lockdowns and emergency measures.

This next wave of the pandemic will be fueled by a perfect storm. As temperatures drop, the outdoor gatherings that sustained so many of our social lives through the summer will become increasingly untenable. Many cities and states have relaxed their rules, allowing indoor dining again and sending some people back into the office. The holidays are coming up, with American families typically gathering indoors for Thanksgiving at the end of the month; Christmas is just a month after that, followed by the revelry of New Years Eve. And many of us are experiencing a kind of Covid fatigue, letting down our guards and underestimating our risk

It can be a useful, if hackneyed political promise, often delivered with great gusto and sanctimony.

It's made every year, usually by the candidates themselves. But, by countless metrics, it isn't always true.

Certain elections stand out more than others. After all, we've voted in times of war, both civil and external. We've voted in times of economic depression and collapse. We've voted in times of national tragedies.

This year, 2020, is, by those standards, not one of those times. It is not 1860, when America was facing a Civil War and the potential demise of the Union; or 1932, against the backdrop of the Great Depression; or 1964, after the assassination of John F. Kennedy Jr.

And yet, because of both national circumstances and popular sentiment, it feels as though that statement has never been truer.

Because of the global Covid-19 pandemic economic uncertainty , racial and civil unrest around the country, a Supreme Court vacancy, two presidential candidates with very different views of what America should look like and a populace that's more divided than ever, it's not surprising that more voters say it ""really matters"" who wins the presidency than at any point in the last two decades, according to Pew Research

And perhaps because 2016 and President Donald Trump brought such a noticeable disruption to American politics -- in ways that were both intended and celebrated by his base, and lamented by his detractors -- it feels like what happens next will have another seismic impact.

But what will that look like?

A Biden victory wouldn't be a magical turning point

There's a sense on the left that a Joe Biden victory in November would bring about some kind of immediate and lasting relief, an end to the Trump era of anger, rancor, division and bigotry.

That could certainly be true where Biden himself is concerned. Since he has gotten into the race, he's been promising to bring the country together, to heal and unite us.

""It's time we come together,"" Biden tweeted on October 3. ""It's time we see each other as fellow Americans, who don't just live in red states and blue states, but who live in -- and love -- the United States of America. That's who we are -- and there is nothing we cannot do if we do it together.""

For many of us, that sounds like a tidy and deeply reassuring encapsulation of everything that could be -- and that must be after four years of Trump.

But November 3 is not a magical turning point where a Biden win makes all our problems disappear. His promise of unity may be well-intentioned and sincere, but there are seemingly insurmountable political, cultural and practical barriers to delivering on that promise. And as we all focus our energy on getting to the election itself, we haven't yet begun to scratch the surface of what comes next for whomever is elected -- and for America herself.

For starters, if Biden wins in November, how, exactly, do we come together when nearly half the electorate who didn't vote for Biden is left disappointed, angry and, if Trump has his way, maybe even believing the election was somehow rigged against them?

How does Biden move past a defeated president who may not admit defeat? Or, if he does, who will still carry an enormous clout among his base of voters? How does Biden attempt to appeal to these voters who felt so aggrieved by American politics that they voted for Trump not once but twice?

How does Biden begin to heal racial tensions when some factions on the left and the right, among Whites and Blacks , find him to be a problematic arbiter of race relations?

How does he pass any of his legislative promises if Congress remains divided? How does he find compromise opportunities with Republicans, as he's expressed interest in doing, when his own party may insist on pulling him leftward?

How does he combat a Covid-19 culture clash over everything from vaccines to mask-wearing when some Americans refuse to trust science and medical experts?

In short, how does he bring together a country that may not want to come together?

A Trump victory raises equally meaningful questions

Conversely, those questions are different but just as meaningful if Trump wins a second term. Will he double down on four years of division? What will that mean for the very real problems he and Congress will have to tackle, especially if the GOP loses control of the Senate? How will the electorate respond?

How do we end the violence in major cities over racial injustice and police brutality? How do we combat Covid when the White House undermines the science? How do we fortify the checks and balances that Congress and the Justice Department have systemically weakened?

No matter what happens in November, what comes next?

It's an overwhelmingly complicated, loaded question if ever there were one, and it's where we want to start a series of conversations.

The systemic and institutional problems America is grappling with will not be resolved in November with an election or January with an inauguration. They may not be resolved within the next year or four. And the way forward is remarkably unclear.

From race to criminal justice, immigration to gun violence, reproductive rights to LGBTQ rights, tax policy to trade policy, education to climate change, Russia to China, a distrust of science to a distrust of news -- it's imperative that we start having conversations now about tackling these issues that go beyond talking points and political slogans.

Each week CNN Opinion will feature an essay by an expert voice outlining how we can move ahead on one of these crucial problems facing America. Following that essay, I'll host other expert voices to engage in a larger conversation, which you can watch on CNN Digital, about tackling those problems in real ways, that don't gloss over the cultural, social, political and economic barriers either administration would inevitably encounter.

Here, two former public officials -- Sylvia Mathews Burwell and Frances Fragos Townsend -- come together to tell us what should come next.

Despite the deep divisions ravaging our country ahead of the presidential elections, many Americans are looking for answers to a common threat -- the coronavirus. As the daily number of cases and deaths have risen, we remain in the throes of a pandemic that has killed more than 225,000 of our fellow citizens and torpedoed our economy. Indeed, the US is averaging more than 68,000 new cases a day.

Regardless of whether Trump or Joe Biden wins the election, though, the next president will confront a dual challenge: managing the current pandemic and ensuring that the country and the world are better prepared when the next plague strikes -- as it inevitably will.

It is past time for the nation to make the investments we need to prevent, detect and respond quickly to emerging infectious diseases, like the coronavirus, before they sicken Americans and force catastrophic economic shutdowns. That is the main finding of a bipartisan task force sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), which we were honored to chair.

Here at home, three of the most glaring failures relate to testing, science-based communication and the protection of vulnerable populations.

Nothing has undercut the US response to Covid-19 more than the failure to develop -- to this day -- a comprehensive nationwide system of testing and tracing that allows public health authorities to rapidly identify infected individuals and their contacts in order to isolate the sick from healthy populations. Without this timely information, authorities are too often flying blind, uncertain of the trajectory of the disease, slow to identify hot spots and unable to stop the spread of the virus through targeted measures that do not require shutting down entire communities and economies.

The US experience on testing and contact tracing stands in contrast to nations like South Korea , which rapidly ramped up nationwide testing and successfully mobilized an army of contact tracers. The US cannot put itself in this position again.

The success of public health measures like contact tracing, mask-wearing, and social distancing depends on individuals and communities trusting and adhering to advice from medical professionals and scientists, sometimes delivered by elected and other officials. That public trust must be earned and sustained.

Elected US officials, including the President, often have fallen short as communicators in this pandemic. To prevent future pandemics from becoming a political football, public officials at all levels, from the White House to city halls, should put physicians, scientists and other public health professionals front and center in public briefings, starting from onset of the crisis. This will improve consistency in communication and help establish and maintain public trust in containment measures.

We also need to do better by our most vulnerable citizens. The pandemic has taken a grievous toll on the elderly and nursing home residents specifically. It has also hit essential workers hard , and Black, Latino, Native and low-income Americans suffer disproportionately . As of the end of September, according to the Atlantic, Black Americans have died from Covid-19 at 2.3 times the rate of White Americans, comprising 21% of all US deaths from the disease -- and this despite making up approximately 13% of the US population. Despite these disparities, weeks passed before many states recognized and began reporting disaggregated data monitoring the issue.

Going forward, state and local health agencies should collect and publicly report data by age, race, gender and other relevant socio-demographic status. Armed with better data, US government authorities at all levels should target public health investments to increase the resilience of these communities, including universal paid sick leave in declared pandemics, accessible and free testing, and workplace protections and personal protective equipment for essential workers. Social justice and equity in our existing health care system is not just a moral mandate -- it is a matter of basic pandemic preparedness.

But the US cannot wall itself off from pandemic threats with domestic preparedness alone. As the Nobel Laureate Joshua Lederberg once aptly wrote , ""The microbe that felled one child in a distant continent yesterday can reach yours today and seed a global pandemic tomorrow.""

The CFR report identifies multiple flaws in existing global health security arrangements, including the World Health Organization (WHO). It also takes China to task for its lack of transparency, which enabled the novel coronavirus to gather momentum following the initial outbreak in Wuhan. At the same time, it is not in America's interests to leave the WHO in the midst of a pandemic or to allow its understandable frustration with China to impede global collaboration.

The smarter choice is to reform and strengthen the WHO as an essential cornerstone of global pandemic preparedness. Over the years, member states have saddled that agency with expanding tasks without providing it with the adequate resources or authorities to mobilize an effective pandemic response. The next president needs to change that dynamic.

The coronavirus demonstrates that an international framework for pandemic detection and response that relies so heavily on the transparency, judgment and discretion of individual national governments leaves too many opportunities for failure. We need to improve the detection and assessment of epidemic threats through the creation of an international, hospital-based surveillance network. Alerts from that network should, in turn, notify national public health agencies and the WHO -- and trigger an international response.

It would also benefit the US to form a coalition of like-minded states, that would also engage civil society and the private sector to surmount the geopolitical gridlock that has undermined effective pandemic preparedness and response. The US should spearhead the creation of this coalition of interested members of the G-7 and G-20 nations to facilitate cooperation on practical security and economic matters, such as shortages of medical supplies and foreign assistance to struggling economies.

Finally, the next president must resist the siren song of vaccine nationalism. With a pandemic in full swing, there is a natural temptation to try to reserve limited supplies of any effective vaccine for one's own country and citizens. But doing so does not serve our health or national security interests and could leave us in a difficult situation if a US company is not the first to develop an effective vaccine.

So far, the US has chosen not to join COVAX , a groundbreaking consortium of more than 150 countries created not only to develop a vaccine but to ensure that when one emerges it is shared equitably, rather than hoarded by individual countries. We hope that the next president -- whoever he may be -- will reconsider this decision.

When it comes to pandemics, we all sink or swim together, from each individual citizen, to each city, state and nation. We are in it together, and that will require America's commitment and action to prevent the spread of another deadly and infectious disease."
Mandy Patinkin: How I became political -- and why you should too,['Opinion Mandy Patinkin'],"Mandy Patinkin is an actor, singer and humanitician (a word he is aware he has made up). He is working with Swing Left , Vote Forward , the Democratic Party of Wisconsin and others to get out the vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Follow Patinkin on TikTok, Twitter and Instagram .

When we were first dating, my wife, Kathryn, asked me what political party my parents belonged to. I paused. ""The sisterhood and men's club?"" I replied, referring to the groups at their synagogue. I don't recall them ever voting, though it's certainly possible they did: a rote practice, absent strong conviction.

They were the children of immigrants, who had fled their homelands seeking better opportunity for their family. The United States was to them what it has strived to be for millions of people since its founding: a safe haven for people fleeing violence, tyranny and persecution, a place where one could find belonging regardless of creed, color or profession. To them, being here was blessing enough.

So, I considered myself apolitical. I didn't see it as particularly relevant or important to engage with the mess of politics. Until I fell in love.

My wife has been my north star in so many ways. She is always right, with very few exceptions -- mostly relating to the inner workings of our appliances (and even there she's rapidly gaining knowledge and is on track to outpace me by 2022).

Early on, when Kathryn and her friends would talk politics, I would politely listen and consider it something of an intellectual indulgence. Then, one day, her friend Martin Sheen turned and asked my opinion. I responded with my typical line, ""Oh, I'm not really political."" Martin smiled and replied, ""Do you breathe?""

He and Kathryn, and others like them, gently and patiently illuminated for me how every decision we make, every privilege we hold, every hardship we encounter, every service we partake in, every person we meet -- literally everything we do is political.

This realization is what has given my life meaning. Everything I do, I try to do in consideration of its impact and aim toward a greater good (with the possible exception of my dozens of hours researching the best refrigerators. That I do for me). So, when people tell me to ""stay out of politics,"" I can only think, ""but that's impossible.""

Love, not hate, forged my political consciousness. And when I look at this political moment, when I see the divisive, mean-spirited, hateful rhetoric that appears to be driving our politics, I can grow despondent. It can feel as though we've lost our way.

But when I look instead to the politics of everyday people, the way Kathryn and Martin and so many others taught me, I see something else. Amid a pandemic that has cost over 217,000 American lives , amid unbelievable economic hardship , and after nearly four years of increasingly partisan politics , I still see people caring for one another.

I see people fighting for one another -- caretakers and first responders tending to the sick, young people leading the march for the future of our planet, and people of every race, creed and age fighting for equality and racial justice . I see more people than ever becoming politically engaged. And I can think of no greater form of optimism.

America has a flawed foundation. From the beginning, the words that formed this government were more aspirational than the actions of even the authors. It has only been through the incredible will of people fighting for what's right that we have inched closer to our ultimate ideals.

Somehow, through every misguided or shameful choice in our history, those most marginalized and oppressed have led the way toward progress. That takes an incredible amount of optimism, and I have no doubt they did it not just for themselves, but for those they loved -- and for the generations that were to follow them.

I can understand why people might want to steer clear of politics right now, to suggest, ""I'm not political,"" and leave it at that. But to succumb to despair or exhaustion is to give up on the American project at the precise moment that it matters most. Something that gives me great hope is knowing that some of our most common ground as Americans is a shared desire to move away from such divided politics.

That's why I'm doing everything I can to get out the vote, and why, with a fundamental optimism, I'm supporting Joe Biden.

If you're conservative, you probably think Biden is too liberal. If you're liberal, you might think he's too conservative. That's the nature of these political divides. No matter what, if Biden is elected, it will be up to us as citizens to hold him accountable to enact the changes we believe are needed.

With Biden, I believe we can do that. While he may not be the perfect candidate -- and he'd likely be the first to admit that -- he is a decent man who wants to be of service to the public, unlike Donald Trump, who appears to want the public to be of service to him.

Biden is not a radical socialist. He's not dangerously conservative. You must know this. If anything, he plays to the center. That may not be exciting or enough for either side, but I think for now that's what we deserve -- so that we all may have some hope of meeting in the middle, too.

If you agree, then I ask you to get involved for these final weeks and work toward making make sure that we do not let hate and division triumph. Kathryn and I have been married for 40 years. You can imagine how often we've disagreed. What's kept us together hasn't been fighting -- it's been listening, learning from one another and having faith and optimism that we could get through anything together.

Now is the moment for us all to do the same: if we're going to fall in love with one another again, as Americans, then this is the time to show up, to commit and to make the right choice for our future."
The problem with changing the Electoral College (opinion),['Opinion Robert Alexander'],"Robert Alexander is a professor of political science and founding director of the Institute for Civics and Public Policy at Ohio Northern University. He is also the author of "" Representation and the Electoral College ."" Follow him on Twitter: @ onuprof . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) The Electoral College has been a controversial topic over the past few years. People tend to have very strong opinions about the institution, which, in most instances, comes down to who citizens believe is advantaged or disadvantaged by it. Ideally, a good electoral system should be neutral, where no party, candidate or region is advanced at the expense of another. Yet, this is among the chief criticisms we hear about our system.

For instance, in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election I gave a presentation explaining the Electoral College on the campus of UCLA and was met with bewilderment and frustration. Many questioned why voters in Ohio should be any more important than voters in California. As a native Buckeye, I didn't take it personally and instead explained that the audience was not alone in their frustration. After all, presidential elections are generally decided by a handful of so-called ""swing states.

This has recently led many to call for the abolition of the Electoral College in favor of a national popular vote. Yet, critics realize how resilient the institution has been, surviving nearly 800 attempts to amend or abolish it over the course of our nation's history. Most changes that have occurred have happened at the state level.

Short of a national popular vote, some have argued for a form of proportional representation similar to what Maine and Nebraska use. It is believed that this could be a way to democratize the Electoral College and produce campaigns that are more national in scope. However, such a plan is not without its own problems.

First, it is important to recognize that the Electoral College process leads candidates to ignore a majority of states across the country. Just as in 2016, most states in 2020 were not targeted by the presidential campaigns for their votes. This includes heavily populated states such as California and New York, but also less populated states like Montana, the Dakotas and Wyoming.

During the first nine weeks of the 2020 campaign, the bulk of presidential visits occurred in just 12 states and 85% occurred in just eight states. In addition to campaign visits, about 90% of television campaign spending was done in just six states through mid-October (Pennsylvania, Florida, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and North Carolina). Most states did not see a single campaign visit, nor did they see much in the way of campaign advertising. This is especially true among states that have few Electoral College votes.

Two notable exceptions are Maine and Nebraska. These are the only two states that award their electoral votes on the basis of who wins in their congressional district. If a ticket wins a plurality of the vote in a congressional district, they are awarded an electoral vote. Whichever ticket wins the popular vote across the states receives the ""bonus two"" electoral votes that each state receives corresponding to their representation in the United States Senate.

In 2008, Barack Obama captured an electoral vote in Nebraska's second congressional district. In 2016, Donald Trump earned an electoral vote in Maine's second congressional district. This year, both of these congressional districts have received attention from the presidential campaigns.

All other states use the winner-take-all method, which awards all of a state's electoral votes to the ticket that earns a plurality of the vote in the state. This method can lead to some pretty disproportionate outcomes which most often work to amplify the difference between a candidate's popular vote total and electoral vote total.

For instance, in 1992, Bill Clinton earned just over 43% of the popular vote but nearly 69% of the Electoral College vote. In 1980, Ronald Reagan earned 51% of the popular vote but 91% of the Electoral College vote. Some dubiously argue that this "" magnification effect"" provides legitimacy by amplifying a candidate's Electoral College total -- especially in close elections.

While most often this effect goes unnoticed, it can have especially significant consequences under some conditions.

The 2016 election is one of those instances. While Trump and Hillary Clinton each earned about 47% of the vote in Michigan in 2016, Trump pulled ahead by 0.2% of a point, yet he earned 100% of the state's 16 electoral votes. Similarly, Trump bested Clinton by 0.7% of votes in Pennsylvania, but earned all 20 of the state's electoral votes. And although Trump trailed Clinton by just 1.6% in Minnesota, he lost all 10 of the state's electoral votes. Looking only at the final electoral result does little to reflect how close the contests were in each of these states.

Because so many states are not competitive, many voters in these states may feel like their votes are wasted. This is reflected in President Trump's recent claim about the Electoral College system that ""The Republicans have a disadvantage. They lose New York, Illinois and California before it even starts."" Democrats in many other states dominated by Republicans would likely feel disadvantaged as well.

Proponents of the district plan suggest it more accurately reflects the electorate's wishes. It is believed that it would get rid of the idea that there are wasted votes in uncompetitive states and promote a more representative means to select the nation's chief executive. However, a move to use district elections is not without its pitfalls -- chiefly over the problem of gerrymandering.

Concerns over gerrymandering have persisted in American politics for two centuries. The term is attributed to Elbridge Gerry and it refers to the practice of drawing legislative districts to favor one political party over others.

If electoral votes across the country were tied to congressional districts, incentives to gerrymander would be extraordinary. For instance, while Obama was able to win Nebraska's 2nd congressional district in 2008, his chances were likely diminished after the 2010 census and the subsequent redrawing of the congressional district by the Nebraska legislature for the 2012 election. Using the district selection across the country would likely create a system of gerrymandering on steroids.

A second potential problem could be found in the role of third-party spoilers. It is conceivable that third parties or independent candidates could have strong showings in a few highly conservative or liberal congressional districts and ultimately claim a few electoral votes. This could matter at the margins, denying any candidate a majority of Electoral College votes.

This was among the concerns raised after the strong showing by George Wallace in the 1968 election when the House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to eliminate the Electoral College in favor of a popular vote a year later.

If no candidate receives a majority of the Electoral College vote, a contingent election would occur, meaning the House of Representatives would be charged with selecting the president. State power reigns supreme in a contingent election, as each state receives one vote. Thus, the 53 representatives from California would have one vote, and the one representative from Wyoming would have equal power. In fact, there are seven states that have just one representative -- all which would have the same weight as the delegations from Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois. This would not seem to be a desirable outcome for those wanting a more equitable system of representation.

A third concern is that moving to a district selection process could lead to even more misfire elections --elections where the winner of the national popular vote does not win in the Electoral College.

This situation has occurred in two of the last five presidential elections (in 2000 and 2016) and each was followed with widespread criticism of the Electoral College process. Interestingly, if all states had used the district selection process in 2012, analysts have estimated that Mitt Romney would have been another misfire president -- losing the popular vote by 5 million votes but capturing a majority of electoral votes because of the contours of Republican-friendly congressional districts.

Under a nationwide district selection process, both George W. Bush and Donald Trump would have still won in the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote in 2000 and 2016.

These outcomes underscore the role gerrymandering by state legislatures would have on the presidential selection process. It also suggests why Reince Priebus supported having some states adopt the district plan when he was the head of the Republican National Committee in 2013.

It is unlikely that a move to the district method throughout the states would lead to more fairly distributed nationwide campaigns, nor would they necessarily lead to more representative campaigns. Instead, we would likely see an even greater degree of politicization of the redistricting process, which would result in a system where candidates compete for a limited number of swing districts instead of swing states.

If Democrats continue to make inroads in states such as Texas and Georgia, we can expect the Republican-controlled state legislatures in those states will likely consider plans to change how they award their electoral votes from the winner-take-all system to the district system. Regardless of what unfolds in the 2020 election, the Electoral College will continue to be a source of controversy for the foreseeable future."

(CNN) Everything is terrible and nothing is OK. If you're feeling depressed and maxed out too, trust that you are far from alone.

-- A global pandemic has killed more than a million people, including more than 220,000 Americans, and is swelling into what public health officials warn will be a brutal second wave.

-- The Trump administration failed to manage the virus the first time around and seems to have no plan to make this second go any better.

-- A Democratic relief bill has been sitting for months, but Senate Republicans -- led by Mitch McConnell -- can spend the few days before a national election rushing through the confirmation of a far-right Supreme Court justice who seems likely to use her spot on the bench to undo progress on women's rights, voting rights and health care, and could thwart efforts of democratically elected representatives to see progressive legislation upheld and carried out.

-- The existing Supreme Court had already signaled its willingness to suppress American votes, ruling that mail-in ballots arriving after Election Day in Wisconsin are invalid.

-- In the meantime, millions of Americans are unemployed, furloughed or facing tenuous employment futures, and President Trump is playing footsie with conspiracy theorists and telling far-right groups to ""stand back and stand by.""

In what is for many Americans a truly terrible year, waking up into Tuesday -- as Covid-19 rages on, and with the hangover of misbegotten Supreme Court confirmation -- manages to stand out as particularly awful. With maximum pandemic stress rushing in, maximum stress from the impending election, everything -- democracy, our lives -- feels at stake. It's enough to make you want to fall apart.

So how to deal?

It's easy to get caught up in endless doom-scrolling, to sink into a pit of despair. It's a rational reaction to this moment, when so many of our fellow citizens are dead, sick, or hurting, and when a whole series of basic rights many Americans took for granted are freshly vulnerable.

It's OK not to feel like bucking up, to want to hide under the covers and melt into a sea of misery. Go ahead.

Just don't stay too long.

But remember, take care of yourself. Listen to Doomscrolling Reminder Lady , Karen Ho: Stand up and walk around. Take some deep breaths. Roll out your wrists and wiggle your shoulders. Log out of the apps that make you anxious. Get away from screens awhile. Put on your mask and go for a walk outside. Call a loved one.

Then, do something. There is still time to convert despair into action. You've voted, right? Or if you haven't voted, what's your voting plan on Election Day? What's your plan if lines are long?

Both presidential campaigns are doing lots of get-out-the-vote work right now, but people are often more likely to vote if someone close to them gives them a nudge. Have you talked to your family members about their voting plan? Your friends? Your colleagues? Your acquaintances from high school who you're connected with on Facebook?

Are you talking about voting for the president, but also for the down-ticket races? Are you connecting voting to the basic day-to-day issues Americans face -- and emphasizing that who wins this election will decide how much economic relief Americans get as the economy fails them (under Trump, it's been no relief for months) and the future of American health care (expanding the Affordable Care Act under Joe Biden; destroying it under Trump).

And don't forget. There is also life beyond this election. One candidate will win; the other will lose (and hopefully, we'll know who's who by next week). There may be more despairing yet to do, or there may be a moment of hope.

No matter who wins, there will most certainly be work to do. Maybe it will be continued resistance against the worst excesses of an administration that leans toward authoritarianism , coupled with redoubled individual efforts to stay physically safe and financially afloat with little assistance from the government.

Or maybe it will be putting the pieces of a broken country back together. That will mean reconciling or reaching détente where we can. But it will also require working to figure out how so many Americans have so quickly accepted abject cruelty, embraced hyperpartisan animus, and descended into fringe conspiracy-mongering (and while these ills are concentrated on the far right, they are not exclusive to it).

Real reconciliation and healing is a slow, difficult and intentional process; it won't happen with Kumbaya cliches or an agreement to disagree. But if we want to stitch our frayed nation back to one, it's what we will have to do -- all of us.

First, though, we need to make sure that as many Americans as possible have their voices heard at the ballot box. When so many are sick, grieving, and going hungry, not everyone has the ability to engage politically, push despair aside, and encourage others to vote.

But those of us who are physically and mentally capable don't have the privilege of complacency. The next week shapes everything -- and then there is much more to come."

(CNN) They say bad things happen in threes. That held true for me when I wrapped up a busy and chaotic two days covering Hurricane Zeta.

No, it wasn't the storm that dealt me a one-two-three punch. It was a series of racist encounters that knocked me off my feet.

Like many people of Asian descent in America, I have been targeted with cruel playground taunts as a child and continue to face racist or ignorant comments from strangers as an adult. Sadly, that's nothing new. In fact, I can confidently say it is part of the Asian American experience. Nothing could have prepared me, however, for the succession of ignorance and hate I encountered on Thursday.

Here's what happened. As I was walking through New Orleans' international airport to catch my flight home, an older man who was walking past me stopped in his tracks, lowered his mask, and said, ""Ni Hao. Ching Chong.""

""Ni hao"" means hello in Chinese. Never mind that I'm of Korean descent. ""Ching Chong,"" of course, is a racial slur that has been used to mock Asian Americans for more than a century. Those words tore through me the way they did when boys at school would tease me, turning their eyes up with their fingers, chanting ""Ching Chong China."" As a child, I would run home and cry in my room, too embarrassed to tell even my parents what had happened.

As an adult, I have not been shy about confronting those who disrespect and stereotype my Asian heritage. But for some reason, this time, I just kept walking. My blood began to boil as I wondered why people have the audacity to approach complete strangers with the intent to ridicule them for the way they look.

When the man ended up standing behind me in a line inside the terminal, I sternly asked him if he understood that his comments were racist and absolutely inappropriate. With a smug look on his face, he denied everything and walked away.

Minutes later, I was sitting with my producer at the gate, when a young man without a mask approached me, and asked, ""Do you speak English?"" I couldn't believe what was happening and I shot back rhetorically, ""Why would you assume that I don't speak English?"" To which he ignorantly replied, ""What language do you speak?"" I know he was expecting me to say Japanese, Chinese, or Korean. But I replied, ""Spanish!"" Then he started to speak incoherently in what sounded like a fabricated Asian language.

I asked him to leave, repeatedly. My producer, who was in disbelief, also demanded that the stranger leave me alone. He refused and started yelling obscenities. Then, several good Samaritans waiting at the gate interjected and came to my defense. They also told him to stop harassing me as my producer called security.

When the airport officer arrived, I described the encounter. My producer summed it up by saying the harasser was being racist. Unbelievably, the police officer confronted my producer, inches from his face, and vehemently disputed our account. He angrily yelled, ""That was not racist! OK? Asking if she speaks English is not racist, OK? Do you understand me?""

Here we were, asking for help. Instead, the officer interjected with his opinion and rather than de-escalating the situation, he intimidated us.

I understand that inquiring whether or not someone speaks English is not inherently racist. It can be an honest question and it depends on the context.

But when the two men at the airport looked at me and automatically assumed I didn't speak English and followed it up with a racial slur or taunt, what was I supposed to think? Why did they conclude English was not my native language? Because of the way I look? The assumption that I must be a foreigner, and the insinuation I don't belong in this country, is one that we Asian Americans face all the time.

Just like when I'm asked, ""Where are you from?"" And when I answer, ""I'm from Southern California,"" the follow up is typically, ""No, where are you really from?"" The airport incident was another example of being judged based on my appearance and the stereotypes that go along with it.

The faulty conclusion was I couldn't be American. But what is an American supposed to look like? And why does it matter? Like my husband so eloquently put it, ""People think I'm more American than you because I'm White. They don't know I have a German accent and that I moved to this country when I was 20 years old.""

The Anti-Defamation League defines racism as , ""The marginalization and/or oppression of people of color based on a socially constructed racial hierarchy that privileges white people."" So the very premise of the encounters were absolutely racist.

I hate that I have to justify that I'm American. I was born and raised in the US by hardworking immigrants from South Korea. My parents, who became naturalized citizens 40 years ago, have always embraced America as the land of opportunity, despite the fact that they, too, were subjected to racism much worse than what I have experienced.

It still saddens me to think about how lonely they must have felt when they arrived in Richmond, Virginia, in the 1970s unable to speak English and unable to defend themselves against the bigotry they faced. The most benign comment they heard was, ""Go back to where you came from.""

Many of my non-Asian friends are shocked when I tell them that they'd be hard pressed to find an Asian American who hasn't had a similar experience with racism or other forms of ignorance, intolerance or discrimination.

In fact, since I shared my experience on social media, and the history of racism I've faced, I've received numerous messages from strangers whose stories echo mine. ""Reading about incidents like yours reminds me of all those times I've felt like an outsider, just because of how I look. People say, 'ni hao' or 'konichiwa' to me all the time on the streets and I always ignore them, but I hope to have the courage you have and start telling people why that is so offensive,"" one email reads.

Another states, ""Eleven hours after you posted, I'm reading it and suddenly tumbling backwards in time, 40 years. The elementary school part in particular made me dizzy. It's practically exactly what happened to me in first grade. First day at a new school a boy sees me on the bus and starts to taunt me by saying, ""Ching Chong! Chinky eyes!"" and does the same slanting of eyes you mentioned. He followed me off the bus, chased me and pushed me down on the grass. I'll never forget the shock when he sat on my chest and I could not breathe, not understanding what was happening and why. It was deeply traumatizing. Up until that point I did not know that I was different. I'm touching my chest now remembering the place he sat, how constricted my chest felt. I still remember what he looked like -- blonde with a bowl cut, with cruel laughter. After that all I wanted to be was blonde hair, blue-eyed 'all-American.'""

I have been overwhelmed by the hundreds of messages of support and solidarity. They remind me that for every hateful person, there are many more decent humans who value dignity, equality and the diversity of our country.

Racism is not exclusive to New Orleans. These incidents could have happened anywhere. To be honest, I was surprised by the widespread interest in my story and the passionate responses it continues to garner. I know, it sounds counterintuitive, given that I am a network TV journalist, but I just didn't think anyone would care about the challenges we endure as Asian Americans. But when I see messages like these, I'm proven wrong:

""You absolutely belong in US, thank you for standing up.""

""I walked in your shoes almost daily.""

""I can relate, but I never spoke up. Until now.""

"For the Walter Wallaces of the world, the police are not the answer (Opinion)",['Opinion Camille Proctor'],"Camille Proctor is the founder and executive director of The Color of Autism Foundation, an organization committed to educating and assisting African American families with autistic children. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) When I hear about the many fatal police encounters involving people, particularly Black men and boys, who are suffering from some sort of mental health episode, I cringe not only at the sad details, but at the way many people are so quick to say, ""train the police.""

It is simply not a long-term solution to expect officers to be able to, for example, accurately differentiate a real threat from someone who is in crisis and needs mental help. There needs to be a specific system put in place that routinely incorporates the expertise of mental health experts to de-escalate these situations.

Camille Proctor

I cannot read the story of Walter Wallace Jr. and others like him who were in crisis when they encountered law enforcement, without thinking of my 14-year-old son, Ari, who was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder when he was two.

By now many people are familiar with ""the talk"" that parents have with their Black children about how to act if they ever have to deal with the police. Well, when you're a parent to a Black child who communicates differently, the weight of giving that talk can feel a bit heavier.

In the months that followed Ari's diagnosis, I remember going to support groups and being the only Black parent there. I asked questions relevant to African Americans like: What's going to happen if my son is still unable to speak when he's a teenager, 6 ft tall, doesn't understand how to yield and gets stopped by the police?"
Opinion: Sean Connery's image obscured his work ethic and versatility,['Opinion Gene Seymour'],"Gene Seymour is a film critic who has written about music, movies and culture for The New York Times, Newsday, Entertainment Weekly and The Washington Post. Follow him on Twitter @GeneSeymour. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) Imagine a world where Sir Sean Connery never gets within smelling distance of the role of James Bond. Let's say the part went to somebody else, anybody else: Christopher Plummer, or Patrick McGoohan (who was offered the role, but turned it down) or even Roger Moore, who was said to be in the running in the early 1960s -- a decade before he took on the legendary role.

Gene Seymour

Even without 007 and his ""license to kill,"" Connery, whose death at age 90 was confirmed early Saturday, would still deserve his knighthood -- and his global reputation as one of the most versatile of movie stars.

Think of his young tyro days, when Connery's brash, brawny exuberance got audiences' attention in such myriad fare as ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" (1959) or ""The Longest Day"" (1962). Or consider Connery in greybeard, during the autumn of his career. He played a crime-solving monk in ""The Name of the Rose"" (1986), a hard-bitten Chicago patrolman in ""The Untouchables"" (1987), for which he won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, or Harrison Ford's father in ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" (1989). He was one of those rare actors who was always recognizable in whatever he played while making each role his own.

David Thomson, in his ""New Biographical Dictionary of Film,"" compared him to Clark Gable ""who had the same mix of mustache and twinkle and a similar hint of uncompromising force."" As with Gable, Connery also carried an unusually harmonious combination of street brawler and sophisticate -- the kind of elegant ruffian who could be funny or tragic, roguish or tormented, noble or weaselly.

Connery's do-it-all-and-do-it-often work ethic was obscured by the James Bond image, which helps explains why he was so desperate to get out from under one of the most spectacularly successful tentpoles in movie history. He was the first Bond and, to this day, the most definitive because he carried the ""cruel mouth"" and ""short, black hair"" that Ian Fleming used as physical descriptions of his British secret service agent years before the film adaptations.

How to read Pope Francis' message of love for LGBTQ people (opinion),['Opinion Allison Hope'],"Allison Hope is a writer whose work has been featured by The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, Slate and elsewhere. The views expressed here are the author's. Read more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) The highest Catholic in all the world has pushed the door towards LGBTQ inclusion open further by pronouncing that same-sex couples, historically excluded from traditional religious and civil institutions like marriage, ought to have legal protections that recognize their unions.

According to the Catholic News Agency, Pope Francis, in an interview for a documentary released in Rome on Wednesday, said that civil unions should be the law of the land for same-sex couples.

""What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are legally covered,"" he said , elaborating that LGBTQ people are children of God.

In the past, Pope Francis has said he is not against civil unions, but this is the first time since becoming Pope that he has directly stated he favors them. (He advocated for same-sex civil unions when he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires.)

His recent comments stand in stark contrast with the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church Pope Francis leads, which has long taken the posture that same-sex acts are ""intrinsically disordered.""

The Pope's comments, while shared in the context of a documentary and not necessarily as a formal, written decree or a consensus among the Catholic leadership in Rome or elsewhere, will have a huge global ripple effect on communities, jurisdictions, families and individuals. The Pope's compassion is a welcome sign from a religion that has long alienated LGBTQ people. Whether part of an active ploy to lure back disaffected congregants or a genuine statement of inclusion, his words are a helpful evolution for the many LGBTQ people who have been ostracized simply because of who they are and who they love.

JUST WATCHED Transgender man says he met with Pope privately Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Transgender man says he met with Pope privately 01:51

To be clear, the civil union stance is also so 1998. We have since learned, in the courts and on the streets, that civil unions are not the same as full marriage rights, and separate but equal is never equal . That said, the highest seat in one of the world's most dominant religions has allowed that LGBTQ people deserve to love and be loved, and that our love should be treated with respect and validity.

Pope Francis has been billed the most progressive Pope in history. He has made pronouncements in favor of respecting people who are LGBTQ, stating in 2013 , ""If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?"" He embraced -- literally hugged -- Diego Neria Lejarraga, a transgender man who had been ostracized by religious leaders in his native Spain in 2015 . Pope Francis has also opened up a ""mercy window"" to lend forgiveness for people who have had abortions and asked that the faithful embrace immigrants and refugees.

In 2003, in contrast, under the pontificate of Pope John Paul II, the church's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, then led by the future Pope Benedict XVI, issued ""Considerations regarding proposals to give legal recognition to unions between homosexual persons,"" in which it wrote, ""The Church teaches that respect for homosexual persons cannot lead in any way to approval of homosexual behavior or to legal recognition of homosexual unions.""

Francis's public softening on LGBTQ protections comes as the Catholic church faces record abandonment by new generations of people coming of age who no longer cling to organized religion as a guidepost or community building resource. Covid-19 has only exacerbated the struggle many churches face as donations drop, religious schools close, and chapels and other religious institutions make headlines as hosts for superspreader events.

Meanwhile, much of organized religion, and the Catholic Church in particular, have long served as the biggest moral finger-pointers and impediments to the evolution of LGBTQ social and political equality. Citing religion as the reason to discriminate has been and is still a favorite strategy of political operatives in America as well, despite the constitutional demand for the separation of church and state.

A case is presently scheduled to be heard before the Supreme Court on November 4, the day after Election Day, which asks the question of whether a Philadelphia-based Catholic adoption agency -- which takes government dollars -- can turn LGBTQ (and Jewish and anyone who doesn't fit their mold) foster parents away because of their strongly-held religious beliefs. Two standing Supreme Court Justices recently let out that they believe the 2015 ruling on marriage equality didn't go the right way, leaving the strong possibility that laws pertaining to LGBTQ families are at risk.

In this context, the Pope's remarks -- unofficial and dated as they may be -- are a signal that a leader of immense power is still looking on LGTBQ people with compassion and love, with the belief that our lives and families deserve to exist under the law. As our long-fought rights hang in the balance with threats of our family's protections being yanked from under us -- with religion so often the attempted justification -- the Pope's comments are more than just refreshing; if heeded by Catholics across the world, they may indeed be life-saving."
Someone told me I'd never model because I'm disabled. I proved them wrong at NY Fashion Week (opinion),['Opinion Melissa Blake'],"Melissa Blake is a freelance writer and blogger from Illinois.

(CNN) When I was a teenager, someone said that I could never be a model because I'm disabled.

Those words stung. Not because they crushed my long-held dreams of becoming the next great fashion icon, but because they just reaffirmed society's ableist thinking: That there was no place for disability in fashion.

Melissa Blake

This year, though, more than 20 years later, I modeled in New York Fashion Week (NYFW), where I got to wear an outfit from Zappos Adaptive and make a short video. It feels like a win for me, sure, but it's a huge win for disability representation in fashion.

That win has been a long time coming (after years of discouragement) but it's arrived at a moment when disability representation in everything from Halloween costumes to holiday films is improving. I hold on to these cultural victories all the more at a time when the political landscape for many disabled Americans feels especially precarious . I'd like to believe that, although the pandemic has robbed so many disabled people of health and access to needed services, the necessarily revised approach to what we wear and how we express ourselves in a Covid world may at least bring about long overdue (and hopefully lasting) changes in how we define fashion and beauty.

I've always admired fashion, but I never thought I'd actually be a part of it one day. Like so many teenagers, I grew up in the 1990s reading magazines like Cosmopolitan and Glamour, where the pages were filled with the likes of Cindy Crawford and Naomi Campbell. As I'd flip over each glossy page, I was always hoping to see disabled women like me, but I never did."
Kim Kardashian West's clueless birthday party (opinion),['Opinion Peggy Drexler'],"Peggy Drexler is a research psychologist and the author of ""Our Fathers, Ourselves: Daughters, Fathers, and the Changing American Family"" and ""Raising Boys Without Men.""

(CNN) Kim Kardashian West, you may have heard, turned 40 this week. To celebrate, the television personality threw herself a big party on a private island and invited along a few dozen friends. As part of the celebration, she shared the event with her 190 million and 67 million followers on Instagram and Twitter, respectively, because sharing is what Kardashian West does. Sharing, with few boundaries, is how she built her brand.

Peggy Drexler

And, now, it appears sharing may be how she undoes it, too.

Not surprisingly, the reality star and mogul is facing considerable backlash (""Your life seems taxing. @KimKardashian People are struggling in our country and you parade your wealth. Enjoy your cake,"" wrote one person on Twitter) for what many have considered a cruel and insensitive display of privilege during a time of global crisis.

It's not so much that the party seemed unsafe at a time when Covid-19 infections and deaths are rising in many parts of the world. Kardashian made a point to note that her friends were asked to quarantine for two weeks before the event. Nor was the event even accidentally ill-timed -- one's birthday is, after all, a fixed date.

The problem is that she chose, apparently without much awareness or acknowledgment, to share the extravagance of that birthday while so many millions around the world are sick, out of work and going nowhere. Mental illness is at a high; countries are once more closing down.

And the Dude will abide cancer.

Have you ever gone to a doctor with a potential infection and had them feel around the sides of your neck? Well, they were likely feeling for your lymph nodes there. You have these small oval-shaped glands all over your body -- including in your armpits, your groin and behind your knees. Your 600 lymph nodes are where your body filters out bad stuff -- like toxins and infections.

I know all this because I was diagnosed with lymphoma in July 2013.

Early that year, I had found an odd bump on my thigh. A few weeks later, that little bump had grown to the size of a grape. Over the next couple of months, it grew to the size of a ping pong ball and then further to the proportions of a small egg. That's when I insisted on surgery to get it out of me, despite an MRI that had come back benign, and grumbling from my then-primary care physician that I was being alarmist. Malignant or benign, grumble or endorsement, I didn't want this alien growing inside me anymore.

Waking up from surgery, groggy from the anesthesia, I saw in front of me something you never want to see in these situations -- a grim-faced doctor. He told my wife and me that he had bad news: I had one of two ailments, either cat-scratch fever or lymphoma.

Before that moment, the only ""cat-scratch fever"" I knew was a 1977 song by Ted Nugent . My amazing wife, Jenn, quickly Googled it and learned that the sickness by the same name is tough to get. As the CDC says, it's transmitted when ""an infected cat licks a person's open wound, or bites or scratches a person hard enough to break the surface of the skin."" That seemed highly unlikely since a) we have no cats, b) I'm not really a ""cat person"" and c) I certainly hadn't had THAT kind of contact with a cat.

So, unfortunately, that left lymphoma. At 41 years old, I had to face the dreaded ""c-word"" -- cancer.

I was petrified. Despite the amazing support of my family and friends, I felt absolutely alone. I had barely even heard of lymphoma before my diagnosis. I surely didn't know anyone with lymphoma. Most devastatingly, I was worried that I had just received a death sentence.

But, as I laid out in a prior CNN.com opinion piece written when then-Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein was diagnosed with the disease, I quickly learned it was not a death sentence and I was not alone.

In the tweet announcing his diagnosis, Mr. Bridges wrote, ""New S**T has come to light."" It's a classic line uttered by The Dude in ""The Big Lebowski."" Bridges was, of course, referring to his cancer diagnosis itself in his tweet, but you could also say a lot of new s**t has come to light in the world of lymphoma and this s**t is really exciting.

Twenty-five years ago, the standard of care for many lymphomas was a pretty brutal regimen of chemotherapy. For those uninitiated to cancer, it's rather stunning to learn that another way of thinking about chemotherapy is simply this: You are essentially putting poison in your body. Now let me be clear: Chemotherapy has saved countless millions of lives. But while it can be extremely efficient at killing the cancer cells in your body, it will also certainly cause some collateral damage. That's why you can lose your hair, for instance, or have bouts of nausea.

When I went through treatment seven years ago, I had a relatively tolerable chemo regimen -- just a few infusions in manageable doses, then daily sessions of radiation targeted at the area where my tumor had been removed. I did, in fact, lose my hair from the chemo (and most of my sense of taste, too -- everything tasted ""gray,"" even my favorite food: pizza).

Included in my chemo cocktail was a drug called rituximab, which isn't chemotherapy at all but one of the first-ever immune therapies -- a way to use the body's own immune system to fight illness. Here's how this one works: It attaches itself to a protein found on the bad cells (and some of the good ones, too) and tells the body's immune system to come destroy those cells. The foot soldiers of the immune system do what they are told and zap the cells. If all goes well, the good ones grow back, the bad ones don't, and the patient goes on to live a long life.

Rituximab was introduced in 1997 and the death rate for the major subtype of lymphoma has been declining ever since. And it's not just rituximab, according to Meghan Gutierrez. She's the CEO of the Lymphoma Research Foundation (LRF), a non-profit dedicated to funding research to find a cure while also educating and supporting patients who are facing down the disease. In the 25 years LRF has been in existence, more than 100 new therapies (and new uses for old ones) have been approved for lymphoma and related cancers. That's almost unheard of for one disease, Gutierrez told me. I should note: I learned a lot from the foundation when I was sick and I now sit on its board of directors.

Thanks to the work of nonprofits like LRF, governmental agencies like the National Cancer Institute, and research scientists and clinicians around the world, the future looks brighter. My own oncologist, Memorial Sloan Kettering's Dr. Connie Batlevi , told me that ""cool"" developments abound.

Batlevi points to CAR T-Cell therapy which goes even further to super-charge the body's own immune system to fight lymphoma.

There's also a push, Batlevi says, to use genetics to guide treatment. If you remember back to your high school biology, our cells are constantly dividing. When those cells divide, a genetic error can make them divide in an uncontrolled manner. That's how cancer forms. If doctors know what kind of genetic error caused a patient's cancer, they can pinpoint a very specific treatment plan based on that mutation.

Lymphoma vaccines are another weapon scientists are currently testing in clinical trials. When we think of vaccines these days, our minds go immediately to the push for a vaccine to inoculate us against Covid-19. But, as the American Cancer Society explains , the lymphoma vaccine would not prevent the disease but to treat somebody who already has it: ""to create an immune reaction against lymphoma cells.""

""Do I have one of the good lymphomas or one of the bad ones?"" That's the question Dr. Batlevi says patients ask her all the time. Her response: ""None of them are great but all of them are potentially manageable and curable.""

I can tell you from personal experience that it's true. And let me be very clear: this is a deadly disease. It has killed friends and acquaintances of mine, and it kills 20,000 people every year. But as science continues to rapidly innovate, prospects will only get better and life will only get easier for those of us diagnosed with this and other cancers.

Bridges shared few details of his diagnosis in his tweets but betrayed a welcome sense of optimism: ""The prognosis is good...[I] will keep you posted on my recovery.""

Sounds good, Mr. Bridges. We're all rooting for you and wishing you an easy course of treatment and many peaceful years of life on the other side of it!"
Celebrating Halloween? We've maxed out on dread in 2020 (opinion),['Opinion Holly Thomas'],"Holly Thomas is a writer and editor based in London. She tweets @HolstaT. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) The social significance of Halloween in the US is familiar across the world, thanks in no small part to virtually every American sitcom ever made.

During the first wave of the pandemic in the UK, my boyfriend's chief form of escapism was the television comedy ""Modern Family."" As is common in comforting, set-your-watch-by-it TV, the series features a dedicated episode every season in which the Dunphy clan is corralled by overworked mom Claire (played by actress Julie Bowen) into ever more absurd scare scenes, complete with preposterously elaborate props, and costumes no one with a regular job could realistically create or afford.

Holly Thomas

The question this episode always prompted from my Halloween-hating beloved — besides ""No, but seriously, how rich are they?"" — was ""What's the point?"" In the past, he could justifiably have been rebuffed as a massive downer. But as October 31 approaches, and people in the US, UK and elsewhere consider the possibility of ""organizing something"" for Halloween, the idea of celebrating a non-religious, non-commemorative holiday — even accounting for socially distanced modifications — feels pretty uncomfortable.

An obvious explanation for this might be ""Well duh, it's a night all about ghosts and death, and we're in the middle of a deadly pandemic."" But I don't think that's it. Yes, a millennium or so ago the Celts did some very unfortunate dressing-up in the name of tricking evil spirits. But the modern popular incarnation of Halloween, which is as much (if not more) about adults letting off steam as kids getting their candy, has as much to do with death as ghosting someone on Tinder has.

It seems unlikely that the usual hordes of "" zeitgeist, but make it sexy "" college students, and fright-night-obsessed parents ever really paused amid the slasher movies or apple bobbing to ponder: ""but my mortality."" The discomfort with Halloween 2020 lies elsewhere, and is easier to identify as soon as we recognize the night for what it is: a frivolous pop-cultural exercise, on which the organizers — adults — superimpose their most basic desires."
The 8-year-old who fears adults can't be trusted to fix the climate crisis (opinion),['Opinion John D. Sutter'],"John D. Sutter is a CNN contributor and a National Geographic Explorer. He is director of the forthcoming BASELINE series , which is visiting four locations on the front lines of the climate crisis every five years until 2050. Visit the project's website . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) Noah is an 8-year-old in Flamborough, Ontario. He loves nature shows and his two cats, Shadow and Whispers (he probably meant to name the second cat ""Whiskers,"" according to his mom, but he mixes those words up sometimes). When he grows up, he wants to be a veterinarian or a nature photographer -- something that puts him in touch with animals and the Earth.

Lately, according to his mom, Jodi Green, Noah has become preoccupied with the climate crisis. He learned about it last year in school during a Greta Thunberg-style rally where students came together to demand swifter action on the global climate emergency, she said.

Ever since, he's been brimming with questions.

He sent one of those questions -- a doozy -- to me recently as part of my new series for CNN Opinion, called "" Let's talk about the climate apocalypse ."" ""I want to know what I can do to change the world and make it better for my own children one day,"" wrote Noah, who later told me he wants to have two kids when he grows up. ""I am looking for specific actions and steps that will help me take control of the situation and fight climate change. I do not think leaving it up to the adults is working out very well.""

Thank you for that, Noah. And thank you also to the hundreds of you who sent thoughtful questions to us as part of this series. I'll be responding to them over coming weeks.

Noah, I agree we adults of the world aren't doing right by you or your future. I share your mother's concerns about what the weight of the world that's sitting on your shoulders could do to you. (""I worry about him and all kids,"" Green told me recently by phone. ""I worry about them getting depressed about [the climate crisis] and giving up on it -- feeling hopeless."") It's not fair that climate change has become the burden of the young simply because your generation will live on this planet far longer than mine or your mom's. There's more we all can do.

Noah's mom says he loves to go out and find frogs in the back yard. He makes a place with water and rocks for them to hang out in, observes them and then releases them near the river that runs behind the house so that they are safe from the lawn mower when his dad cuts the grass.

I'm going to offer a few specific suggestions knowing full well that none of them is enough but that if effort is thrown behind all of them, from all corners of the world, we can fix this. There is hope. First, though, I want to set up the context of this conversation. I think that will benefit Noah a bit. But this is really for the adults who need to catch up to him -- who have not been paying quite as much attention to this issue and the magnitude of this moment.

I'll do that by way of answering two other questions from readers.

Christopher, from Oklahoma (my home state), asked something I know many adults are wondering: ""Can you explain the relationship between carbon dioxide and global warming?""

Some of you likely will roll your eyes at this question. Unroll them, please. I've met many smart people over the years who never learned, or never fully grasped, the basic mechanics of global warming. It's always best to define our terms before going any further.

The story begins in the 1850s, when the scientists Eunice Foote and John Tyndall separately discovered an important property of the gas carbon dioxide: It absorbs heat from the sun. (Foote's experiments preceded Tyndall's by three years, but he usually gets the credit because he was an established scientist and because, well, he was a man and the world was and still is sexist). That CO2 absorbs heat and reflects it back to the surface of the planet is a good thing when the atmosphere is in balance. It helps create a livable environment on Earth. But these discoveries hinted at trouble to come as humans began altering the atmosphere.

A scan of Foote's paper ""Circumstances affecting the heat of the Sun's rays "" from the American Journal of Science (1857).

A century later, Charles David Keeling, a scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, began measuring the level of that heat-trapping gas. His finding was frightening: Carbon dioxide was gradually accumulating in the atmosphere. Keeling helped develop what would become a global network of sensors measuring the buildup of carbon dioxide, or CO2.

OK, so that's a little context for you. Christopher, you can read more about the relationship between CO2 and global warming on NASA's website. Thank you for that question.

Ari, in Miami, asked what needs to change by the year 2030 (the year Noah will turn 18) ""in order to achieve a safe and stable climate and future for the world.""

This is a big discussion, but the simplest and best answer comes from a 2018 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations-affiliated entity that reviews climate science and, every so often, produces reports that synthesize that knowledge.

To have a reasonable chance of stopping global warming short of 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels -- which is the goal set by the Paris Agreement -- then the world needs to cut carbon pollution roughly in half by the year 2030, and then to net zero by 2050.

In 2019, for context, the fossil fuel industry put 37 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Carbon emissions are expected to be down about 4% to 7% this year, according to a May 2020 study published in Nature Climate Change, because of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has slowed travel and the global economy, along with associated pollution.

Few experts expect those changes to last, though, once the pandemic is over.

Emissions had been climbing until the pandemic.

JUST WATCHED What we'll have to endure as the climate crisis gets worse Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What we'll have to endure as the climate crisis gets worse 01:18

To meet that 2030 target, global emissions need to decline about 8% per year beginning this year, according to a 2019 analysis -- the ""Emissions Gap Report"" -- from the UN Environment Program. That would require a radical shift in the world economy, which is why you hear activists and, increasingly, politicians calling for a shift to clean energy as fast as possible.

So far, the world's pledges to reduce emissions as part of the Paris Agreement are not enough. Instead of limiting warming to 2 degrees, they would push temperatures near or beyond the 3-degree Celsius mark; that's a truly scary level of warming. Already we're seeing the effects of a planet we've been heating up for decades. The truth is that all of this talk about the future is a matter of probabilities: The more pollution, the greater risk to us all. Already, humans have contributed to more than 1 degree Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels.

Not enough about the energy system is changing.

Not by a long shot.

OK, Noah. Forgive that detour, please.

Let's get back to you and your question.

Noah, age 8, in Ontario, wrote: ""I want to know what I can do to change the world and make it better for my own children one day. I am looking for specific actions and steps that will help me take control of the situation and fight climate change.""

Let me offer two suggestions.

The first: Do what you can in your personal life -- and in your household -- to connect your own actions to the global struggle to reduce emissions and stabilize the atmosphere.

That includes eating (or asking your parents to consider letting you eat) more plants and fewer animals. Cattle and lamb, in particular, have an outsize impact on greenhouse gas pollution. (There are plenty of beef alternatives, and eating chicken and pork has less climate impact than beef, by far). It means biking and walking more, driving less. It means limiting air travel, especially across oceans. It means educating yourself -- Project Drawdown is a great resource -- about the most effective solutions to the climate crisis, many of which involve governments and energy systems and infrastructure. When you're old enough, it means voting, and making climate change one of your top priorities as you consider political candidates and parties.

Noah's mom says, ""He loves all the small creatures that he finds and worries that the snakes might get hungry but can't bear the thought of the frogs getting eaten.""

These personal life actions are important, I believe, not because you should feel responsible for the climate crisis -- you have nothing to feel guilty about -- and not because your actions, on their own, will change the global carbon budget. But I do think these actions are meaningful in that they connect you to the global struggle at hand, which will require so much more than individual actions to fix. I think about the environmentalist Edward Abbey, who wrote , ""Sentiment without action is the ruin of the soul."" It's healthy -- necessary -- to live out the truths you believe in. There's something powerful and life-affirming about it.

So, do what you can to help. Also: Get outside and enjoy the natural world -- enjoy the animals you care about. Celebrate this magical place. Your enthusiasm is infectious.

My second piece of advice is to use your voice. You, along with millions of other young people all around the world, realize truths far too many adults shy away from: The planet is in major trouble; we've been messing it up for decades and decades; and the time for change is now.

The truth is that adults are responsible for this mess you're inheriting; we owe it to you to do more. But that doesn't change the fact that you do have an important voice, and you can make a real difference. Witness what Greta Thunberg has created with the global Fridays for Future movement. Millions and millions of young people like yourself have been moved by her story.

I know, as I said, this answer is not fully adequate. I promise to keep you in mind as I explore other questions and other aspects of the climate crisis in coming weeks. This theme -- what more can we do -- came up in dozens of questions from adults and children alike.

I'll keep coming back to it.

For now, I'll leave you by saying that you give me hope. Your insight, and caring, outpace many adults. I find it admirable that you love polar bears and seals -- that you learn about them from TV -- and that you want those species to exist when you're old enough to have children of your own. I want that, too, and I want humans to be safe from the devastating storms, fires, floods and droughts that continue to intensify as we pump heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere.

Your name, Noah, carries the story of a Biblical/Quranic figure who built a ship that rescued the world's animals and people from a flood. I see your warmth and compassion in that story. You mom told me she had that story in mind as she named you. She waited until she met you in the hospital before deciding on that name, which also means peace. ""I knew it was right,"" she said.

Thank you for asking this question, and for caring.

As you said: ""It's about the future.""

"On a dark road in Georgia, a stranger cried for help (opinion)",['Thomas Lake'],"In a series of essays called The Distance, Thomas Lake is telling the stories of Americans in the pandemic. Email thomas.lake@cnn.com if you have a story idea.

(CNN) Five days after the roadside incident, I took my first coronavirus test. I felt weary and brittle, my head and joints aching, a flickering pain in my heart.

""I've heard that it hurts,"" I said to the blue-gowned woman who held what resembled a very long Q-Tip.

""I wouldn't say it hurts,"" she said, through my open car window, beneath a white tent outside an abandoned Kmart, ""but it is uncomfortable, for sure.""

She jammed the swab up my nose. It was uncomfortable, for sure. She twisted the swab. A tear rolled down my cheek. If indeed I had the virus, I knew of only one possible exposure. Had I done the right thing on that dark country road? Or would my wife and children suffer for my awful mistake?

We'd been so careful the last six months. No travel, no hairstylists, no friends or relatives inside the house. If either of us ran an errand in a crowded place, we came home and went straight to the shower. My wife bought a gadget that disinfected our phones with ultraviolet light.

And then, in the space of a few seconds, I flung all that caution into the moonlit night.

It began on a Saturday in early September. At home in the pandemic I sometimes felt trapped, almost claustrophobic, deprived of variety and new experience. That afternoon I loaded our three older children into the minivan and drove about 80 miles from metro Atlanta to Yonah Mountain, a solitary peak near the end of the Blue Ridge.

The trail was stunningly beautiful, with sunlight filtering through the canopy and boulders crowned with deep green moss. It took us more than an hour to walk up to the summit, where we looked for an opening in the foliage so we could admire the view. A path led toward an overlook above the valley, but there were no guardrails, no warning signs. This was a wild mountain, not a tourist destination, and at the end of the path was a great and terrible void. It seemed that all of life was contained on that mountaintop: the dizzying freedom, the cold touch of fear, the sense that you could do almost anything, even something catastrophic, and you were the only one who could stop you.

Part of the trail Thomas Lake was hiking in September.

We hurried down the mountain against the oncoming night. The western sky turned orange and then pale, almost white. Darkness followed, leaving us stumbling down the rocky trail, and we reached the end just after the sole of my sneaker broke apart. The children drank the last of the milk from the cooler. I felt exhausted, and also better than I'd felt in a long time.

It happened about 15 minutes later, on a winding two-lane road in the middle of nowhere. First I saw the smartphone, this white-blue rectangle waving in the dark. Then I heard a man calling for help.

Let me say this: I don't stop as much as I used to. Almost never, if I'm honest. I'll see a car on the roadside, think for a second, and then tell myself I don't want to put the children at risk. It's a convenient excuse, especially during the pandemic. Keep moving. Avoid strangers. Save yourself.

Somehow this felt different. Maybe it was the setting, the remoteness of it all, or maybe it was the sound of his voice. I stopped the van and opened my window and yelled. He appeared at the front passenger window. A young man in a white T-shirt, his mask dangling from one ear.

I rolled down the other window. What was I expecting? I don't know. Maybe a car wreck with severe injuries? Or someone having a stroke? This was nothing like that. He seemed a little drunk. He said he'd been in the car with his girlfriend, and they'd had a fight, and he'd gotten out, and now he needed a ride home.

I wished he would go away. No one outside our household had entered this vehicle in at least six months. And I had foolishly left our masks at home, believing we wouldn't need them.

I told the man we were being careful, what with the virus and all. Tried to say no without saying no. He said he was being careful too, and he had kids too, and could he please have a ride home? He kept standing in the window. Kept not going away.

It's easy to keep driving when you see a car on the shoulder. But there's something about the sight of a human face at close range. And there was no telling what misfortune might find him on a walk at night down a lonely road. I felt the heavy weight of the words of Jesus, the call to help a stranger in need.

""Okay,"" I said, and asked him to put on his mask. He did, and opened the door, and got in. I prayed a silent prayer and kept the windows open.

I asked him his name. He said it was Johnny. He said he turned 29 that day.

""Happy birthday,"" I said.

Johnny directed me to the nearest town. My hands gripped the wheel as I thought about contagion. Behind us, the children were remarkably quiet. He told me to go straight. I pointed out a sign that said DEAD END. He thought for a moment and told me to turn left. I complied, wondering where we were going.

Left, right, left. A strange town on a strange night. Johnny was mostly polite, but he did swear a lot, as some people do when they're drunk. He said he worked part-time at a restaurant and had two young children. He held up his phone and showed me a picture of his girlfriend. Then he got a call, apparently from the girlfriend. He said something angry and hung up. I kept following his directions. He said we were almost there.

Six days later, I got an email with an ominous subject line: Your COVID-19 Test Results. I'd felt sick and tired and guilty for much of the week, and my heart pounded as I clicked the link. Part of me wanted to be positive, to finally confront the monster that was stalking us all, to have the fight and survive it and just stop being afraid. I entered my date of birth and pressed the button.

Negative, it said, to my surprise, relief and confusion. Was it a false negative? Apparently not. Days passed, and my symptoms disappeared. The children seemed a little tired that week, but no one got very sick. Later in September, I took another test. Negative again. I don't know what caused my symptoms. Maybe I never will.

This I do know: The world is full of risk and wonder. It's easy to keep driving, to leave the doors closed and the windows up. I've done it again and again. This is not an invitation to pick up strangers in a deadly pandemic. But if I hadn't stopped on that lonely road, I would have missed this singular moment outside Johnny's run-down apartment complex.

""Thank you,"" he said just before departing. ""Love you.""

I hesitated for an instant, more from surprise than anything else. Men do not say these things lightly. But it was that kind of night. We were past the guardrails.

""Love you too,"" I said, and drove off with the wind rushing through the open windows."
Opinion: What the 2020 gender gap is really all about,['Opinion Jill Filipovic'],"Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book "" OK Boomer, Let's Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind ."" Follow her on Twitter . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) If current polling is any indication, the 2020 election will see an unprecedented gender gap. But the divide between female and male voting patterns isn't just about sex; it's about sexism.

One party has become the home of aggrieved men, running and electing an overwhelmingly male slate of candidates while accepting virulent misogynists and even putting one in the White House. The other is the party of a growing number of female candidates and increasingly feminist politics -- not exactly the stuff of Gloria Steinem's wildest dreams but policies that at least are intended to allow women to control their own bodies and stay economically afloat.

This polarization is as much about an embrace of appealing ideas as it is a rejection of the opposing ones. And that doesn't reflect well on American men -- or bode well for American women.

That said, voters of color still support Democrats by a much wider margin than White voters. But even among White voters, the gender dynamics are telling: CNN polls show that Biden has led among White women registered voters by an average of 13 points since April -- with Harry Enten writing that this makes for a more than 30-point gender gap among White voters compared to a 20 point gap in 2016.

Gender gaps in politics aren't new. But the breadth of this gap, and its shift in just four years, is striking.

The big question is why. Yes, Trump is a misogynist. Yes, women's economic security is increasingly under threat by a reactionary, anti-feminist Republican Party. Stripping away reproductive rights, for example, isn't just about a woman's ability to plan or end a pregnancy but about whether she can finish school, pursue her dreams and control her financial, familial and professional future.

Yes, women would benefit from the Democratic Party's platform of an increased minimum wage ( most minimum wage workers are women ) and affordable childcare (women are much more likely than men to be the primary caretakers of children). But all of this was true back in 2016, too. The Trump promise is implied by the life Trump himself lives: you can enjoy all of the benefits of a sexist culture -- the hot wife, the money, the power, the ability to belittle and degrade women -- with none of the obligations of morality or decency.

The key to understanding 2020 is perhaps the inconvenient fact that most voters don't vote on policy alone; they vote on feelings, culture and an amorphous set of highly unscientific factors. No one is entirely rational, and many people vote according to who they feel represents them, not necessarily whose platforms would best serve their interests. And sometimes, they vote against the party they feel embodies what they most oppose.

The entire ethos of ""Make America Great Again"" is about going back to a time when women largely didn't compete with men in the workforce, when marriage was culturally compulsory and when married women were largely charged with making men's lives easier: raising the children and tending to the home so that a man could go work. Under Trump, the GOP has become the party of cartoonish machismo. For a certain kind of man -- for a lot of men, apparently -- that doesn't look like chauvinism; it looks like freedom. And for a certain kind of woman -- most women, apparently -- that looks like an immediate threat that must be countered.

Almost four years of Trump have shed a brighter light on what's at stake for women.

At the same time, more is being asked of men. A paycheck is not sufficient to earn a man full-time at-home support and unquestioned partnership; women increasingly expect men to be involved fathers , supportive husbands and, because patriarchal norms aren't dead yet, at least as financially secure as we are . A lot of men can't offer all of that -- or don't believe they should have to. Women are no longer forced to settle for them.

The disruptions of Covid-19 have perhaps brought this into sharper relief, as schools shuttered and working parents were suddenly charged with homeschooling and all-day childcare. These additional at-home burdens, along with cooking, cleaning and other domestic work, have fallen largely on women . Part of the gender gap may be that mothers have long done more at-home work than fathers, and now both mothers and fathers wish their partner would do more in the midst of this crisis -- which, from a mother's point of view, would involve splitting at-home labor equally, and from a father's may look more like the traditional setup of a working dad and a stay-at-home mom.

"Why ""Over the Moon"" is the film my son and I truly needed (opinion)",['Opinion Michelle Yang'],"Michelle Yang is an advocate who writes about the intersection of Asian American identity, feminism, and mental health. Her writing has appeared in InStyle, Reader's Digest, Parents, HuffPost, and more. The views expressed here are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) Early in the lockdown, my 6-year-old was on his scooter zipping away in front of me on our quiet Seattle neighborhood street when I sensed a car coming from behind. I called out for my child to stop, but under his bright helmet painted with a cartoon lion, he couldn't hear me.

I expected the car to slow, but instead, it sped up. I screamed, helpless. Any parent would be scared, but news headlines about hate crimes against Asian Americans during the Covid-19 pandemic rushed through my mind, flashing images of seniors assaulted and children stabbed at a store.

Luckily for us, the car stopped in time, but it was far too close for comfort. Was it a threat, a joke, or simply bad driving? I would never know. But that incident was the last time our only child was allowed on a scooter for months. Our family decided afterward that it would be unsafe for our son and me to be out without a second adult, further isolating ourselves in an already lonely time.

It's so hard for me to feel hopeful during these times, but a new movie, ""Over the Moon"" has given me hope and a way to celebrate my heritage with family. I am a Chinese American who emigrated as a child and worked at our family's takeout restaurant starting when I could barely see over the counter. Though I struggled in those early years of transition after immigration, I've not seen anything like the level of hatred currently directed toward Asians. According to Stop AAPI Hate , a national reporting center formed to track and respond to incidents of hate and discrimination spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic, in recent months ""Over 80% of Asian American youth report being bullied or verbally harassed.""

This finding is unsurprising when the President and other leaders continue to blame China for the coronavirus, using hateful rhetoric that rings like playground taunts. Hate as a rallying call is chilling, especially when you know it's working, when you know children are listening. With such dire statistics and rhetoric adding to my anxiety, I have struggled to protect my child physically and mentally. My son is very aware of racism, having been taught about anti-racism since preschool, and he knows that his mama is worried.

Along with the added physical safety measures, I have an increased and urgent desire to cultivate my child's pride in his Chinese heritage. However, the pandemic has made it nearly impossible to build cultural connections in the ways our family did in the past. We can no longer bus to Seattle's International District to soak up the festive atmosphere. We miss being immersed in the hustle and bustle of dim sum rushes and watching our little one eat his weight in dumplings. We can't visit extended family out-of-state, let alone travel out of the country.

So what is a conscientious parent to do? What can we do to foster pride in our Chinese heritage during a pandemic that has been distinctly anti-Asian?

This Mid-Autumn Festival season, a holiday like Thanksgiving where loved ones reunite over a feast under a harvest moon, help comes from an unexpected source, a Netflix original available this week. Until I watched "" Over the Moon ,"" I didn't know how much I needed it, in this period when I feel pressured to downplay my Asian-ness, however futile and wrong it is.

Since the pandemic began, I haven't been able to bring myself to wear my favorite ""It's an honor just to be Asian"" T-shirt quoting Sandra Oh. Though I'm proud as ever to be Asian American, I do not want to give ammunition to racists while exposed in public and I'm angry at myself for feeling afraid. So in these somber times, ""Over the Moon"" prompted in me a quiet rejoicing.

The story introduces the audience — then takes them beyond — the Chinese myth of the Moon Goddess, a woman named Chang'e who drinks an immortality elixir awarded to her hero husband by the gods, and floats up to the moon for all eternity. This myth inspired the Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the Moon Festival, which honors Chang'e's sacrifice.

Skillful animation by legendary animator and director Glen Keane (""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Aladdin"") breathes life into endearing characters voiced by a talented all-Asian cast. Newcomer Cathy Ang headlines as Fei-Fei, the precocious 12-year-old protagonist, with Phillipa Soo of ""Hamilton"" fame as Chang'e the Moon Goddess, supported by an ensemble cast of Ken Jeong, John Cho, Margaret Cho, Sandra Oh, and more. During our at-home, prescreening offered by Netflix — one of the perks of having a writer mama — my 7-year-old was enraptured from the opening scene.

Set in a picturesque canal city in China with carved stone bridges over waterways, the film offered a peek into the thrill of what it was like to revel in the festival before I emigrated. Fei-Fei's family feasts on delectable dishes with boisterous relatives squeezed around a round table, under a full moon. I remember eating fresh mooncakes as a child and learning that everything is round to symbolize unity and coming together. I loved seeing my child's face light up at the scenes of family celebrations, especially because we couldn't host a crowded dinner of our own.

Fei-Fei builds a rocket to the moon to prove the existence of the Moon Goddess to her father. She fights to hold tight to the stories and memories of her mother, who died four years earlier. ""Over the Moon"" is the final work of screenwriter Audrey Wells, who passed away from cancer in 2018. Through this film, she relayed to her husband and daughter that it was OK to love again, that love, while not immortal, can still be eternal.

For me, an Asian American mental-health advocate, I find the nuanced representations of Chinese mythology and culture in ""Over the Moon"" reason for optimism. I was taught since childhood that suffering is a venerable requisite in life, that there is honor in embracing one's bitter fate. In modern retelling of ""Over the Moon"" — in which Chang'e, along with Fei-Fei and her father, finds freedom — is revolutionary in allowing its characters to quest for happiness beyond loyalty to the deceased. ""Over the Moon"" is a family movie that reinforces the message that we need not swallow bitterness; instead, we can change our fate.

The film ambitiously balances tradition and progress. It teaches us to champion heritage while evolving beyond the rules that hold us back. I recognized in some recent comments from cast member John Cho one of the reasons this film is so powerful for my son and me — it represents an Asian family on their own terms, not as bound up in oppression or shame or forced duty. It's about love.

Most other representations of Asian culture and family demonstrate, by contrast, how dehumanizing it is to paint billions of people with the same brush. I'm curious how this film will perform worldwide. I wonder if ""Over the Moon"" will be too Chinese for Western audiences while simultaneously too Western in its theme and philosophy for Eastern ones. Or perhaps this push and pull is exactly why it will appeal to so many people like me who grew up caught in between cultures, who forged our own way.

Americans are facing not only a Covid-19 pandemic but an epidemic of heightened racism against Asians. The potential power of the film's release during a time when some of our country's top leaders model hate as a winning strategy is noteworthy. We need this film, this small antidote, to shield our children and ourselves, to challenge harmful stereotypes about Chinese people and instill cultural pride."
James Meredith: I am George Floyd,['Opinion James Meredith With William Doyle'],"James Meredith is a US Air Force veteran, the first black graduate of the University of Mississippi, and the author of "" Three Years in Mississippi "" and the memoir, "" A Mission from God ,"" written with William Doyle. Twenty-five years ago, when Doyle read the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's "" Letter From Birmingham Jail ,"" he was struck by the passage, ""One day the South will recognize its real heroes. They will be the James Merediths, courageously and with a majestic sense of purpose facing jeering and hostile mobs and the agonizing loneliness that characterizes the life of the pioneer."" He sought out Meredith and the two have been discussing American history and race relations ever since. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the authors. View more opinions at CNN.

(CNN) The death of George Floyd last month set us on an entirely new path of history. Perhaps it will lead to the beast of white supremacy, which has cursed this nation since before its history began, finally being conquered.

Black people have always known how powerful and dangerous white supremacy is, but now the entire world is on the march , saying: We're not going to take it anymore. This may be the greatest thing to ever happen to America, and I think it will change the destiny of our nation for the better.

When I was a boy, my father told me that I was on a mission from God to destroy the system of white supremacy and to uplift black and brown people to their proper position. I took his challenge very seriously.

In 1961, as a 28-year-old Air Force veteran of the desegregated military, I sued the state of Mississippi, which was at that time a neo-Confederate, terrorist police state, for the right to get my education at the University of Mississippi. I forced the President of the United States and the Supreme Court to back my rights as an American citizen, and the federal courts ordered me into the university.

In response, the state of Mississippi rebelled and started an insurrection, blocked me and my federal escorts from entering the school, and became a breakaway republic on the issue of race.

President John F. Kennedy sent in thousands of combat troops to crush the rebellion, and the gates of higher education in the United States were opened for all Americans. This victory for me and for the US Constitution shattered the system of state-sponsored white supremacy in Mississippi.

In 1966, while a student at Columbia University Law School, I began a one-man "" March Against Fear "" through Mississippi to inspire black people to vote. On Day Two, I was shot by a sniper, filling my body with pellets that remain under my skin today. Martin Luther King Jr. and the leaders of the civil rights movement came to Mississippi and took up the march, which attracted thousands of people and inspired thousands more to vote.

Federal voting registrars followed in force. There was no turning back. The floodgates of voter registration were opened for all Americans.

Over the years I've made speeches, traveled the world, written books, opened and closed businesses, been a liberal, a conservative, a farmer, husband, father and grandfather. In 2002, I watched with pride as my son Joseph received the Outstanding Doctoral Student Achievement Award at the University of Mississippi business school.

In 2013 I was awarded the Harvard Graduate School of Education Medal for Education Impact, the highest honor given by the school.

And I'm still here, still alive, still going strong, still taking a power walk every day, even through the pandemic.

But when I see people across America -- and around the world -- peacefully marching for racial justice and honoring the memory of George Floyd and other martyrs like Medgar Evers, my best friend and brother-figure from so long ago, I am filled with both joy and hope.

White supremacy may be the most evil beast that's ever stalked the halls of history, and today it may finally be mortally wounded. This happened for two reasons. For the first and only time in my life, society was shut down by a pandemic, which prepared the people for an explosion. And then the video of Floyd's death was seen by countless people the world over. Without that video, white supremacy in America might have remained nearly as powerful as it's ever been for the past 500 years.

That video, you see, reveals what my life is all about. I am George Floyd. As a black man growing up in Mississippi in the mid-20th century, I was stripped of all the rights of American citizenship. I was subject to being beaten, tortured or lynched at any moment by a white person who had little reason to fear punishment. I've devoted my life to destroying that reality, and to the idea of honoring the full citizenship rights of every American.

Today, black and brown people are inspiring the world with their strength, determination, and willingness to see the struggle through to total victory.

I believe that this global uprising will never stop, and it will move into every heart, home and community on Earth, until the day when all people are treated with the dignity, respect and love that God intends for us. I believe that on that day, white supremacy will finally be buried forever."
St. Paul mayor: We need this in our toolkit for policing,['Opinion Melvin Carter'],"Melvin Carter is the first African American Mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinions on CNN.

(CNN) For too long, Americans have bought into the myth that public safety is a simple function of police, prisons and prosecutors. Consequently, we spend nearly $200 billion on law enforcement and corrections annually.

We maintain the highest imprisonment rate on the planet, as the United States is home to less than 5% of the world's population, but 20% of the global prison population , according to the Prison Policy Initiative.

Melvin Carter

The reason is clear: Our country's enforcement-heavy approach to safety isn't designed to address the root causes of crime, but the symptoms. Instead of equipping us all with tools to guard our own future security, it further alienates those on the outer edges of society and impedes funding for critical social infrastructure like schools and housing.

Further, it fosters resentment toward police, who are empowered to exert deadly force but lack capacity and expertise to serve as the social workers, grief counselors or chemical and mental health professionals who could help stabilize our highest potential communities."

(CNN) Like many brown and black skinned children in this country I was raised to dream big and aim high ... just with a caveat. Whatever I thought it would take to accomplish my goals, I would have to work harder and be better. That message was internalized so early on in childhood, that although I can recall questioning its fairness, I never questioned its truth. It was in fact self-evident.

And so I set about playing the game. I got used to classrooms, lecture halls, and then conference rooms where few people looked like me. I understood the power of privilege, and believed that by gaining economic security, a professional network, and strong reputation one could secure a platform. And I believed that from that platform you would be seen and heard.

So I hung the degrees and dressed the part of a doctor every day. I diligently cared for my patients and I built community with my colleagues. I was careful with my words and actions ... too careful really, all the while painfully aware of the ease with which I could be labeled ""angry,"" ""defensive"" or ""confrontational.""

Six months ago while at an academic meeting, I gathered with colleagues at the end of a long day. Several minutes into the conversation I found myself exhale and relax. I felt so much myself, that during a round of sharing stories of mistaken identities, I shared my own.

In the last month, I told them, I had been mistaken for a member of the custodial staff, food services, patient transport, and interpreter services, all the while dressed the part of a doctor. A colleague leaned over to me and said, ""I had no idea you were so ..."". He trailed off before ending the sentence, and although curious, I let it go. Whatever the word, of course he didn't know. How could he? In an effort to work harder and be better, to fit the mold and gain a platform, I had unconsciously (or consciously) stopped bringing my whole self to work.

Should we give a damn about the Oxford comma?,['John Mcwhorter'],"Story highlights A judge recently ruled in favor of Maine truckers because of a missing Oxford comma

John McWhorter: Oxford commas ward off ambiguity, but need not be used all the time

John McWhorter teaches linguistics, American studies, philosophy and music history at Columbia University and is the author of ""Words on the Move."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) A recent court case seems like a victory for fans of the grand old Oxford comma. To many, it feels natural to write ""Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Cleveland."" But just as one may feel lazy saying ""My brother and me went home"" rather than ""My brother and I,"" there is a sense that it is more proper to write ""Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Cleveland,"" inserting a comma after the item before the last one.

And people advocating for the Oxford comma have a point now and then. If you were a trucker reading that union rules deny you overtime pay for ""the canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution of agricultural produce,"" would you consider yourself due overtime payment nevertheless for distribution? That is, as opposed to packing things for shipping and distribution?

John McWhorter

Truckers for Oakhurst Dairy in Maine have been granted back overtime pay for having distributed product as opposed to packing it, because though the writers of the contract meant that overtime would not be granted for distribution either, this is not clear when there is no comma after shipment. The drivers' lawyer has successfully argued that the contract appears to stipulate that overtime won't be granted for, only, the packing of things for future shipping and distribution.

But it's premature to read this as demonstrating that everybody should always use the Oxford comma. What happened here shows, just as defensibly, that the Oxford comma should be used in cases of potential ambiguity. The people who wrote the union contract made a mistake, but not in way that means all of us should feel bad about writing ""hamburgers, hot dogs and French fries.""

We might feel slovenly, however, for writing ""I had toast, bacon and eggs and coffee"" where one could argue that it's unclear whether the bacon and eggs went together or eggs and coffee did, or ""My parents, Mother Teresa and the Pope,"" which implies a rather stunning parental history in casting those two people as your parents, as opposed to persons in sequence with your parents.

Welcome to the Fractured States of America,['Yaffa Fredrick'],"Christine M. says that her stepfather canceled his plane ticket to her wedding in Utah because of their political differences (she’s anti-President Donald Trump, he’s pro). Justin M. won’t wear his MAGA hat in his hometown of Boston for fear he’ll be humiliated. Richard G., an independent who lives in the Tampa area, put a “No Politics Zone” sign on his door after several Trump-supporting coworkers challenged him over the latest political headlines.

Mario Benavente, a North Carolina Republican, puts it simply: “Political debate right now is a blood sport.”

These folks are only a snapshot of the reality facing Americans today. Many parents no longer want their children marrying people from a different political party — 35% of Republicans and 45% of Democrats, to be precise. Workers, like Richard, feel politics simply has no place in the office. And Americans at large dread the idea of Thanksgiving dinners with family members who might bring up President Donald Trump. Some on the right are even concerned we are on the verge of a new Civil War.

“Political debate right now is a blood sport.” – Mario Benavente, a North Carolina Republican

In 2019, there’s only one thing that unites us: just how divided we think we are. In fact, according to the Public Religion Research Institute, 91% of Americans feel we are polarized — and 74% feel we are extremely polarized.

Welcome to the Fractured States of America. In this series, over the next three weeks, we’ll explore the new landscape of a polarized America and examine ways to get beyond it, with the help of frequent CNN Opinion contributors and many new voices, including those of our readers.

The harm it’s causing

Politics is now a major source of stress for Americans. According to Pew Research Center, almost 50% of Republicans and nearly 60% of Democrats say discussing partisan issues — be they abortion, immigration or gun control — can be “stressful and frustrating.” And increased levels of stress are often linked to increased risks of chest pain, headache and sleeping problems. Not surprisingly, then, many Americans have also reported losing sleep and experiencing bouts of depression because of political tensions.

But it gets worse. Political division increases the risk of violence. As people begin to identify with one party or another, they isolate themselves and can become more extreme in their views. According to data from two national surveys, 15% of self-identifying Republicans and 20% of self-identifying Democrats think the country would be better if members of the opposing party “just died.” And almost 10% of people who identify as members of both major parties think violence would be acceptable if the opposing party’s candidate won the next presidential election. While these individuals represent a minority of surveyed participants, the fact that any voters are thinking in these terms is cause for alarm.

We’ve been here before

Of course, this is not the first time this country has experienced political division. At the founding of the United States, America’s first president, George Washington, warned of the dangers of partisanship — stating in his Farewell Address, “It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and … foments occasionally riot and insurrection.”

Watch: John Avlon on the problem with polarization

And his fears came to a frightening reality less than 100 years later when the issue of slavery led to the outbreak of the Civil War. The US lost 750,000 lives in that war, or approximately 2% of its population. But the end of the war in 1865 did not spell a unified vision for the future.

From the Great Depression to the Vietnam War, the 20th century was marked by periods of division over economic inequality, political ideology and the use of military force. However, as documentary filmmaker Ken Burns explains to CNN, “the essential thing about history, though it catalogs so many injustices and indignities, is that it always shows us that particularly the American example moves back to the center.”

For now, though, the pendulum appears to have swung toward the extremes.

How we got here

Just pause for a moment and think about the town or city you call home. How many of your neighbors voted the same way you did in the last presidential election cycle? Probably most of them. And if they didn’t, research indicates you may be considering relocating sometime soon.

Just 40 years ago, most districts in the US were swing districts. Today, less than half of them are. And this is unlikely to change anytime soon, as more and more people move to neighborhoods where they likely won’t encounter anyone who holds an opposing political view.

So, what happened over the last four decades? Journalist Bill Bishop explains we’ve been self-sorting ourselves since the 1970s, when geographic inequality in education grew. That meant Americans with college degrees began clustering in big cities, while less-educated people remained in more rural areas. And jobs migrated accordingly, with technology and production following the new city dwellers.

This clustering was followed by the rise of partisan media, social media networks and a market that was built quite literally on catering to those divisions. In other words, entire identities — defined by diet, media patterns and size of home — have been created around party affiliation. And, as sociological research explains, place, and even consumption habits, have become a way of creating identity and broadcasting it to the world — or, at least, our closest neighbor.

The dangers of self-sorting

There is an inherent danger in this form of identity politicking — it’s isolating and pushes people into their respective political tribes. In these tribes, they are not forced to rigorously interrogate their belief systems.

Identifying with our tribes isn’t inherently bad, notes SE Cupp. “Tribalism, after all, is part of our evolutionary DNA. The need to identify with a group, to belong and commune with like-minded people is not only biological, it’s what has helped motivate our desire for and devotion to all kinds of important cultural institutions, from organized religion to sports fandom.”

What isn’t natural, she says, is the increased importance we attach to politics, or the rigid allegiance to a specific political tribe — and the misperceptions of the other side that accompany it.

“Tribalism, after all, is part of our evolutionary DNA.” – SE Cupp, host of “SE Cupp Unfiltered”

So much of our division, or our perceived level of discomfort with the opposing party, is imagined. For many liberals, listening to a Ted Cruz speech is seen as nails on a chalkboard, or slightly less painful than a root canal. And for conservatives, the same might be said about Bernie Sanders. Yet Harvard researchers found that the negative anticipation both sides had about these experiences far exceeded the result. When forced to listen to Cruz and Sanders, both groups said it was much more tolerable than they expected.

But it’s hard for liberals, conservatives and even independents — who research suggests usually have partisan leanings — to realize this because they live in their echo chambers, which often reinforce their existing beliefs and make them even more polarized. All of this comes at a cost — creating a massive perception gap between what Americans suspect their political opponents think and what the reality is.

The other cost? Awkward family gatherings — be it for the holidays, weddings or funerals. People feel increasingly uncomfortable around their Fox News-loving grandfather or their New York Times-subscribing granddaughter. And research indicates the solution to this is simply to not engage in political debate. Stick to sports or the weather. But do not mention the White House or its current inhabitant.

But there is some good news

Most Americans are not hyper-partisans. They comprise the “exhausted majority,” writes scholar Daniel Yudkin. They are flexible in their politics and open to compromise — especially if that means advancing legislation on issues like gun reform.

And there may be a way to re-engage them in the political process. Deborah Fallows recommends starting on the local level. While our national government may seem paralyzed most days, towns — big and small — “are often and strongly acting in a united way, facing their problems, negotiating their solutions and taking action for the greater good of their communities,” she says.

The reason is pretty simple. At the local level, people recognize the bucks stop with them — and they cannot wait for someone else to “save” them. If a school is failing, if a bridge is breaking, they are the ones who can move quickest to address the situation.

Ken Burns has another idea — share stories. “We all have stories. And sometimes they lead us back to emotions and feelings we have in common,” he explains. That may require breaking out of our red and blue silos and actually grabbing beers (Coors is the preferred drink of both parties!) with someone of a different political persuasion.

But it also involves having a frank discussion of what our core American values are.

“We all have stories. And sometimes they lead us back to emotions and feelings we have in common.” – Ken Burns, American filmmaker

What are our core values

At the “Looking For America” dinner organized by New American Economy, American University School of Public Affairs and Curiosity Connects at the El Paso Museum of History, guests were asked to bring an item that illustrates their connection to their community.

Andrea Beltran, a liberal leaning writer and poet, shared her great-grandmother's 1920 nonresident alien border crossing card, containing the only photo Beltran has of the family matriarch. She explained that the card represents the idea of identity “being something hard to locate and even harder to define.” In this climate of what she calls “heavy patriotism and nationalism,” her great-grandmother reminds her just how complicated, and perhaps even dangerous, it can be to define who is and who is not American simply on the basis of birth.

Andrea Beltran holds a copy of her great-grandmother's 1920 nonresident alien border crossing card. Photo by Patrick Craig.

John Moye, a moderate Republican and development manager for the Housing Authority, brought a 1944 El Paso Times newspaper article, which recounted his father’s experience as a prisoner of war in then-Nazi Germany. His father, who enlisted in the military the day after Pearl Harbor, survived 10 months as a POW before eventually returning to Texas. Moye emphasized that the article shows how much people at the height of World War II ""truly gave of themselves and asked for little in return,"" a kind of patriotism he worries Americans are now losing.

John Moye holds 1944 El Paso Times newspaper clipping, telling the story of his father, who was taken as a prisoner of war during World War II. Photo by Patrick Craig.

Though Beltran and Moye are lifelong El Pasoans with strong connections to the city they call home, their items of choice reflect their different perspectives on this country’s fundamental values. Beltran chose the nonresident card to emphasize the complexity, but also beauty of American identity. It’s not singular — it’s messy, multilingual and built on the backs of immigrants. And trying to narrowly define it hurts us as a nation.

Moye used the newspaper clipping to showcase the importance of having a clear national identity and parlaying that into sacrifice for one’s country. His choice reflects a nostalgia for a different time, and perhaps even generation, when duty to country came first. Back then, Americans were united around a common cause — and had a strong sense of community. These days, for so many, both cause and community hang in the balance, he says.

Beltran and Moye’s differences on what American national identity should or could be is just one example of the fractured state of America. But their ability to break bread together also offers a ray of hope — one that is premised on the notion that the US is stronger because of its diversity of views, rather than its uniform acceptance of any one ideology.

As Beltran phrased it, “the best thing about this dinner was it reminded me of the human connection.” Moye seconded her, noting that though he disagreed with some of Beltran’s views, he was so grateful “that a space was finally created for these kinds of tough conversations. This country needs more of them.”"
Asheville's woes are the story of America,['Opinion David Daley'],"David Daley is the author of "" Ratf**ked: Why Your Vote Doesn't Count ."" His work has appeared in the New Yorker, Atlantic and Washington Post, among other publications. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) If you want to understand how American politics has become more polarized and extreme over the last decade, look no farther than Asheville, North Carolina -- now split between two of the most gerrymandered districts in the country.

Artists, independent spirits and environmentalists have traditionally flocked to this hippie enclave, surrounded by conservative hill towns, for the majestic Blue Ridge Mountains, thriving local brewpubs, vegan cafes and independent bookstores.

And, a decade ago, North Carolina's 11th congressional district, with Asheville at its heart, was among the nation's most competitive, see-sawing with shifting political winds. It favored Republicans during the two elections that followed the September 11 attacks, then veered toward Democrats beginning in 2006 as the Iraq war stagnated and stock market tumbled.

This district does not swing any longer. Asheville is now represented by two of the most conservative members of Congress , including the outgoing chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, who have won their races since 2012 by double-digit averages

Why? Because while the old map preserved Asheville in one competitive district, the new one sliced the city in half, scattering its voters across two districts in a way that ensured a Republican captured both seats.

But when the 11th district switched from a toss-up to safely Republican, the entire political dynamic changed. Without a competitive general election, the real action moved to the GOP primary, where turnout tends to be lower, and limited to the activist base. Only the most ideological extreme candidates stood a chance.

Not surprisingly, many locals are unhappy with this reality. ""The majority of the electorate in Asheville feels that their views are not represented in Congress,"" Mayor Esther Manheimer said in March . The matter is not settled; judges recently blocked the congressional map from being used in 2020 elections.

Of course, this story is not unique to Asheville. All over the country, partisans have cracked cities in two, drawn districts that look like Donald Duck kicking Goofy and exploited new technology and advanced data to maximize gains.

And the consequences for democracy continue to be catastrophic, locking in a new era of minority rule across multiple states, distorting the competitive balance of congressional delegations and placing public policy -- and many politicians -- beyond the reach of the ballot box.

But which came first: the extreme gerrymanders or the heightened polarization? The reality is that each acts as an accelerant on the other, exacerbating a situation these politicians candidly describe in amicus briefs before the US Supreme Court as a Montague vs. Capulet-styled Shakespearean bloodbath.

Gerrymandered districts have also helped create an epidemic of minority rule nationwide, driving state politics to extremes not supported by voters who find themselves unable to do anything about it.

Almost 60 million Americans live in a state where one or both chambers of legislature is controlled by the party that won fewer statewide votes in the 2018 election. A new study finds that with fair lines, 59 congressional seats would have changed hands in 2012, 2014 and 2016. (Republicans gained 39 seats they would not have won; Democrats secured 20.)

Of course, gerrymandering has been part of our politics from the start . The bad news for democracy is that we're better at gerrymandering than ever before. Powerful computers , sophisticated mapping software and terabytes of voter, census and consumer data -- alongside growing polarization -- make it possible to draw surgical district lines that provide sturdy bulwarks against electoral waves and maximize partisan advantage across an entire state.

It's more than geography: Multiple academic studies, involving tens of thousands of neutral maps, consistently show that the partisan-drawn maps in the most gerrymandered states are radical outliers.

Neither political party has more historical virtue when it comes to gerrymandering, but GOP strategists outplayed their DNC counterparts ahead of the 2010 election, recognizing that redistricting provided a path back to power after the party's 2008 walloping at the hands of President Barack Obama.

In fact, the GOP invested $30 million into state legislative races in closely divided states like Ohio, Wisconsin and North Carolina, seeking to win full control of congressional and state legislative maps. The lines Republicans drew the following year stuck.

It was a political masterstroke: Every 10 years, following the census, congressional lines are redrawn to account for population changes. In most states, the state legislature takes the lead, so the GOP's modest investment paid handsome dividends. (As a result, Democrats controlled the process in fewer states than Republicans, so they lacked the same opportunities to gerrymander in 2010. They did take full advantage of their biggest opportunity, drawing a map that pushed their advantage in Maryland all the way to 7-1.)

But most Americans vote in uncompetitive districts, where the outcome is pre-ordained and reflective of only the most partisan extremes. Uncompetitive districts elect a different kind of politician, who is then incentivized to cater only to their base.

Missouri, It doesn't have to be this way. Americans hate gerrymandering and believe in fair elections, evident by the various initiatives and constitutional amendments that passed in 2018, including successful efforts to stop politicians from drawing their own districts and choosing their own voters in Michigan Colorado, Ohio and Utah

Many of our national divisions are real and difficult to bridge. Gerrymandering, however, is self-inflicted. We've done this to ourselves -- but we can undo it, too."

(CNN) In this era of extreme political division, one issue is bringing people together: the need to invest in public safety solutions that reduce crime and make the criminal justice system fairer.

For the first time in my life, it appears every presidential candidate is running as a champion of criminal justice reform -- including (to the shock of many) Donald J. Trump . It is an astonishing reversal in both political parties. For decades, ambitious politicians tried to outdo each other with ""lock 'em up"" policies and ""tough-on-crime"" rhetoric.

This dynamic accelerated after George H.W. Bush crushed Massachusetts Democrat Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential race. Popular wisdom attributed the win to television ads spotlighting a prisoner named Willie Horton , who committed heinous crimes while part of Dukakis' prison furlough program. Afterward, generations of politicians were afraid to champion prison reform.

So, how did justice reform emerge as the one cause that brings people together? The answers are complicated -- and surprising.

I have a special perspective on the topic. In California, the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights , which I co-founded in 1996, helped to close five abusive youth prisons; we also blocked construction of a draconian ""super jail for youth"" near Oakland. Five years ago, I co-founded the Dream Corps' #cut50 campaign with Jessica Jackson and Matt Haney, through which we passed more than a dozen bipartisan criminal justice bills at the state level, plus last year's federal First Step Act . This year, I helped launch the REFORM Alliance , which aims to shrink and transform the probation and parole systems.

I have dedicated my life to this cause. But I have never seen anything like 2019 -- a year in which all presidential candidates and both parties are fighting over who can be trusted to put fewer people behind bars while reducing crime.

The magic moment

Any shift of this magnitude has many causes. Let's explore the top five:

1. The trifecta

Finally, lawmakers eventually got frustrated investing billions into a system that was failing to rehabilitate a majority of people who came into contact with it. Incarceration fatigue opened the door to new ways of thinking about crime prevention that address underlying causes -- like mental health, drugs, trauma, etc. And so leaders began shifting resources to create specialty courts -- veterans courts, drug courts, mental health courts -- across the country.

2. Culture shift

The television series, ""Orange is the New Black,"" brought binge-watching Americans inside the lives of women living behind bars. Ava DuVernay's explosive documentary, ""The 13th,"" and Netflix series, ""When They See Us,"" broke hearts. Other documentaries and podcasts, from ""Time: The Kalief Browder Story"" to ""Serial,"" opened the public's eyes

Authors like Michelle Alexander and Bryan Stevenson shook the consciences of those who read their works. Shaka Senghor's bestselling book, ""Writing My Wrongs,"" won the admiration of Oprah Winfrey and helped to open the floodgates for formerly incarcerated authors. And in recent years, household names like Common, John Legend, Alicia Keys and Kim Kardashian have become outspoken advocates.

This wave of popular media pushed into mainstream living rooms and reached beyond the pool of those who once paid attention to the incarceration system. It is now common knowledge that the United States, shamefully, has the highest incarceration rate in the world.

3. Democratic value: Justice

Many people assume that Democrats always opposed mass incarceration. That is a myth. Democrats overwhelmingly backed President Bill Clinton's disastrous 1994 crime bill. The deep blue state of California just recently began to dig itself out of an incarceration crisis that resulted in the construction of more than 20 prisons but only one university in the past generation. And the national Democratic Party's platform carefully excluded any reference to criminal justice reform until 2016

So, what changed? Many things -- from #BlackLivesMatter to the opioid crisis

Seeing African American communities devastated by decades of overpolicing and excessive incarceration, a new generation of black activists rebelled. Starting in 2013, they demanded that Democrats address head-on the issues of racist police abuse and racial bias in the justice system. Their passion gave more political room for traditional civil rights and civil liberties organizations to accelerate their own longstanding reform efforts.

Pushed past the breaking point, the incarceration generation rose up and insisted that Democrats speak out boldly against the racial injustice in the system. Today, all Democrats echo their call. The protests that started in 2013 have yielded a Democratic Party today that is more firmly grounded in its core ideals of racial, gender and social justice.

But Democrats also know the Republicans aren't going to ""Willie Horton"" them, since so many conservatives are also embracing the cause.

4. Republican value: Liberty

their own Many on the left doubt the sincerity of criminal justice reformers on the right. They can't believe that Republicans would truly care about a ""racial justice"" issue. But the truth is that Republicans have reasons to oppose the incarceration industry.

Republicans care a lot about public safety. But the ""tough on crime"" system made many communities less safe . Today, many conservatives want an evidence-based system that focuses on reducing crime. They've returned to principles that resonate deeply on the right as they joined the fight for reform.

Another conservative principle is the desire for transparency, accountability and limits on government overreach. Libertarians especially don't want the government to have too much power over individual lives. The Koch brothers fall into this category. So do US Sens. Mike Lee and Rand Paul and advocacy groups like FreedomWorks.

Yet another conservative value is the faith-based belief in human dignity. Religious conservatives, including Newt Gingrich, worry the present system leaves no real opportunity for second chances or personal redemption. When he was the Republican governor of Mississippi, Phil Bryant explicitly cited his Christian faith as the source of his passion for prison reform

Black pro-Trump conservatives like Candace Owens and Katrina Pierson are working to return a pro-Lincoln, pro-freedom ethic inside the GOP on this issue.

5. The Trump factor

Then there is the most surprising plot twist of all: Trump's decision to release Alice Johnson . The world watched as Johnson, a 63-year-old grandmother who had been sentenced to die in prison, ran across the road into her family's arms. We began to hear the President shift from describing himself as ""tough on crime"" to expressing that he's tough but fair and recognizing the disproportionate sentencing in the justice system. Surrounded by law enforcement, faith leaders, Republican members and even several Democrats, Trump then endorsed adding sentencing reform to the First Step Act, which he signed into law later that year.

Because many red state governors took the lead , this Republican President could engage on criminal justice reform without risking his base. More importantly, key people in Trump's inner circle -- including his son-in-law, Jared Kushner -- were strong allies. This opened the door for formerly incarcerated people (on the left and right) to make repeated visits to the White House, sharing their experiences with senior officials of how the existing system failed them.

People on both sides of the aisle should be glad that Trump decided to adopt the cause -- and not crush it. Criminal justice reform could have fallen into a divisive stalemate like guns, climate or immigration. Instead, Trump's decision to embrace criminal justice reform has set Republicans free to work with Democrats. That's a good thing for both parties -- and a very good thing for the people suffering behind bars.

Lessons beyond criminal justice

I've spent time in red states, blue states, Appalachia and urban neighborhoods. I see the same problems everywhere: generational poverty, addiction, underperforming schools, lack of access to mental health services and a broken criminal justice system. Neither party has been able to make a real dent in these problems facing low-income communities.

The sad truth is that Republicans get a lot of votes from poor, rural communities -- but have failed to sufficiently improve conditions or expand opportunity there. Democrats get a lot of votes from poor, urban communities -- but we have failed to sufficiently improve conditions or expand opportunity there. That's why I came to believe in bottom-up bipartisanship -- centered on addressing the pain of the people at the bottom in both parties.

However, here is what I know: Change is possible -- and criminal justice reform is evidence of that. As recently as 2014, the idea of ""bipartisan criminal justice reform"" was an oxymoron. Now it is almost a cliché. And, symbolically, Alice Johnson has replaced Willie Horton as the iconic image of a formerly incarcerated person.

When I started 25 years ago, politicians in both parties promised to lock up more people, treat them more harshly and keep them behind bars longer. Today, leaders in both parties say we should lock up fewer people, help them transform their lives and send them home better, not bitter.

Criminal justice reform is renewing the right's dedication to individual ""liberty"" and deepening the left's commitment to social ""justice."" As a result, we still have a chance to build a country with ""liberty"" and ""justice"" for all."

(CNN) I am a political activist by nature. In my home country of Brazil, I helped organize peaceful protests against government corruption and abuses of power. At the time -- way back in 2013 -- Brazil was plagued by scandal, with much of the population living in poverty. And yet the country's politicians, the source of so much of the scandal, continued to push agendas that benefited themselves and few others.

Julia Song

But with excessive spending on the World Cup draining the country's already depleted resources, I was able to find a path forward with Brazilians from across the political spectrum. Our collective protests helped lead to a government investigation into corruption. Ultimately, many politicians went to prison , and the country's president -- Dilma Rousseff -- was impeached

Shortly after the protests, I moved to the United States on a family visa, where I was granted temporary residency, allowing me the right to work. I then began a four-year-long process to gain full citizenship, navigating the complexities and the financial costs of the American immigration bureaucracy.

Arriving to this new country, I thought that my activism days were behind me. But then I noticed a growing political divide between the elites, or establishment politicians, and working-class Americans just trying to get by. Sensing the disconnect -- and the growing power of the political elite -- I began using the power of social media to raise awareness of the issue, first on Instagram, and then on Twitter.

I advocated for my belief in a smaller government that guarantees more individual freedoms -- and allows everyday Americans a chance at success. If you haven't guessed yet, I'm a Republican, and I support President Donald Trump's emphasis on fighting for ordinary Americans.

SE Cupp: A third party could get us out of this mess,['Opinion Se Cupp'],"SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and the host of "" SE Cupp Unfiltered ."" The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) In an NBC/WSJ poll earlier this year, only 1 in 10 adults agreed that the two-party system in this country was working fairly well.

This means that both parties are leaving a lot to be desired, according to voters, and many are coming to see the radical need for an alternative. In fact, 38% of respondents said the country needs a third party, the highest number who have said so since this poll began tracking the question in 1995.

And a third party that makes it its raison d'etre to represent the rest of the electorate might get a good look by voters in this environment.

Contributing to the need for an alternative party is the feeling that politics is dividing us up -- and leaving a lot of us out. And the choices we're usually left with, Republican or Democrat, aren't good enough.

The immigration disconnect

Just take this example from one of the early Democratic primary debates in June, when candidates were asked whether they supported decriminalizing our borders --that is, repealing Section 1325 of Title 8 of the US Code, which makes crossing the border without official inspection a misdemeanor offense.

As of an August tally by Politico, 14 Democratic candidates, some of whom are no longer in the running, had supported decriminalizing the border. For many progressive voters, the idea likely seemed necessary. After all, President Donald Trump was using the statute to detain and separate asylum-seeking families at the border.

Dem Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez tweeted : ""Border policy: As @JulianCastro mentioned in the #DemDebate, it's time to repeal Section 1325 & 1326, the statutes this admin is using to mindlessly throw people in cages. We have to take these proceedings out of criminal code and into civil code. Torture accomplishes nothing.""

What made the moment astonishing for anyone remotely in touch with voters -- or who had read recent polls -- was that this idea was far outside the mainstream. What many saw as simply ending the mechanism to determine whether immigration was legal or illegal is not popular.

According to an NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist poll among registered voters conducted shortly after that debate, decriminalizing the border enjoyed a paltry 27% of support.

But this was a Democratic primary -- the candidates were at least speaking to their base, right?

No. Only 45% of Democrats thought decriminalizing the border a good idea, versus 47% who didn't. When broken down even further, only 34% of moderate Democrats supported it, while 58% did not. And those coveted independent voters? Only 24% of them were on board.

Here was a policy proposal supported wholly by at least 14 Democratic candidates for president, and in some part by others, that had been resoundingly rejected by the majority of America, and also the majority of their own voters.

What was going on here? What were Democrats thinking?

The politics of extremes

This is emblematic of our new politics of extremes. In recent years, ultra-progressive voices on the left and only the Trumpiest of positions on the right seem to be winning out, while more moderate voices in both parties are going extinct.

On the right, just look at the fates of Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican Senator forced into early retirement for his pushback against Trump, or Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican congressman whose centrist views within his party prompted him to resign before finishing his term, leaving his seat vacant. (Dent is now a CNN political commentator). And the pileup of Republican retirements grow almost by the day.

Over on the left, there is some unity in common cause against Trump, but Democrats are also eating their own. Ocasio-Cortez pushed her Queens predecessor, former Rep. Joe Crowley, out after 20 years in that seat. Voices like those in ""the Squad"" -- Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Ilhan Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Rep. Ayanna Pressley -- get far more attention than their moderate counterparts.

A so-called "" alterna-squad ,"" a group of moderate Democratic congresswomen including Rep. Abigail Spanberger, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, has far less recognizable names. Unlike Ocasio-Cortez, none, for example, has been on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!""

Meanwhile, as Democrats and Republicans swing for the extremes, millions and millions of Americans are left without real representation. The 2020 primary is elucidating that. A line I've heard over and over again from moderates and independents after a Democratic debate is something to the effect of, ""Well I can't vote for Trump, but I'm not with those guys, either.""

In preferring to quadruple down on their most ardent base supporters, the parties are missing a wide swath of voters in the middle who are turned off by both the style and the substance of their increasingly absolutist proposals and their insistence that ""finding common ground"" is for wimps and traitors. (Just ask Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden how well it went over when he called Vice President Mike Pence ""a decent guy."")

Despite the rancor and fire-breathing on both sides, most voters are somewhere in the middle on any host of issues, even the most ""divisive.""

The silent middle majority

Take abortion. ""[M]ore than half of US adults take a non-absolutist position,"" according to Pew . Only 12% of voters say abortion should be illegal in all cases, and 27% say it should be legal in all cases. The rest of us -- the majority -- agree it should be legal but with restrictions.

Gun control is another issue in which the majority often goes unrepresented.

A number of gun control proposals enjoy wide bipartisan support, even among Republican voters. Polls show 72% support requiring background checks for private gun sales. And yet, the majority of Republican lawmakers refuse to even consider that widely popular measure. Shouldn't those voters feel betrayed by that?

Immigration, though, perhaps best encapsulates the political parties' willingness to ignore majority opinions, even inside their own parties.

While Democrats are clear on wanting a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and other undocumented immigrants, and Republicans frequently say that they don't , what neither seem to get is where they share common ground.

Believe it or not, a majority of Republicans (54%) believe there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in this country legally -- a path to legal status -- if they meet some requirements over time.

And as it turns out, that's what undocumented immigrants seem to prioritize as well. If we're to believe the naturalization rates following former President Ronald Reagan's 1986 amnesty bill, by 2009 only about 41% of those legalized had become American citizens. More than citizenship, many immigrants want to be able to come out of the shadows and work here legally.

So why are we arguing over citizenship instead of passing legal-status legislation, which enjoys majority support and even Republican support?

Legislative solutions aren't profitable

Here's the easy answer to that and other head-scratching questions about who is actually representing us: Solving problems isn't as politically profitable as keeping them broken.

Whether on immigration or gun crime, health care or climate, the two parties thrive when these issues remain broken. Democrats can fundraise off and run against xenophobic, gun-crazy, poor-hating, gas-guzzling Republicans, and Republicans do the same against open-border, gun-banning, wealth-redistributing, coal-killing Democrats.

Meanwhile, a majority of voters are left hanging with unsolved problems, somewhere in the middle of this never-ending scrum.

As much as it seems like Republican voters just want to ""own the Libs,"" and Democratic voters are happy being ""the resistance,"" it might surprise you to know that there are plenty who actually want cooperation between the parties.

Just after the 2018 midterm elections, in which Democrats took back the House, a full 46% of Democratic voters said they thought Democratic leaders in Congress should cooperate a great deal or a fair amount with Trump over the next two years.

Even more astonishingly, 77% of Republicans said Trump should cooperate with Democratic leaders in Congress.

All of which is to say that neither party seems all that concerned with where voters in the middle are on policy or tone. That's likely only going to get worse.

A party by the middle and for the middle

A third party could fill this void. This party wouldn't be ideological in nature, as those already exist. It wouldn't take this position or that one, and it wouldn't have a charter or a platform committing to a fixed value set. Its only commitment would be to represent and support the majority of moderates and independents on every issue, wherever they are.

For example, right now independents represent 38% of the electorate, including those who say they lean Democrat or lean Republican -- a.k.a. moderates. According to Pew , a third party representing these voters right now would support gay marriage and legalizing marijuana, it would oppose building a wall along the US-Mexico border and oppose increasing tariffs between the US and trading partners, and it believes that some government regulation is necessary to protect public interest and that a smaller government providing fewer services is best.

That third party would also lean pro-abortion -- keeping Roe v. Wade in place -- but would add some restrictions as to when and under what circumstances abortions should be given.

It supports stricter gun laws, background checks on all gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons. It doesn't, however, support a mandatory assault weapon buy back, and it believes mental illness is a bigger cause of mass shootings than the availability of guns.

It would support raising taxes on companies that burn fossil fuels and believes human activity is causing the climate to change.

In other words, it would represent the unaffiliated middle that isn't on either extreme. There wouldn't be any litmus or purity tests. It would support and run candidates who pledge to represent the middle, and not chase either party as they move further and further to the fringes. The party wouldn't have to contort itself to defend its leadership, because it would be driven by voters themselves.

One of the benefits of this sort of party is that it can't, by definition, attract demagogues, cult figures or egomaniacs. Campaigns are framed around voter polling, not personality or promises of pie-in-the-sky change that only a few are demanding. The only promise is to listen to you and legislate accordingly.

Naturally, the biggest hurdle to a viable third party is the parties themselves. Both hold enormous influence over the presidential elections, from managing donor lists to unleashing get-out-the-vote apparatus.

There's also the debates. Since the 1987 Commission on Presidential Debates was formed, both parties have fought to keep third-party interlopers out of the televised events. Ross Perot only won his place on the 1992 debate stage because both George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton demanded he be allowed to participate, both thinking they would benefit.

So long as the parties control the means of production, so to speak, third-party candidates will be seriously disadvantaged.

Finally, whether an alternative party in today's age of personality politics is realistic is a question for another essay. But just imagining a third party that isn't swayed by cable news hosts, preening politicians, special interests, that isn't designed solely to enrich coffers and play to an ever-shrinking base, but exists simply to reflect the moderate majority lowers one's blood pressure almost instantly.

Because let's face it: the two-party system, in all its absolutisms, is leaving many of us without representation. And if America's future is in the hands of these two parties alone for much longer, we'll all be politically homeless eventually."

(CNN) America is self-segregating into separate political realities. And partisan media is driving much of this division across new platforms, polarizing for profit while amplifying extreme voices and achieving unprecedented reach -- including the Oval Office.

President Donald Trump is a creature of partisan media, having kicked off his political career with regular appearances on Fox News. His obsessive consumption causes him to echo its talking points , often overriding information from US intelligence agencies. This leaves him susceptible to conspiracy theories that have now led to the fourth impeachment inquiry in our history.

We've always had partisan media in America, with Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson slashing each other in the pages of competing broadsheets on the same street in Philadelphia.

What we're dealing with today is different because of the pervasive scale of partisan media and its dissemination alongside disinformation. Its proliferation has been hastened by the rise of a partisan economy amid a fragmented media market, aiming to keep a narrow but intense niche audience addicted to anger, anxiety and resentment. But this is a Faustian bargain, because it requires going to ever-increasing extremes to keep the audience engaged while constantly attacking the credibility of nonpartisan news organizations.

The rise of social media has balkanized us further , amplifying the loudest voices, often manipulating perceptions of public opinion via anonymous bots and trolls, while driving many reasonable people from the public square of civic debate. These disinformation deployments often shape the tone of partisan media while exploiting the lack of trust it has helped create.

JUST WATCHED Avlon: Our enemies know America is polarized Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Avlon: Our enemies know America is polarized 03:34

The result is real: A new Pew Survey shows that 73% of Americans now believe that Republicans and Democrats cannot agree on basic facts. That's a potential death sentence for a democracy that depends on reasoning together to solve common problems.

This is also an unhealthy departure from our best traditions. We had partisan newspapers in the past that, for example, excoriated and defended the New Deal, but there was still a general baseline commitment to facts and a clear delineation between news and editorial opinion. On the broadcast side, the fairness doctrine, introduced in 1949, was a condition of leasing federal airwaves that aimed to ensure balance by requiring time for opposing political views.

That doesn't mean there were not deep disagreements and bitter debate.

The Joe McCarthy test

America was tested by the rise of Sen. Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin, a conservative, populist anti-communist with a demagogue's disregard for facts. While accusing Democrats of treason, McCarthy often tried to play the victim of the liberal elite media , equating The Washington Post with the communist Daily Worker -- while in fact old-line Republican papers like the Chicago Tribune and New York Herald Tribune were also warning about McCarthy's tactics.

McCarthy's rise on the back of wild accusations caused some editors to question whether the traditional approach of simply reporting what a public official said was consistent with the larger responsibility of telling the truth. But McCarthy met his match in Edward R. Murrow, the legendary CBS broadcast news pioneer, who took on McCarthy by fact-checking his public statements, closing his show in March 1954 by saying , ""We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. ... We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason.""

But Murrow vs. McCarthy was a notable exception in a post-war period. Despite the stickiness of who was determining what was fair and balanced, the fairness doctrine proved surprisingly popular among conservatives and liberals who believed it ensured a degree of ""public interest"" programming. When it was overturned by the Federal Communications Commission in 1987, the Senate voted 59-31 to reinstate it on bipartisan lines -- but it was vetoed by former President Ronald Reagan.

This is when partisan media as we know it began to proliferate.

From the fairness doctrine to Fox News

One study by former chief economist at the FCC Thomas Winslow Hazlett, recounted in his book "" The Political Spectrum ,"" found that talk radio took off after the fairness doctrine was dismantled, displacing what had been the most popular radio format: music. Our country got more polarized as partisan opinion became big business, untethered from any obligation to be fair and balanced.

This was the moment Roger Ailes had been waiting for. A one-time talk show producer-turned-political consultant, Ailes pushed a political strategy called ""positive polarization"" in Richard Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign. While Nixon repeated ""the press is the enemy"" like a mantra, Ailes envisioned the creation of a conservative news network that could counteract major newspapers and the big three networks.

Ailes had the opportunity to operationalize his partisan dream with the launch of Fox News in 1996. Extending the popularity of right-wing talk radio into cable news, the idea was simple and sinister: Only explicit bias could balance the implicit bias of the mainstream media. But in a breathtaking bit of cynicism, this partisan project would be sold as "" fair and balanced .""

Later that same year, MSNBC launched and evolved into a liberal counterweight. The partisan media arms race was on. But what is good for ratings can be bad for the country.

Partisan media and the decline of trust

The impact was clear: Just over a decade later, a Pew Survey on media credibility found that ""virtually every news organization or program has seen its credibility marks decline."" Even C-SPAN, which offers unedited coverage of public events, experienced a steep decline in believability. In this hyper-partisan environment, people literally weren't trusting what they see with their own eyes.

Instead of creating more informed citizens, partisan media compounded tribalism through an echo chamber -- a loose network of blogs, talk radio and partisan cable news that mainstreamed conspiracy theories and increasingly gave talking points to party leaders rather than vice versa.

Then came social media. It promised to break down barriers, but instead of simply being a great leveler, it was quickly hijacked by operatives who realized that it was also the greatest vehicle for disinformation ever devised.

The Trump effect

All these dynamics contributed to the rise of Donald Trump to the presidency. He took his reality television celebrity and morphed it into political influence with weekly segments on ""Fox and Friends,"" where he started peddling the birther conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama was ineligible to be president.

But it was his use of Twitter to hijack news cycles with outrageous statements that really boosted his presidential campaign. What Trump understood better than most is that news doesn't have a liberal or a conservative bias as much as a conflict bias -- and he supplied constant conflict in ways that fired up his base while dominating news cycles on stations and sites across the political spectrum.

JUST WATCHED Stephen Miller: From white supremacist sites to the White House Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Stephen Miller: From white supremacist sites to the White House 03:05

The Republican establishment couldn't stop his rise, because the conservative base had become radicalized by hyper-partisan media while many on the center-right had opted out of the party.

It was a joint effort. During the 2016 campaign, Trump relied on regular strategic conversations with Ailes and Sean Hannity, while bringing on the former head of Breitbart News, Steve Bannon, to run his campaign. Put simply, Trump promoted hyper-partisan media, and they promoted him in return.

On the most extreme edge, we even learned that the campaign's senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, was back-channeling with Breitbart to influence their immigration coverage with white nationalist sites. On a far more prominent and less fringe scale, The Washington Post's Erik Wemple chronicled Hannity's many mentions in campaign emails and called him their ""chief propagandist ... looped in on all their talking points, their deflections and their innumerable attacks.""

During the final weeks of the campaign, when few even inside Trump's orbit believed he could win, Trump was musing about starting his own right-wing television station -- Trump TV -- to be led by none other than Ailes. It would allow him to monetize the movement he'd begun while continuing its momentum based on the idea that the election had been stolen.

But trolls and bots on social media -- many of them connected to Russia -- were engaging in an all-out final push to try to elect Trump, exploiting the environment of extremism and distrust that partisan media created, posting intentionally fake stories at an accelerated rate. In the final three months of the campaign, the top performing intentionally false stories on Facebook -- designed to benefit Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton -- out-performed the top news stories from actual publications, according to the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report.

The top two fake news stories were Pope Francis' (non-existent) endorsement of Trump and Wikileaks' ""confirmation"" of Hillary Clinton's weapons sales to ISIS -- which reached more than 1.7 million people. One analyst explained that ""it seems pretty clear that false information outperforms true information.""

President-elect Trump quickly tried to twist the term ""fake news"" -- which helped him win the election -- to refer to any independent journalism that displeased him in any way. He has used the term more than 1,100 times since inauguration, according to Factba.se, while autocrats around the world approvingly picked up the term.

Partisan media was in the White House, and Trump's relationship with Fox News became something unseen in American history -- with the President constantly watching and tweeting out promos to friendly shows while hiring more than 20 administration aides from the extended Fox talent pool.

When his staffers burnt out or were forced out, they often found jobs at Fox -- while a few lonely correspondents and anchors such as Shepard Smith committed to facts found themselves under fire from viewers as well as the President.

""I've never seen anything like it before,"" Fox News president-turned-NYU journalism professor Joe Peyronnin told The New Yorker's Jane Mayer . ""It's as if the President had his own press organization. It's not healthy.""

Partisan media takes over the White House

We see that partisan media has completed its takeover of the White House -- electing and bolstering an unpopular President while perpetuating a separate political reality for his supporters. But there is a cost to living in that closed environment.

The fourth impeachment inquiry in American history was launched because Trump bought into discredited conspiracy theories that Ukraine -- not Russia -- had hacked the Democratic National Committee while pushing that country's new President to investigate the family of his chief political rival. These ideas were allegedly spread from interested parties and fringe sites to being investigated by Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani -- who fed information to The Hill's John Solomon -- whose articles created ""evidence"" used to justify the investigation. Solomon would in turn promote his stories on Hannity's show on Fox News -- creating a confirmation bias feedback loop built on falsehoods, or what the President's supporters might call ""alternative facts.""

The media coverage of the subsequent impeachment inquiry hearings was also polarized, with one side focused on testimony and facts, while the other side attacked the State Department and White House witnesses as ""Never Trumpers,"" "" nerdy guys ,"" ""radicals,"" ""partisan bureaucrats"" and even a "" self-important, very narcissistic diplomatic snowflake ."" There's an inability to agree on basic facts, and instead the politics of personal attacks seem to have aligned with the President's talking points.

Confronting an age of unreason

There's no question that partisan media has driven the polarization that's afflicting our nation. It is driving the agenda in the White House. And proximity to power creates a gravitational pull toward normalization.

But the partisan echo chamber is a route to radicalization. As Cass Sunstein explains in his book ""Going to Extremes,"" ""A good way to create an extremist group, or a cult of any kind, is to separate members from the rest of society. The separation can occur physically or psychologically, by creating a sense of suspicion about non-members.

26 voices on why the free press matters,['Richard Galant'],"(CNN) 2017 was a year when discussions of press freedom and the media's choices reached a new level of intensity.

White House briefings, presidential tweets and rallies critiqued the media.

Journalists pushed back, while engaging in lively debate about the ways they approach their work.

And, perhaps fittingly, the year is about to end with the release of ""The Post,"" a Steven Spielberg film, starring Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, that retells the story of how an administration tried, and ultimately failed, to stop newspapers from printing a damning government report about the Vietnam War.

Despite the news coverage, the Hollywood treatment and the millions of words of commentary about these issues, just how much do most of us truly understand about why journalists do what they do and why the Constitution affords protection for free expression?"
Democracy's immune system is in trouble. Here's what we can do,['Craig Newmark'],"Craig Newmark is the founder of Craigslist and the Craig Newmark Philanthropies, which supports and connects nonprofit communities and drives civic engagement. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. This is the next installment in CNN Opinion's series on the challenges facing the media as it is under attack from critics, governments and changing technology.

(CNN) Throughout history, the media has been used to manipulate and influence political outcomes. Julius Caesar used war journaling, or a written firsthand account of war and its rationale, to justify the invasion and destruction of the Gallic tribes two millennia ago. His heir, Octavian, used a disinformation campaign to convince the Senate to declare war against Mark Antony.

In later years, new communications tools, such as the printing press and moveable type, made it easier for philosophers including John Locke and Thomas Paine to influence new forms of democracy, which, while imperfect, have been more successful than other forms of government.

What these historic figures didn't have access to is digital technology, which democratizes media but also eases the spread of disinformation. The internet allows all who have access to participate, but it also amplifies the effectiveness of media manipulation via automation. Botnets (which are made up of networks of individual, social media and bot accounts that appear to be owned by real people) act as a force multiplier, distributing disinformation in the form of ""fake news"" on a massive scale. We saw this in the 2016 US presidential election, as Russian propaganda flooded social media platforms to divide the nation.

However, a broad community of good actors, including foundations and nonprofits committed to journalistic integrity, are emerging to promote media literacy and good-faith reporting. As a news consumer and a philanthropist (not an expert), I'm invested in supporting these knowledgeable institutions and initiatives to ensure that we have access to fair and accurate reporting. I care about this issue because I believe a strong, vigorous and trustworthy press is the immune system of democracy.

Last year that immune system failed, which is why we need to focus on rebuilding and sustaining a trustworthy press now more than ever. While a complex task, given the evolving uses of technology in spreading disinformation, in order to remedy this issue we must create a more formalized journalistic code of ethics for the digital age.

O'Keefe has spent years attempting to expose alleged liberal bias in mainstream media organizations, which, in and of itself, is a worthy goal. Every member of a quality news organization -- editors, reporters, producers and executives -- should be prepared to explain and defend their work and methods: what stories we cover, how we do it and what assumptions or hidden biases might lie behind our choices.

But serious media critics have a responsibility, too, one that is equal to, if not greater than, the organizations they wish to expose. That means operating with honesty, fairness and good faith, taking care to back up accusations with concrete evidence.

But O'Keefe, whose website describes him as ""an award-winning journalist,"" is more partisan prankster than honest critic. Despite naming his organization Project Veritas (Latin for ""truth""), O'Keefe has frequently resorted to deceptive and occasionally illegal tactics, including the use of false identities , trespassing and selectively edited videos that have frequently been debunked"

(CNN) For years, newsrooms across America have had a problem with a lack of diversity and inclusion. People of color are underrepresented among news organizations, which do not reflect the makeup of the general population and have made little progress in the past decade.

Although non-whites make up about 40% of the US population, journalists of color comprise only 16.55% of newsrooms' staff in 2017, according to the American Society of Newspaper Editors (ASNE) Newsroom Employment Diversity Survey.

Larger newsrooms and digital news organizations are a little better — 23.4% and 24.3%, respectively — but not much. People of color are only 13.4% of newsroom leaders.

This comes at a time when society needs and demands more inclusive news . It's been 190 years since the creation of the black press, and it's as relevant as ever.

In the absence of an inclusive environment, the quality of journalism suffers. Certain stories are simply not reported, or are told without the nuance or perspective the circumstances require. The black press has filled that void for generations. And with the advent of digital platforms, a baton has been passed to black millennial writers to continue presenting narratives, with underrepresented points of views, that would otherwise go missing -- and do not necessarily reflect the white men who dominate the industry.

Far beyond using social media for entertainment, shopping or communication, African-American millennials have elevated Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and other platforms to raise public consciousness about the issues impacting black people. The hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #OscarsSoWhite are prime examples of this phenomenon.

According to Nielsen, 55% of black consumers between 18 and 34 spend at least an hour on social media each day, 6% higher than all millennials. In addition, 29% of black millennials spend three or more hours daily on social media sites, 9% higher than that of all millennials.

While black millennials fall below their counterparts in the percentage of leisure time spent on social media, they exceed the general millennial population in their overall presence on Twitter, Tumblr, Google+ and Whatsapp. That online presence has translated into the creation of a network of black news outlets specifically creating content that will meet readers and viewers where they are.

Additionally, when the mainstream media covers a particular issue, the black press may cover it with a completely different angle -- if not a different issue altogether. For example, the black press rejected the mainstream media narrative that white ""working class"" support for Trump was primarily economic in nature, reporting instead on the presidential candidate's appeal to white solidarity, raw racism and the scapegoating of minority groups.

After all, white economic angst by itself does not reconcile the fact that whites always have fared better than their African- and Latino-Americans. And while the mainstream news organizations have framed the NFL protests through the prism of patriotism and support for the military, the black press has focused on the crisis of police brutality and racial violence that underlie the athletes' decision to take a knee during the national anthem.

Fifty years ago, when unrest rocked cities across the nation as a result of police brutality and systemic racism, the Kerner Commission -- an 11-member commission appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson that highlighted racism for its role in a surge in urban riots -- took the news media to task.

""We have found a significant imbalance between what actually happened in our cities and what the newspaper, radio and television coverage of the riots told us happened,"" the Kerner report said

""Our second and fundamental criticism is that the news media have failed to analyze and report adequately on racial problems in the United States and, as a related matter, to meet the Negro's legitimate expectations in journalism. By and large, news organizations have failed to communicate to both their black and white audiences a sense of the problems America faces and the sources of potential solutions.""

The Commission made a number of recommendations, including that news organizations employ black people beyond mere tokenism and in positions of real responsibility, and that they publish newspapers and produce programs that acknowledge black people, who they are and what they do.

Although newsrooms have made some progress, it's not where it should or needs to be. But by empowering themselves and their followers — without gatekeepers and intermediaries in the traditional media sense — young, black journalists have reached a broad audience. They can educate and mobilize others to act on a given issue, and connect with local, national and global social justice movements.

A videographer or documentarian can broadcast a crime in progress — such as a police beating of an unarmed motorist -- live and in real time, before an audience of thousands if not millions. In that regard, technology is the great equalizer, a check on the abuse of official power and a call to reform harmful patterns and discriminatory practices.

From its inception, the black press has been a change agent by shining a light on the plight of blacks and giving them the power to write and report on their own narratives. In New York in 1827, Rev. Samuel Cornish and John B. Russwurm began publication of Freedom's Journal, the first black-owned newspaper in America. Excluded from white venues and often insulted in their absence, black voices found the need to tell their own stories.

""We wish to plead our own cause. Too long have others spoken for us. Too long has the public been deceived by representations, in things which concern us dearly,"" wrote the editors in their first edition

Throughout the Civil War , black newspapers were centers for political debate on the war and emancipation, and advocacy for black soldiers. During Jim Crow and the reign of Klan terror, the black press fought against segregation, demanded equal rights for African Americans and helped elect politicians to office.

The Chicago Defender , which had demanded federal intervention from President Woodrow Wilson to stop lynchings, played a role in the Great Migration by urging a mass exodus of black people from the South.

In the 1890s, journalist Ida B. Wells led a campaign against lynching at considerable personal risk. Born a slave, she wrote about the injustices of racial segregation in the South. A mob descended upon her Memphis news office, destroyed her equipment and threatened her with death.

Over the years, many black publications disappeared. Others learned to navigate the new landscape, and a plethora of new black media emerged with a strictly online presence, impacting the manner that black people digest and make sense of the news.

The days of ""reading the paper"" are long gone for many, but what remains the same is that the black press doesn't look like the theoretical textbook case of objective journalism -- and it was never meant to be -- whatever that means to you.

When narratives are told from the perspective of a black lens, perhaps there are no two sides to a story. Perhaps there is only one side, or numerous sides with various textures and shades. What is certain is there is a sense of responsibility to the community, advocating for that community and telling their stories from their perspective.

A digital environment arms African-American millennial writers with tools that enable them to carve out their own territory in their unique and innovative way -- exercising free speech and contributing to a healthy democracy, and staying true to the proud history of the black press."
Branding news outlets as foreign agents won't make them any more transparent,['Suzanne Nossel'],"Suzanne Nossel is executive director of PEN America. She was formerly executive director of Amnesty International USA and deputy assistant secretary of state for international organizations at the State Department. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) RT -- the Kremlin-funded news channel formerly known as ""Russia Today,"" frequently cited as a central gear in Russia's propaganda machine -- is nothing if not colorful. The network is known for declaring the Boston Marathon bombings a government plot , publicly shaming its own journalists if they dare defy the Kremlin line and for featuring American commentators known for conspiracy-mongering.

Following years of hue and cry over the network's overt pro-Kremlin bias, earlier this month the Department of Justice forced the channel to file under the ""Foreign Agents Registration Act,"" or FARA , a 1938 law that was initially passed to counter pro-Nazi propaganda and subsequently retooled in the 1960s to publicly pinpoint those lobbying on behalf of foreign interests.

Forcing RT to register as a foreign agent is justified, but isn't the best way to counter the propaganda the channel -- or any other source of disinformation for that matter -- puts out. While RT has howled its objections, the network may protest too much. Absent a far wider effort to incentivize and enable news consumers to distinguish serious news and analysis from agitprop, FARA registration or not, the influence of RT and other shady news sources may survive intact.

The problem is that while RT's FARA registration may make members of Congress and administration officials feel as though they've landed a blow in the fight against Russian propaganda, RT's filing with the Justice Department may well never register with most news consumers. From the looks of things there is no easy way for a consumer of RT to learn that it has filed as a foreign agent. It is not mentioned in the ""About Us"" section of RT nor flagged on RT stories that appear in Google searches. The same is true of the China Daily News, a media outlet long registered under FARA as an agent of the Chinese government.

News cognoscenti are already well aware of RT's lineage, but to get through to those who read and believe the network will require more than the fine print in a government filing.

Former FBI Director James Comey put it bluntly in testimony last March before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, saying, ""The Kremlin is waging an international disinformation campaign through the RT propaganda network which traffics in anti-American conspiracy theories that rivaled the extravagant untruths of Soviet era Pravda.""

In late October Twitter announced that it would ""off-board"" all advertising from RT and Sputnik, another Russian-controlled platform, based on its own investigation and on US intelligence agencies' conclusion that the networks had sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 election at Putin's behest.

Whereas FARA contains an exception for bona fide media organizations, those state-owned entities that have qualified for it -- including the BBC and Germany's Deutsche Welle -- have strong layers of publicly visible and reputable independent governance that shield editorial decision-making from government interference.

While critics have been hard-pressed to argue that RT does not meet the criteria for registration under the act, they have rightly pointed out that by enforcing its provisions against the network, the US will likely trigger a wave of retaliatory and copycat measures designed by governments to clamp down on media outlets considered unfriendly. Indeed, the Russian Duma, acting at Putin's behest, moved swiftly to pass its own version of foreign media registration requirements last week. Russia's Ministry of Justice has let US government-backed networks, including Voice of American and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) know that they may be required to register under the new act. Russia is also reportedly considering more sweeping bans on the availability of foreign print media.

In some ways, these new measures are old news: US government-backed VOA and RFE/RL have been blocked from broadcasting in Russia for years. The more worrying prospect is that repressive regimes elsewhere in the world -- think the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte or Uzbekistan's Islam Karimov -- are emboldened in acting to foster local distrust of credible international media outlets.

With consumers accessing the vast majority of their news via Facebook and other social media feeds, the likelihood that news of RT's filing will color the reception of its stories among those who currently tune in seems dim. Tangible indicators of likely veracity -- including information about the news source, its track record, ethical guidelines and reporting methods -- can be ferreted out only through time-consuming research, if at all. A study earlier this year by the Media Insight Project revealed that consumers are far more likely to evaluate the veracity of a news article based on who shared it than what the source is.

If anything, worries about RT's influence point to the fact that transparency in American news media consumption cannot come solely, or even primarily, through force of law. Rather, we need Americans to be trained and educated to expect and demand transparency about ownership, editorial control, potential conflicts of interest and internal checks and processes to preserve objectivity and accuracy from the news that we consume. And, if outlets insist on remaining opaque on these fronts, as has RT, we should know to reject those outlets as unreliable.

We should prize voluntary transparency by news outlets, and should refuse to pay for, devote our attention to, do business with and share information from outlets unwilling to be transparent. As primary conduits for news, social media platforms have an essential role to play in equipping and empowering users to get the information they need to make sound judgments about what they're reading and sharing.

In an open media ecosystem, especially as one as large and freewheeling as the internet, government regulation is never going to be a satisfactory answer for the scourge of fraudulent news or propaganda.

Ultimately, the best defense against fake news and foreign propaganda lies in comprehensive public education on the uses and misuses of media. News literacy curricula in schools and workplaces, easier-to-use reference material tied to news shared online, transparent newsroom policies on subjects like conflicts of interest and corrections and rigorous methods of sourcing and crediting are all essential to enabling news consumers to navigate the information ocean in which many now drown.

It is true that Americans are fiercely independent in choosing what media to consume and credit. But no one wants to be fooled. Rather than consoling ourselves that RT's motives and loyalties will now be laid bare, the network's belated registration under FARA is just one more reminder that absent more far-reaching action, purveyors of propaganda and fraudulent news will likely continue to work their will on a populace that is ill-equipped to defend itself."
Student journalists deserve a free press too,['Frank Lomonte'],"Attorney Frank D. LoMonte is a professor of media law at the University of Florida, where he runs the Brechner Center for Freedom of Information . As the executive director of the Student Press Law Center from 2008 until August 2017, he launched the ""New Voices"" initiative to enact laws protecting student journalism. The views expressed in this commentary are solely his. This is the latest installment in CNN Opinion's series on the challenges facing the media as it is under attack from critics, governments and changing technology.

(CNN) When a California judge entered an unlawful order sealing an entire lawsuit file -- including, bizarrely, even the court order imposing the seal -- outraged journalists took action to defend the public's right to know.

With the help of volunteer legal counsel, reporters Anumita Jain and Armaan Rashid filed a petition in a Contra Costa County court to unseal the case file, which involves a school district's decision to discipline a Danville student over a homemade social-media video said to depict Arabs as terrorists. The school district's decision to remove the student as president of the student government association as punishment for the video -- and then restore him to the position after a public outcry -- dominated two local school board meetings, but without access to the court file, the details of the case (including the contents of the video) remain a puzzle to the community.

There's nothing especially novel about the case -- except that the journalists are themselves in high school , staff members of the Wildcat Tribune newspaper that has provided the community's most thorough and reliable coverage of the lawsuit and the controversy behind it.

""As journalists, Rashid and Jani are attempting to discharge their duties in the highest and best ethical tradition by obtaining direct access to first-hand documentation about a news event,"" says their motion to unseal the file, which is awaiting a ruling in Contra Costa County Superior Court.

That high school journalists are capable of work rivaling that of professionals, and that they have taken the lead in battling a lack of government transparency, should come as no surprise to anyone. Some of the best journalism in America today is coming out of student-run outlets, as demonstrated by the acclaimed investigative reporting of a team at Kansas' Pittsburg High School, who so painstakingly discredited their newly hired principal's inflated resumé that she was forced to resign.

It may come as more of a surprise to learn that in many ways, this dedication is more the rule than the exception. Student journalists are, increasingly, the information lifeline for their communities. With employment in traditional newsrooms hitting historic lows , down 42% since 1990, the public is more reliant than ever on students to sound the alarm if schools are unsafe or ineffective -- or if there's any story unfolding on their campus that could affect their community. Education news now accounts for just 1.4% of the time and space in mainstream media outlets, according to a 2009 study by the Brookings Institution. It's up to students to fill that information void -- if their schools will let them.

High schools often nurture the mentality that students have a ""civic duty"" to say only favorable things about the education they're receiving. ""Be true to your school"" is a nice enough idea -- but you won't find it in the Constitution. ""Citizens will be punished if they question or criticize the government"" isn't a sentiment that belongs in any American educational institution. As a lawyer assisting students in censorship cases, I once had a school superintendent in Tennessee tell me that a student's political column was rejected because it ""might cause passionate conversations"" -- as if passionate conversations about politics were a distraction from learning and not central to it.

Regrettably, for every student in a well-supported journalism program at a secondary school empowered to use media to right wrongs, there is another student who's been bullied and silenced by image-obsessed school authorities whose highest priority is avoiding controversy, not providing a quality education.

In Flushing, New York, for example , a principal refused to print an entire edition of the Advocate newspaper in spring 2017 because of a column that captured students' honest assessment of the shortcomings of Flushing High School (in particular, one student's comment that ""out of my 8 classes, only 3 of my teachers really care."")

In Omaha, Nebraska, school authorities retaliated against the Pawprint student news outlet at Millard West High School for a factually accurate article questioning the propriety of some (unnamed) teachers' classroom criticisms of President Trump. First, they pulled the article offline. Then, after relenting in the face of a potential First Amendment lawsuit, they removed a well-credentialed faculty adviser from her job -- just weeks after her students won the best-in-state award for the newspaper she advised.

In the Chicago suburb of Steinmetz in 2016, a high school principal ordered the student newspaper shuttered and the journalism program canceled in mid-semester after a student reporter defied his orders not to write on her personal off-campus blog about a controversy over changing the starting time of the school day. (The school district ultimately overruled the decision after private benefactors stepped forward to volunteer to pay for printing the newspaper.)

While it seems outrageous for schools to use their power over students for purposes of public relations or image maintenance, it's not clear that it's illegal.

In a 1988 ruling, Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier , the US Supreme Court stripped students of all meaningful constitutional protection when they use a school-provided publication or platform to convey their speech. The Hazelwood decision was widely denounced by First Amendment scholars at the time, and it hasn't aged well -- imagine, in 2017, trying to prevent high school students from learning about teen pregnancy by yanking pages out of newspapers, as the principal of Hazelwood East High School did -- but it endures as a stain on the lawbooks. In the 30 years since, there is only one documented case of a high school journalist successfully challenging school censorship in court, a 2004 case in which a Michigan student was prevented from publishing a truthful article about a lawsuit against her school because the school didn't want to call public attention to the case.

Fortunately, help is on the way. Increasingly, state legislators are recognizing the unique educational value of student journalism and stepping up to protect the journalists that Hazelwood left vulnerable.

California and Kansas were among the first states to embrace press freedom in schools, and it's no coincidence that the courageous public-service journalism being done in Danville and Pittsburg isn't being seen in Flushing or in Omaha.

Thirteen states from coast-to-coast now protect student journalism against image-motivated censorship, and bills are anticipated in at least a half-dozen other states in 2018.

The case for protecting press freedom in schools isn't just about training future journalists. It's about developing inquisitive, participatory citizens willing to ask the hard questions of government authorities that involved citizenship demands.

It's also about rooting out systemic inequality. Research by University of Kansas scholars documents that censorship is a pervasive problem in high school newsrooms -- and that it disproportionately affects young women.

More than half of all female students surveyed during the 2015 school year reported that they'd ""self-censored"" from pursuing a story, anticipating an adverse reaction from school authorities -- a rate twice that of male students. And more than one-third of all students said they'd been categorically banned from talking about certain topics in student media. (The most frequently forbidden subject? Unthinkably, in the midst of an epidemic of opioid fatalities, it's substance abuse.)

Kansas journalism professor Peter Bobkowski, co-leader of the survey, has documented the civic-education benefits of working in a student newsroom where First Amendment principles are honored. After separately surveying 900 high school journalists across a variety of schools in Kansas and Missouri, Bobkowski found that students whose journalistic work is respected and valued develop greater confidence (what he calls ""civic efficacy"") in their ability to use their voices to make social and political change.

It's fashionable to point fingers at social-justice-drunk ""snowflakes"" for devaluing the First Amendment in higher education, but that misses the point. Students arriving on America's college campuses have largely spent the formative years of their educational lives watching fundamental constitutional principles devalued and their rights and voices routinely disregarded without consequence by respected authority figures.

It's no mystery why students believe it's the government's job to protect them from offensive speech: the Supreme Court told them in Hazelwood that the government's interest in avoiding political controversy is more important than freedom of the press, and they've lived that reality every day of their K-12 lives. The erosion of First Amendment values will be reversed only when schools reopen their doors to the ""passionate conversations"" that effective civic learning requires."

The Associated Press is still not calling the presidential race because neither Joe Biden nor President Trump has secured the 270 electoral votes — a majority of the 538 that are up for grabs — needed to claim victory. Millions of ballots are being counted in key states that remain too close to call, including Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Trump and his campaign continue to make unsubstantiated and unspecified claims of voter fraud as Biden inches ever closer to the 270-vote threshold.

""We don't have a final declaration,"" Biden said in a speech from Wilmington, Del., Friday night. ""But the numbers tell us a clear and convincing story. We are going to win this race.""

Here's where the race to 270 currently stands:

• Biden: 264

• Trump: 214

The latest on key races:

• Arizona: Biden leads Trump by about 30,000 votes as of Friday evening. The AP called Arizona for Biden around 2:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday. Fox News had also called the state for Biden, angering the president's campaign, which expressed confidence it can still win.

• Nevada: Biden had been leading in the Silver State by a comfortable margin on election night, but the race tightened considerably. Biden's lead over Trump is now just north of 22,000 votes.

• Georgia: Biden took the lead in the Peach State early Friday and leads Trump by about 7,000 votes. The secretary of state announced that there will be a recount in Georgia as the final margin is expected to be within half a percentage point.

• Pennsylvania: Biden took the lead in the Keystone State Friday morning. As of 8 a.m. ET Saturday, his edge over Trump was more than 28,000 votes.

COVID and the election:

While the votes continue to be counted, the number of U.S. coronavirus cases continues to climb. There were a record 122,000 cases reported Friday, adding to the total of more than 9.7 million who've been infected. More than 237,000 Americans have died so far this year.

Belarus opens nuclear plant opposed by neighboring Lithuania,[],"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on Saturday formally opened the country’s first nuclear power plant, a project sharply criticized by neighboring Lithuania.

Lukashenko said the launch of the Russian-built and -financed Astravyets plant “will serve as an impetus for attracting the most advanced technologies to the country, and innovative directions in science and education.”

Lithuania has long opposed the plant, located about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of its capital, Vilnius. Lithuanian authorities say the project has been plagued by accidents, stolen materials and the mistreatment of workers.

In line with a law banning electricity imports from Belarus once the nuclear plant started up, Lithuania’s Litgrid power operator cut the inflow of electricity from Belarus when the plant began producing electricity on Tuesday.

Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom, which built the plant, has rejected the Lithuanian complaints, saying the plant’s design conforms to the highest international standards as confirmed by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

Upon its planned completion in 2022, the plant is to have two reactor units, each generating 1200 megawatts. Currently, the one working reactor is generating 400 megawatts.

The power plant’s construction was delayed when a reactor vessel slipped to the ground in 2016 after workers failed to strap it properly during installation. Rosatom insisted at the time that the reactor wasn’t damaged, but it agreed to replace the unit at the demand of Belarusian authorities.

Belarus suffered severe damage from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, which spewed radioactive fallout from a plant in then-Soviet Ukraine across large areas of Europe. That painful legacy has fueled opposition to the nuclear plant project in Belarus.

Andrei Sannikov, a prominent opposition figure who was imprisoned for 16 months after running against Lukashenko in the 2010 presidential election, tweeted Saturday that the plant constitutes a “geopolitical weapon” against the European Union.

Lithuania closed its sole Soviet-built nuclear power plant in 2009. In recent weeks, Lithuanian authorities have handed out free iodine pills to residents living near the Belarus border. Iodine can help reduce radiation buildup in the thyroid in case of a leak at the nuclear plant."
Spanish-language misinformation dogged Democrats in U.S. election,"['Christopher Bing', 'Elizabeth Culliford', 'Paresh Dave']","By Christopher Bing, Elizabeth Culliford and Paresh Dave

(Reuters) - Spanish-language misinformation flourished online in the days surrounding the U.S. election, even as social media companies moved to stem falsehoods that could affect the vote or spark violence.

Spanish-language social media posts from online celebrities, radio commentators and others have repeatedly questioned the reliability of mail-in voting and falsely described presidential candidate Joe Biden as a socialist, according to Spanish-language disinformation experts and posts seen by Reuters.

Other postings have pushed QAnon in Spanish, a conspiracy theory that claims incumbent President Donald Trump is fighting a cabal of ""deep state"" sex-traffickers, and describe Biden as a ""superpredator"" or a ""pedophile,"" these people said.

Social media companies introduced new rules to crack down on election-related misinformation through labeling content, restricting its reach or removing it, but enforcement has been uneven.

While Alphabet Inc's YouTube, Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc have all taken action against some false or misleading Spanish-language posts, many more remain online and have continued to spread, Reuters found.

“On Facebook and the other platforms it takes them longer to flag and take action when the post is in Spanish than English,” said Daniel Acosta Ramos, an investigative researcher with First Draft, echoing a complaint voiced by four other experts who spoke with Reuters.

A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter but said the company had taken multiple steps to combat misinformation in Spanish, including adding two new Spanish-language fact-checking partners before the election. She did not address a list of posts and videos shared by Reuters that appear to violate the company's policies.

Social media researchers also expressed concern about the spread of misinformation on the WhatsApp messaging service.

Lisa Zayas, a progressive organizer in Florida, provided Reuters with examples of Spanish-language misinformation spread through multiple WhatsApp channels used in her local community. The memes and graphics paint a picture of a Democratic challenger bent on passing laws ""against"" the church.

Story continues

Misinformation on WhatsApp remains especially difficult to study or counter, since it involves private messages. Zayas said the examples she noticed typically originated on Facebook, Twitter or YouTube but were delivered within the chat app.

“There's been other countries who've had democratic elections where there has been much more disinformation that is peer-to-peer, specifically India and Brazil, because of the deep penetration of WhatsApp and so it is possible that it played a role [here],” said Alex Stamos, a former chief information security officer for Facebook.

A WhatsApp spokesman said a new policy limiting the forwarding of messages was an important tool in the misinformation fight.





'SLAVES OF THE MATRIX'

Spanish-speaking voters are a key constituency in multiple battleground states and Biden's support among those voters was lower than expected in some regions. In Florida, the Republican Trump won 45% of the Latino vote, an 11-point improvement from 2016.

It is unclear whether such misinformation had any impact on the Latino vote, which is made up of diverse nationalities and interests, this year.

Avaaz, a global civic organization, said on Thursday it found at least 43 Spanish-language posts across social media promoting false narratives about the election. The content has generated more than 1.4 million social media interactions so far, it added.

The group cited several examples, including two Facebook pages described as “news and media websites.” Each is respectively named “Slaves of the Matrix” and “Mr.capacho en vivo” and boast more than 250,000 followers combined. Their posts regularly attract tens of thousands of viewers and thousands of comments and shares.

The two pages claimed Trump had won re-election, before the ballots were all counted, that Democrats were trying to steal votes, and warned of an impending social media blackout. Posts making the false claims did not receive a fact-check but contained Facebook labels that directed users to ""See Election Updates.""

Media intelligence firm Zignal Labs also told Reuters it had noticed a flurry of Spanish-language social media and internet forum posts connecting Biden to pedophilia in the run-up to Nov. 3. They were spread across multiple internet platforms analyzed by Zignal, including Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, and amateur news blogs.

Zignal said it found more than 7,000 mentions containing a combination of the phrases ""Biden"" or ""Hunter"" and ""pedófilo"" on Election Day and more than 40,000 in the weeks preceding it. It captured another 12,596 mentions on Tuesday in Spanish referring to Biden stealing the election.

Many of the posts remain active and have not been removed.

YouTube removed two videos containing Spanish-langauge election misinformation that had racked up thousands of views after Reuters flagged them to a spokesperson, who said the company's policies applied ""consistently across all languages and regions.""

NYPD investigating anti-discrimination chief over alleged vulgar posts,['Victoria Albert'],"The commanding officer of the NYPD's workplace discrimination office has been relieved of his command and placed on modified duty as the department investigates allegations that he posted a slew of racist, sexist and homophobic comments on a message board for police officers, the department confirmed to CBS News. The investigation comes after the New York City Council's Oversight and Investigations Division released a report linking Deputy Inspector James Kobel to vulgar posts spanning more than a year.

The report alleges that Kobel is the person behind the screen name ""Clouseau,"" which posted more than 500 messages since July 2019 on the online message board ""Law Enforcement Rant.""

In the posts cited in the report, Clouseau repeatedly used vulgar and offensive language to describe public officials and members of the public, including Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark and Representative Ilhan Omar. In one post, he called former president Barack Obama a ""Muslim savage.""

He also targeted Eric Garner, a Black man who died in New York in 2014 after an officer put him in a chokehold, with multiple racist posts about him and his family.

Although the report did not conclusively prove that Kobel is Clouseau, it offered evidence showing similarities between Kobel and Clouseau. According to Clouseau's posts and Kobel's public records, both joined the force on the same day, held the rank of captain or higher in 2019, and worked in the NYPD Housing Bureau under former Chief Joanne Jaffe, the report said. They also proposed to their wives at the same time, live in the same county, and have fathers who died at the same age with similar NYPD service records.

Kobel, who the report said has worked at the NYPD for more than 28 years, has adamantly denied writing under the name Clouseau. He told The New York Times, which first reported the investigation, that, ""I am unfamiliar with any of these posts … I'm unfamiliar with 'Clouseau.' I don't post on the Rant.""

Story continues

The head of the Captains Endowment Association, the union that represents Kobel, told the Times that Kobel was likely framed by someone who was unhappy about the results of one of the many harassment investigations he's conducted.

""Clearly, he has angered some people along the way,"" said Captain Chris Monahan. ""In any event, he looks forward to being fully exonerated when all the facts come out.""

While the NYPD told CBS News that the evidence against Kobel was ""circumstantial,"" the department said it nevertheless ""merited immediate investigation by the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau."" The statement said Kobel has cooperated with the investigation.

Richard Esposito, the department's deputy commissioner of public information, told the Times that the investigation is not complete and that there was still substantial work to be done.

As the commanding officer of the NYPD's Office of Equal Employment Opportunity, Kobel was responsible for promoting ""a fair, safe, inclusive and accommodating work environment for all members of the [NYPD]"" and ""for ensuring [the NYPD's] employees are treated with dignity and respect in the workplace…and promoting a fair and inclusive workplace that is free from discrimination and harassment,"" according to the office's website. The report said Kobel worked as the office's second in command for at least four years before he was promoted in May.

Oversight and Investigations Committee Chair Ritchie Torres condemned the posted messages in a statement accompanying the report.

""The virulent bigotry of Deputy Inspector James Francis Kobel has no place in the NYPD, much less in the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity. The shocking nature of the misconduct revealed in this report would call for nothing less than termination,"" Torres said in the statement Friday.

Torres and New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson said the council will hold a public hearing on the matter in the coming weeks.

How Georgia could leave U.S. Senate control unclear until January,['David Morgan'],"By David Morgan

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The state of Georgia is playing an unusual power-broker role in the knife-edge balance-of-power struggle playing out between Democrats and Republicans over the U.S. Senate following Tuesday's elections. Georgia's two Senate seats, unusually, were both up for election this year, and both races are headed for run-off elections on Jan. 5 after no candidate in either race managed to win a majority of the votes.

As election results stand as of Friday, the Democrats and the Republicans will each hold 48 seats in the 100-member Senate. Two other races in addition to Georgia are still outstanding, but both are widely expected to be won by Republicans.

With the Georgia runoff set for Jan. 5, that will leave the question of which party will control the Senate unanswered until after the rest of the new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3.





WHY WERE BOTH GEORGIA SENATE SEATS ON THE BALLOT?

Republican Senator David Perdue was up for re-election, according to the regular six-year Senate cycle. He was first elected in 2014 and is now in a tight contest against Democrat Jon Ossoff, an investigative journalist and media executive.

Each fell short of the 50%-plus-one-vote threshold, with Perdue getting 49.8% of the vote and Ossoff 47.9%, and they will face each other in a run-off, according to Edison Research on Friday.

Georgia's other senator, Republican Kelly Loeffler, was appointed in 2019 to succeed Johnny Isakson, who retired. Her seat was up for grabs in a special election that drew 21 candidates, including Republican U.S. Representative Doug Collins.

Democrat Raphael Warnock emerged with the greatest share of the vote, at 32.7%, with Loeffler drawing 26% and Collins 20.1%. The winner of the runoff election in that race will serve only two years, filling out the remainder of the six-year term that Isakson had been elected to in 2016.





HOW COMMON ARE RUNOFF ELECTIONS AMONG U.S. STATES?

Several U.S. states including Georgia require runoff elections for primary contests that produce no clear winner.

Story continues

But Georgia became one of the few states to apply runoffs to general elections, after a gubernatorial race in 1966 failed to produce a clear winner and a state legislature dominated by Democrats chose their own candidate over a Republican who had won a slightly larger plurality of voters.





WHY WOULD GEORGIA'S RUN-OFFS AFFECT CONTROL OF THE SENATE?

Democrats failed to generate the ""blue wave"" of voters they hoped for on Nov. 3 but won enough Senate races to pick up a 48th seat in the 100-member Senate. Republicans look likely to keep 50 seats before the Georgia runoffs, if Republicans are re-elected in the races in North Carolina and Alaska that have not yet been called. The Republican candidates are leading in the vote counts in both of those states.

Democrats would face long odds in winning both Senate seats in traditionally Republican-leaning Georgia, but if they do succeed and Joe Biden wins the White House, that would give a Vice President Kamala Harris a 51st tie-breaking vote.

That would be a huge prize for Democrats, because otherwise a Republican-controlled Senate would have the power to block most of Biden's policy priorities. It sets the stage for an intense two months of campaigning as money, political operatives and the news media pour into Georgia.

Steve Bannon's defense counsel told a federal judge on Friday that it was withdrawing from the case.

The news comes after Bannon called for beheading Dr. Anthony Fauci and Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI.

Bannon was arrested in August and charged with fraud in connection with a fundraiser to build a wall along the southern border.

Steve Bannon, who faces charge of defrauding donors to right-wing causes, has lost his defense counsel after publicly calling for the murder of top US infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci and Chris Wray, director of the FBI.

In a Nov. 6 letter to US District Judge Analis Torres, attorney William Burck said that his firm, Quinn Emanuel, ""intends to move to withdraw"" from the case.

The news comes less than 24 hours after Bannon said President Trump should behead government employees he perceives as disloyal. ""I'd put the heads on pikes,"" he said on his podcast. ""I'd put them at the two corners of the White House as a warning to federal bureaucrats.""

Twitter immediately suspended an account linked to the podcast. YouTube and Facebook also removed videos of the episode from their platform, although neither has removed the show itself.

Bannon was arrested in August and charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Prosecutors accuse him of misusing funds raised to build a wall along the southern border.

Rapper King Von fatally shot in Atlanta,"['Tim Fitzsimons', 'Phil Helsel']","Rapper King Von and another man were fatally shot after gunfire erupted outside an Atlanta hookah bar early Friday, authorities said.

Two Atlanta police officers, one of whom was off-duty and working at the hookah bar, confronted the shooters and more gunfire followed, police said.

Atlanta police said they do not believe King Von, whose real name is Dayvon Bennett, was killed by police, but was shot in the initial gunfire between the two groups.

""At this time, our investigators believe Mr. Bennett was shot during the initial shootout between the two groups of males, prior to police responding and attempting to stop the shooting,"" police said in a statement. He was taken to a hospital by private vehicle and was not among the victims found at the scene, police said.

The shooting erupted around 3:20 a.m. outside the Monaco Hookah Lounge, when two groups started to argue, according to officials. ""The argument quickly escalated to gunfire,"" police said in a statement.

Six people in all were shot, including one who was said to be in ""extremely critical condition."" Three others were being treated at area hospitals and described as stable.

Two suspects who were detained are expected to be charged, police said. Authorities had previously said that three people had been killed, but that was later revised.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said that officers fired shots at two locations. The agency said that the six people who were shot were men. The officers were not injured. The GBI is conducting an independent investigation into the police shooting.

Atlanta police said that part of the investigation will be to determine which of the victims were shot by what they described as the suspects, and whether anyone was shot by the officers.

King Von, a native of Chicago, has been described as an up-and-coming rapper. Last week, he released the album ""Welcome To O'Block."" His representatives said in a statement that he ""emerged from difficult circumstances to become one music's most promising stars,"" Billboard reported.

Supreme Court's Alito tells Pennsylvania counties to separate late ballots,['Andrew Chung'],"By Andrew Chung

(Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito on Friday night ordered county election boards in Pennsylvania to comply with a state directive to separate mail-in ballots received after 8 p.m. on Election Day from other ballots.

The order came in a case pending before the justices to invalidate a September decision by the state's highest court that allowed election officials to count mail-in ballots postmarked by Tuesday's Election Day that are delivered through Friday. Alito granted the request by Pennsylvania Republicans to separate the ballots without first referring the request to the other justices.

The decision comes as Democrat Joe Biden edged closer to winning the White House on Friday, expanding his narrow leads over President Donald Trump in battleground states including Pennsylvania.

The Supreme Court had twice rebuffed Pennsylvania Republicans in the case, rejecting a request in October to block the lower court ruling and later refusing to fast-track their consideration of an appeal. The justices said they might revisit the case after Nov. 3.

In its request on Friday, the Republican Party of Pennsylvania said it was unclear whether all 67 county election boards were complying with Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar's Oct. 28 directive to separate late-arriving ballots. Late-arriving ballots are a tiny proportion of the overall vote in the state, Boockvar has said.

The request said 25 counties had not indicated whether they were separating the disputed ballots, which would be necessary in case the Supreme Court ultimately agrees to hear the case and overturns the deadline extension.

The Trump campaign has sought to intervene in the case, but the justices have not yet acted on that request.

Also on Friday, a federal judge in Nevada rejected a bid by a voter, a member of the media and two candidate campaigns to block the use of a signature-verification system in populous Clark County and to provide ""meaningful"" public access to vote counting.

Criminal justice reformer unseats Los Angeles district attorney,"['Alicia Victoria Lozano', 'Dennis Romero']","After a bitter race to lead the largest district attorney's office in the nation, reform candidate and former San Francisco D.A. George Gascón unseated Los Angeles County's first Black chief prosecutor.

With nearly 800,000 ballots still to be counted in Tuesday's election, Jackie Lacey conceded to Gascón on Friday in an emotional address attended by her staff and supporters.

""My consultants tell me that while I may close the gap between the two of us, I will not be able to make up enough based on the trending of the ballots to win this election,"" Lacey said. “I am so thankful to God for giving me this incredible opportunity to serve the people of Los Angeles County.”

The contest was regarded by many, and even Lacey herself, as an extension of the social unrest that spread across the country after George Floyd died in May while in Minneapolis police custody.

Lacey, who was also the county’s first female district attorney, acknowledged that “what happened in my election may one day be listed as a consequence of that” movement.

“It may be said that one day the results of this election is a result of our season of discontent and a demand to see a tsunami of change,” she said.

Gascón, a former Los Angeles police officer who oversaw reforms in the department following the Rampart corruption scandal of the 1990s, will lead an office with 1,000 lawyers and 300 investigators, and has billed himself as a steward for change.

He helped create the state’s first independent bureau to bring more transparency to investigations involving alleged police brutality, and he promised on Friday to reshape the prosecutor's office and hold law enforcement accountable for unjustified killings.

“Angelenos spoke loud and clear,” he said. “We need to start moving away from political rhetoric, and I think that we need to join hands.”

Lacey received mounting pressure from reform advocates in recent years, becoming the target of weekly protests led by Black Lives Matter-Los Angeles that largely focused on her cozy relationship with law enforcement and an unwillingness to prosecute police officers shown to have used excessive force.

Story continues

Tensions between Lacey and BLM-L.A. escalated earlier this year when her husband pulled a gun on the organization’s co-founder Melina Adbullah. David Allan Lacey was charged in August by the California attorney general’s office with three counts of assault with a firearm, and he pleaded not guilty in October.

Abdullah previously told NBC that BLM-L.A. “had tried everything” to form a better relationship with Lacey, but the prosecutor repeatedly refused to meet with Adbullah in person or with the families of people who have been killed by law enforcement officers.

Gascón, on the other hand, has already reached out to Black Lives Matter-L.A. and promised to meet with victims’ families as early as next week, Abdullah said. While Abdullah credits Gascón for being willing to work with criminal justice reform advocates, the Black Lives Matter movement is not prepared to give him a free pass, she said.

“We are holding him accountable,” Abdullah said. “It doesn’t mean he’s going to be doing everything right, but we’re already seeing a corner be turned in the way we’re going to be interacting with him.”

Gascón, who immigrated to Los Angeles from Cuba as a teenager, was a longtime member of the Los Angeles Police Department before becoming chief of police in Mesa, Arizona in 2006. Then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom named him police chief of his city in 2009, and two years later Gascón filled the San Francisco district attorney's seat vacated by U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris when she became California Attorney General.

Lacey heavily criticized Gascón for not prosecuting police officers involved in killings during his eight-year tenure in San Francisco. He defended his decisions by saying all the victims were armed and the law strongly favored police.

Gascón also pushed back by citing Lacey’s own record of prosecuting only one manslaughter case against a law enforcement officer out of 340 fatal shootings during her two terms in office. He pointed to the $7 million Lacey’s campaign received from police unions in her bid for re-election.

Gascón, meanwhile, pulled in $12 million, mainly from wealthy donors bent on criminal justice reform, The Associated Press reported. Billionaire George Soros gave $2.25 million, and philanthropist Patty Quillin, who’s married to Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, gave $1.6 million, according to the Los Angeles Times. Hastings gave $500,000."

Two men were arrested on Thursday near the Convention Center in Philadelphia where votes are currently being counted.

Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said the men, driving a silver Hummer from Virginia, were carrying firearms without a permit.

""We will be requesting that both be held without eligibility for bail when they are arraigned later this evening, as this alarming incident is still very much under investigation,"" Krasner said.

Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.

Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner announced criminal charges on Friday against two men accused of bring firearms, including an AR-15-style rifle, to the city's convention center, where votes are currently being tallied.

On Thursday, local television station WPVI reported that Philadelphia police had received a tip about a group coming from Virginia with plans to ""attack the Convention Center.""

In his statement a day later, Krasner said cops ""spotted a silver Hummer SUV with Virginia tags"" parked near the building. Police then arrested two armed men, Joshua Macias and Antonio LaMotta, after ""an initial investigation determined that neither had a valid Pennsylvania firearms permit to carry.""

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the FBI was alerted to the alleged threat by someone in Norfolk, Virginia.

Macias co-founded the group Vets for Trump, The Washington Post reported. The group's chairman, Vlad Lemets, defending him and LaMotta, a member of the group, saying that ""all they wanted to do was scope out terrain.""

LaMotta's mother told the Post that her son ""loved Republicans"" and ""love Trump very much.""

""He didn't want Trump to lose,"" she said.

Police confiscated two semi-automatic pistols, an AR-15-style rifle, and ammunition, Krasner said.

""We will be requesting that both be held without eligibility for bail when they are arraigned later this evening,"" he added, ""as this alarming incident is still very much under investigation.""

Story continues

In an interview on MSNBC, Krasner said that, as he understands it, the men took off for Philadlephia after President Trump gaving a speech baselessly alleging electoral fraud.

""The greatest domestic terror threat is white men of extreme right-wing affiliation,"" he said, while adding that ""we shouldn't blow this up"" and assume ""this was necessarily more than people who are frankly frightened to go into any city... unless they have firearms at their ready.""

NBC Bay Area video shows an SUV in the driveway of the Brentwood, California, residence with a smashed windshield after vandals struck about midnight. The home's garage was painted with graffiti that described Trump with an epithet.

The vandalism, including tossed eggs, was reported after protests decrying the effigy broke out Thursday night and police blocked the adjacent street in response, the station said. No arrests were reported.

The Contra Costa District Attorney's Office determined no criminal act had taken place when the Biden mannequin was displayed, spokesman Scott Alonso said.

Brentwood police said the results of its inquiry into the matter would nonetheless be forwarded to the U.S. Secret Service. The Secret Service, which is charged with protecting presidents and nominees, does not comment on potential investigations, spokeswoman Julia McMurray said."
Two men charged with gun offenses near Philadelphia vote counting center,"['Ted Hesson', 'Ned Parker']","By Ted Hesson and Ned Parker

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two men were charged with gun offenses in Philadelphia on Friday after they were arrested the previous night near a vote counting site that has become a focal point for election-related protests, according to the city district attorney's office.

Antonio LaMotta, 61, and Joshua Macias, 41, allegedly drove to Philadelphia from Virginia in a Hummer SUV and had two loaded semi-automatic handguns, one semi-automatic AR-15 style rifle and ammunition, the district attorney's office said.

Pennsylvania has become one of a handful of states that could decide the U.S. presidential election following Tuesday's vote. If Democrat Joe Biden can retain a narrow lead in that state over Republican President Donald Trump, it would give him the presidency.

Protesters supporting both candidates have gathered outside the Pennsylvania Convention Center in recent days for what have been largely peaceful demonstrations.

LaMotta and Macias were each charged with carrying a concealed firearm, a felony, and carrying a firearm on public streets or property, a misdemeanor.

Local media reports showed stickers on the suspects' vehicle promoting QAnon, a pro-Trump online conspiracy theory. The unfounded theory posits that Trump is secretly fighting a global cabal of child-sex predators that includes prominent Democrats, Hollywood elites and ""deep state"" allies.

Facebook and Twitter accounts that appeared to belong to LaMotta show numerous postings related to the conspiracy theory.

""QAnon is a positive military operation that is working to take down the deep state,"" reads one April Facebook post.

Anita LaMotta, the suspect's mother, told Reuters in a telephone interview that he had traveled to Philadelphia because ""he wanted to help"" in the event riots broke out.

LaMotta and Macias did not respond to requests for comment. It was not immediately clear whether they have attorneys.

Macias billed himself online as a strategic adviser for a grassroots group called Vets for Trump. A group spokesman said Macias was no longer affiliated with them.

"2 men arrested near Philadelphia vote center had QAnon paraphernalia, AR-15 in car","['Tom Winter', 'Ben Collins', 'Daniel Arkin', 'Brandy Zadrozny']","Two armed men were arrested Thursday near the Philadelphia convention center where votes were being tallied, police said.

The men — a 61-year-old and a 42-year-old — traveled to the city from Virginia in a silver Hummer, and they were arrested after the FBI field office in Norfolk, Virginia, received a tip about their plans, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said at a news conference Friday.

Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner identified the men on Friday night as Joshua Macias and Antonio Lamotta, both of Chesapeake, Va., and said they were in custody after being arrested by Philadelphia police outside of the Convention Center.

Police said they found the car parked and unoccupied around 10:20 p.m., and about seven minutes later, two police officers on bicycles saw the two men in possession of firearms.

Officers saw that one man had a Beretta 9mm pistol holstered on his hip, and the other man appeared to have a concealed Beretta .40 caliber handgun, according to Outlaw. They also had an AR-15 style weapon in their truck, with approximately 160 rounds of ammunition.

Police said the men, who did not have valid Pennsylvania firearms licenses, would be charged with firearms offenses. They were set to be arraigned. It was not immediately clear if they had retained lawyers who could comment on their behalf.

The men may also face election law violations, according to officials.

Krasner said the duo are not known to be connected to any extremist groups, adding that “we do not have indications that the story is bigger than these two individuals.”

Krasner said there were some QAnon stickers on the car and that a hat with a QAnon logo was visible inside the vehicle. QAnon is a conspiracy theory that posits President Donald Trump is leading a secret war against a group of political and Hollywood elites who worship Satan and abuse and murder children.

Social media profiles that match Lamotta's name and included pictures of the silver Hummer and stickers suggest he was a supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory. On his Facebook page, which was removed by early Friday morning, Lamotta posted about QAnon “as a positive military operation” and suggested a judgement day was fast-approaching. On Twitter, Lamotta posted signed drawings of cartoons that included anti-Semitic tropes and depicted Trump as a machine-gun carrying hero.

Story continues

A fundraiser opened in July by Lamotta for “Virginia Armed Patriots” was also removed early Friday morning from GoFundMe.

Social media profiles tied to Macias' name mentioned the ""Stop the Steal"" campaign, a group which was banned from Facebook Thursday due to repeated calls for violence.

Some QAnon followers have become agitated since Election Day, and some called for armed conflict, as long-promised prophecies about a landslide Trump victory and mass arrests of Democrats did not come to pass. Q, the fictional government insider who leads the QAnon movement on the extremist forum 8kun, has not posted since about 17 hours before the first polls closed on Election Day.

Q's last post before the election was vague, included a link to the theme song to the 1992 movie ""The Last of the Mohicans,"" and did not offer any explanation for years of failed predictions. Hours later, 8kun administrator Ron Watkins, who is the son of 8kun's owner Jim Watkins, resigned.

Some major QAnon influencers, who sell books and subscription content services, attempted to keep the faith of their followers by pushing elaborate voter fraud conspiracies, imploring increasingly anxious adherents to ""trust the plan."""

Two groups of men got into an altercation around 3:20 a.m. outside Atlanta’s Monaco Hookah Lounge. The Chicago rapper was wounded and taken to the hospital where he later passed away, per the Chicago Sun Times.

“He was a devoted father, a deeply loyal friend, and a man who took care of his people before himself,” said his publicist, Erin Ryan, in a statement. “We are heartbroken for his family, his friends, his team, and his fans. Long live King Von.”

Off-duty Atlanta police officers who were posted at the lounge as security and an on-duty officer patrolling nearby fired shots as well, while responding to the confrontation between the two groups. TMZ reports the bullet that hit King Von was not from an officer’s gun but the incident is being investigated by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and Atlanta police.

In that incident, a man was “seriously injured” per the AJC. King Von was arrested in Atlanta again a few months later on an aggravated battery charge.

Biden taps Gensler to work on Wall Street oversight review - source,"['Trevor Hunnicutt', 'Michelle Price']","By Trevor Hunnicutt and Michelle Price

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who appeared to be closing in on an election victory, has tapped former derivatives market regulator Gary Gensler to work on a transition plan for financial industry oversight, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.

Gensler, who served as chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) from 2009 to 2014, will work with a team of policy experts focused on banking and markets regulators, such as the CFTC, Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as part of the usual agency review process undertaken by an incoming administrations, the person said.

Gensler did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday evening. A spokesperson for Biden's transition team declined to comment.

The decision to appoint Gensler was likely to please many Democrats who applauded his tough stance on Wall Street under former President Barack Obama.

As CFTC chair, he led creation of key swaps rules mandated by Congress following the 2007-2009 financial crisis, developing a reputation as a hard-headed operator who was not afraid to ruffle feathers.

His efforts put the CFTC well ahead on the implementation of the 2010 Dodd-Frank reform law. Other regulators are still implementing the law's rules a decade later.

A former Goldman Sachs banker and currently a professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, Gensler also oversaw the prosecution of big investment banks for rigging Libor, the benchmark for trillions of dollars in lending worldwide.

Biden's team has also tapped KeyBank NA executive Don Graves to work on a broader economic agency review, the same person said. Graves could not immediately be reached for comment but on his LinkedIn page describes himself as a counselor to Biden.

Before joining KeyBank in 2017, Graves worked in the Obama administration Biden's director of domestic and economic policy. Before that he was executive director of Obama's jobs council, according to his LinkedIn.

Biden, who leads incumbent Republican President Donald Trump in the key battleground states, according to several television networks, was accused of being too cozy with Wall Street as a senator and later as Obama’s vice president. He has said relatively little on financial reform more broadly.

His appointees are expected to prioritize policies on which Democrats broadly agree - boosting consumer protections and measures to help tackle racial injustice, diversity, wealth inequality and climate change.

One area Biden has focused on are rules that promote lending to low-income communities, which he has pledged to expand. He has also pledged to crack down on credit reporting agencies which are criticized for harming consumers with inaccurate reports and by focusing on scoring factors that disadvantage minorities.

"Rapper King Von, 26, fatally shot in Atlanta","['Tim Fitzsimons', 'Phil Heslel', 'Samantha Kubota']","Rapper King Von was shot and killed early Friday outside an Atlanta hookah bar, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. One other person was killed, and a third was in ""extremely critical condition,"" Atlanta police said.

""The preliminary investigation indicates that Dayvon Bennett, aka King Von, and a group of men left the Opium Nightclub and went to the Monaco Hookah Lounge on 255 Trinity Avenue,"" GBI said in a statement.

""Once there, two men approached the group in the parking lot, and the two groups of men started to argue with each other,"" officials said. ""The argument quickly escalated to gunfire between the two groups.""

GBI said Atlanta Police Department officers — on- and off-duty — responded and one of each fired shots at two locations.

Atlanta police said they believe that King Von was not killed by Atlanta police, but rather died in the gunfire between the two groups before officers arrived.

""We are seeing rumors being spread indicating he was shot and killed by APD officers. At this time, our investigators believe Mr. Bennett was shot during the initial shootout between the two groups of males, prior to police responding and attempting to stop the shooting,"" Atlanta police said in a statement.

Six people in all were shot, including King Von and the other person who died, police said. That person is not identified in the police statement. One male victim was in extremely critical condition and three others were described as stable.

Two people described as suspects were also detained, and police expect they will be charged, Atlanta police said.

The investigation into the incident ""remains open and very active"" and will determine whether anyone was shot by the officers, police said.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation initially said three people were killed.

NBA star LeBron James tweeted condolences on Friday, noting the impact King Von's music had on him and his sons.

"Baby turtles for sale: Cops shut down Pittsburgh business, but why is it illegal?",['Tj Macias'],"Pittsburgh police busted a business that was allegedly selling turtle hatchlings — which is illegal — authorities posted on Twitter.

Police executed a search warrant for a business on the 2600 block of Brownsville Road. The business was illegally selling turtle hatchlings. The Humane Animal Rescue took possession of the reptiles. Anyone with knowledge of animal abuse or neglect are asked to call police. pic.twitter.com/4TxphHCyVI — Pittsburgh Police (@PghPolice) November 6, 2020

In the tweet, officers said that the Humane Animal Rescue took possession of the tiny turtles after authorities executed a search warrant in the 2600 block of Brownsville Road.

The United States made it illegal to sell baby turtles (or small turtles) smaller than 4-inches long as pets in 1975 because they “harbor salmonella, a bacterium that causes a highly unpleasant and occasionally deadly illness in humans,” NPR said.

Before the ban there were an estimated 250,000 cases of Samonellosis in children that were tied to pet baby turtles, The Spruce Pets said.

Why just ban the little critters under 4-inches long? Because children are able to put them in their mouths.

“Four inches was chosen with the thought that most young children wouldn’t try to put a turtle larger than this in their mouth (of course, putting a turtle in your mouth isn’t the only way to be infected with Salmonella),” Spruce Pets said. “However, restricting turtle sales to those greater than 4 inches probably also helps reduce the incidence of Salmonellosis by reducing turtle sales, since hatchlings are much more irresistible than larger turtles. Also, kids are probably less inclined to play with the larger turtles in the first place.”

In the last decade, salmonella infections that were linked to the small turtles returned, which alarmed health officials according to NPR.

“From May 2011 through September 2013, turtle-associated salmonella was linked to eight outbreaks across 41 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, covering 473 illnesses,” NPR said. “Some 28 percent of those sickened had to be hospitalized.”"
"Paul Shanley, priest at center of sex scandal, dead at 89",[],"WARE, Mass. (AP) — A former Roman Catholic street priest who played a pivotal role in the sexual abuse scandal that rocked the Archdiocese of Boston has died, authorities said Friday. Paul Shanley was 89.

Police in Ware, a town in west-central Massachusetts where Shanley was living since his release from prison in 2017, confirmed his death but did not say how he died. WFXT-TV, Boston's Fox News affiliate, said he died of heart failure on Oct. 28.

Shanley was a popular priest who counseled gay and troubled youths in the 1960s and 1970s. In 2005, he was convicted of raping a boy at a Newton church in the 1980s and sentenced to 12 years in prison.

Shanley's release in July 2017 triggered a firestorm of protests from some of his victims, who alleged he sexually abused them as children.

Shanley was a notorious figure in the clergy sex abuse scandal that exploded in Boston in 2002, after The Boston Globe revealed that dozens of priests had molested and raped children for decades while church supervisors covered it up and shuffled abusive priests from parish to parish.

The Vatican defrocked Shanley in 2004 after dozens of men came forward and reported being sexually abused by him.

Internal church records that were made public during the scandal contained documents indicating Shanley had attended a forum with others who later went on to form the North American Man-Boy Love Association, or NAMBLA, a pedophile advocacy organization.

The Boston archdiocese, the fourth-largest in the U.S. with more than 1.8 million Catholics, has called Shanley’s crimes against children “reprehensible.”"

U.S. Republicans divided over Trump's election-fraud claims,['Richard Cowan'],"By Richard Cowan

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As President Donald Trump fumes over the unfolding U.S. presidential election results, some of his fellow Republicans in Congress have hinted that he ought to tone down his rhetoric.

Three days after the election, votes are still being tallied in the closely fought battleground states of Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is riding an expanding lead over Trump, a Republican, that could bring him victory.

Amid Trump's repeated and unfounded allegations of election fraud, Senator Roy Blunt, a member of the Republican leadership, told reporters that ""at some point"" the White House will have to be able to take such allegations to court and lay out the evidence.

""I also don't think it's unreasonable for... Biden to accept the unofficial result and do whatever he thinks he should do,"" Blunt added.

That unofficial result could come as early as Friday, with Biden planning an address to the nation in the evening.

Throughout his campaign, Biden said he would work to heal the deep political divisions plaguing the United States. That work could be impeded if Trump convinces at least part of the country that Biden's win was illegitimate.

Some 30% of Republicans accept Trump's claim that he won the election, though a bipartisan majority of Americans do not, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Thursday.

Trump on Thursday said in a White House statement: ""If you count the legal votes I easily win."" Without presenting evidence, he accused Democrats of ""trying to steal an election.""

Some senior Republicans voiced support for the president's claims. House of Representatives Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Fox News: ""President Trump won this election. So everyone who's listening, do not be quiet.""

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, an avid Trump supporter, told Fox News that he was prepared to donate $500,000 to Trump's legal efforts in multiple states.

Story continues

The Republican National Committee is aiming to raise at least $60 million to help finance Trump's legal battles, sources told Reuters.

But other Republicans in Congress were not as excited about a drawn-out battle and its toll on America if it becomes clear that Biden won the election fair and square.

Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, which Trump won handily on Tuesday, echoed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in urging that ballots be counted in accordance with each state's laws.

""I hope we can reach a final resolution as quickly as possible,"" he said in a statement.

Senator Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, knows the agony that can come with defeat. But he castigated Trump for claiming the election was being stolen.

""Doing so damages the cause of freedom here and around the world... and recklessly inflames destructive and dangerous passions,"" Romney said on Twitter."
Philadelphia police investigate bomb threat against vote counting center,['Jeva Lange'],"On Friday, Philadelphia police investigated a bomb threat made against the city's Convention Center, where votes are still being tallied, while also revealing additional information pertaining to arrests made on Thursday related to a possible threat against the same location.

In a news conference, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw confirmed that police arrested two out-of-state men on Thursday following a tip from the FBI that warned ""an individual or a group was traveling to the city from Virginia in a Hummer with the intention of attacking the election location,"" The Independent reports. The men, who are 61 and 42 years old, had traveled to Philadelphia from Virginia in a silver Hummer that sported stickers related to the QAnon conspiracy theory.

Officers stopped the men after noticing that one had a Beretta 9mm pistol and the other had a concealed Beretta .40 caliber handgun, NBC News reports; the men also reportedly had an ""AR-15 style weapon"" in their truck, with ""approximately 160 rounds of ammunition."" The men were arrested and charged for allegedly not having a valid Pennsylvania firearms license.

On Friday afternoon, Philadelphia police further conducted evacuations downtown after bomb threats were made in two calls by the same individual. The police confirmed that the threats were against the Philadelphia Convention Center, but after sweeps of the surrounding area by K9 units, no device had been found as of 3 p.m, the Philly Voice reports.

While both incidents potentially targeted the vote counting center, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said of the Virginia duo who'd been arrested Thursday that ""we do not have indications that the story is bigger than these two individuals."" Philadelphia's ballots have emerged as some of the most pivotal of the election, since its Democratic-leaning returns have put Vice President Joe Biden over the edge in the state, which, if he wins, would deliver him the presidency.

Sexual assault charge against Jacob Blake dismissed in plea bargain agreement,['David K. Li'],"A sexual assault charge against Jacob Blake, the Black man shot in the back by police in August, touching off weeks of protests in Wisconsin, was dropped on Friday, according to court records.

Appearing via Zoom,Blake pleaded guilty to two counts of disorderly conduct and domestic abuse and was sentenced to two years of probation, Kenosha County court records showed.

In the deal, one count of criminal trespassing and one count of third-degree sexual assault and domestic abuse were dropped.

The charges stem from an incident in May, which occurred before police confronted him on Aug. 23. A bystander's cell phone video from the police incident appeared to show Blake trying to walk away from officers before he was shot at close range in the back.

Rusten Sheskey was identified as the officer who shot Blake.

The sexual assault charge stemmed from an incident in May, which was believed to be the reason for his attempted arrest by Kenosha police officers in August.

Blake previously pleaded not guilty to trespassing, sexual assault, and disorderly conduct. The three charges are related to an incident at the home of Blake's girlfriend.

His trial had been set to begin on Monday.

Blake's lawyer and the prosecutor overseeing the case could not be immediately reached for comment late Friday afternoon.

The police shooting of Blake touched off days of protests against police brutality and systemic racism.

Prosecutors say Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Antioch, Illinois, came to Kenosha during the protests and opened fire on two men, Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, killing them both and wounding a third man, Gaige Grosskreutz.

Rittenhouse has been charged with two counts of felony homicide in addition to attempted homicide, possession of a dangerous weapon while under the age of 18 and reckless endangerment, court records show.

Defense lawyers have said Rittenhouse acted in self-defense and that he was there to try to protect businesses."
"Factbox: Trump turns to courts, as Biden inches closer to victory in U.S. election",['Tom Hals'],"By Tom Hals

WILMINGTON, Del (Reuters) - With Democratic challenger Joe Biden taking a lead in Pennsylvania and Georgia and inching closer to victory in the U.S. presidential election on Friday, Republican President Donald Trump has turned to the courts to challenge votes in several states.

Below is a list of the cases that will play out in the coming days and possibly weeks:





PENNSYLVANIA LITIGATION

Several court battles are pending in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.

The Trump campaign sued Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar and county election officials to limit the time election officers have to contact mail-in voters to correct defective ballots.

Separately, two Republican candidates and several voters are seeking to prevent election officials from ""curing"" invalid mail-in ballots. The Commonwealth Court on Friday ordered election officials to set aside provisional ballots cast on Election Day by voters whose absentee or mail-in ballots were received on time.

The Trump campaign is also fighting Philadelphia election officials over vote counting in the city, and the campaign on Thursday was granted better access to the proceedings, which officials have appealed. A similar case filed in federal court was tossed.

On Wednesday, Trump's campaign filed a motion to intervene in a case pending before the U.S. Supreme Court challenging a decision from the state's highest court that allowed election officials to count mail-in ballots postmarked by Tuesday's Election Day that are delivered through Friday.

U.S. Supreme Court justices have said there was not enough time to decide the merits of the case before Election Day but indicated they might revisit it afterwards.

Justice Samuel Alito, joined by fellow conservatives Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, said in a written opinion that there is a ""strong likelihood"" the Pennsylvania court's decision violated the U.S. Constitution.

Pennsylvania election officials said they would segregate properly postmarked ballots that arrived after Election Day.

NEVADA

A voter, a member of the media and two candidate campaigns sued the secretary of state and other officials to prevent the use of a signature-verification system in populous Clark County and to provide public access to vote counting.

Thursday's lawsuit came after Trump campaign officials said they planned to file a lawsuit in the state after alleging without evidence that thousands of improper votes were cast by dead people and by voters who were no longer residents of Clark County, which contains Las Vegas.





GEORGIA BALLOT FIGHT

The Trump campaign on Wednesday filed a lawsuit in state court in Chatham County that alleged late-arriving ballots were improperly mingled with valid ballots, and asked a judge to order late-arriving ballots be separated and not be counted.

The case was dismissed on Thursday.





MICHIGAN BALLOT-COUNTING FIGHT

Trump's campaign on Wednesday filed a lawsuit in Michigan to stop state officials from counting ballots until it has an election inspector at each absentee-voter counting board. The campaign also wanted to review ballots that were opened and counted before an inspector from its campaign was present.

On Thursday, Michigan Court of Claims Judge Cynthia Stephens dismissed the case.





U.S. POSTAL SERVICE LITIGATION

The U.S. Postal Service said about 1,700 ballots had been identified in Pennsylvania at processing facilities during two sweeps Thursday and were being delivered to election officials, according to a court filing early Friday.

The Postal Service said 1,076 ballots, had been found at its Philadelphia Processing and Distribution Center. About 300 were found at the Pittsburgh processing center, 266 at a Lehigh Valley facility and others at other Pennsylvania processing centers.

U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan is overseeing a lawsuit by Vote Forward, the NAACP, and Latino community advocates who have been demanding the Postal Service deliver mail-in ballots in time to be counted in the election.

"She says the sheriff fired her for being gay. Now, she'll be the sheriff",['Dan Avery'],"Charmaine McGuffey, an out lesbian, has been elected sheriff of Hamilton County, Ohio.

McGuffey, 63, made headlines in the primary where she challenged the incumbent, Jim Neil, who fired her from the sheriff’s department three years ago.

Neil insists he terminated McGuffey for creating a hostile work environment.

In a pending lawsuit against the department she will soon lead, McGuffey says she was the one subjected to a toxic workplace.

She maintains it was because she spoke out against excessive force — and because she is an openly gay woman.

Born and raised in Cincinnati, McGuffey said she knew she wanted to be a police officer by the time she was 14. But when she enrolled at the University of Cincinnati in the late 1970s, women weren’t allowed to be uniformed patrol officers.

Charmaine McGuffey, left, with her wife, Christine Sandusky (Tyler Smetts)

That changed by the time McGuffey graduated, and she joined the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office in 1983. Rising through the ranks, she received glowing reviews and numerous accolades over more than three decades of service.

In 2013, McGuffey was promoted to major in command of jail and court services, making her the highest-ranking woman in department history. Under her watch, the Hamilton County Justice Center moved from being Ohio’s worst-ranked large jail to its best in only three years, according to audits by the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation & Corrections.

In 2014, McGuffey was named regional Law Enforcement Officer of the Year, according to her bio, and two years later, the Ohio Chapter of the National Social Workers honored her as Citizen of the Year.

But even during her rise, McGuffey said, she felt singled out in “one of the harshest male-dominated environments you can imagine.”

When she spoke up about the mistreatment of inmates, “I was told to sit down and be quiet,” she told LGBTQ Nation. “I was the major of that jail, so my name’s on that if you guys are going to shove the use of force under the rug …”

Her gender and her sexual orientation were also issues, she said.

Story continues

In one alleged incident, a staffer waved a Trump hat at McGuffey while she was attempting to lead a meeting.

“Everybody burst out laughing,” she told LGBTQ Nation. “It made me feel targeted, made me feel alone. I didn’t like it, but I was getting things done, and I just continued to work.”

After a deputy filed an official complaint alleging she screamed at and belittled subordinates, Neil launched an internal investigation.

The chief investigator determined McGuffey “used her position to retaliate against employees, as well as engaged in favoritism,” according to department records.

To McGuffey, though, the real goal of the investigation was to discredit her.

After more than 30 years, Neil demoted her to a lower-paying civilian job, according to McGuffey’s lawsuit. She refused the lesser role and was fired by the same man who promoted her to head the Hamilton County jail.

She filed a discrimination suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2018. In February of this year, a district court advanced her case to trial, ruling that similar investigations of male, heterosexual officers had resulted in much lesser penalties, or none at all.

It wasn’t the first time McGuffey faced disciplinary action, though. In April 2010, she was brought up on criminal charges stemming from a confrontation with police outside a gay bar in Covington, Kentucky.

McGuffey had been watching a college basketball game with some friends. When the group left around 11 p.m., they were confronted by two patrolmen.

According to her, one of them threatened to arrest her friend for leaving the bar with a beer.

The officers maintained they only asked the friend to discard her beverage, which she did. But, according to a departmental report obtained by the Cincinnati Enquirer, which NBC News has not seen, McGuffey then became “loud and belligerent,” cursing and shouting that the male officers had “problems with gay women.” She was cited for public intoxication, menacing and disorderly conduct.

According to McGuffey, who denied she was acting menacingly, she and her friends were targeted because of their sexual orientation.

“They were horrible. When they found out I was a captain, it became this thing, like, ‘What are we going to do about her?’” she told NBC News. “They pushed me to the ground and handcuffed me. It was absolutely unlawful what they did, and they knew it.”

Ultimately, the charges, all misdemeanors, were dropped. But the sheriff’s office disciplined her for “conduct unbecoming” and suspended her for five days without pay.

Until then, McGuffey had been closeted at work.

“I was always terrified that the sheriff would find out and I would lose my job,” she said, alleging that the decision to discipline her was also fueled by homophobia.

“Being outed — it was such a harsh, awful experience,” she said. “But being able to be out? That was tremendous. As the highest ranking woman in the sheriff’s office, marching with my wife at Pride was one of the best days of my life.”

After being fired in 2017, McGuffey nursed her pride for a year and a half. Then she decided she could do Neil’s job better herself.

She declared her candidacy in May 2019, promising her election would mean “our country is moving forward.”

Endorsed by Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., and countless civil rights groups, McGuffey won the April Democratic primary against Neil handily with 70 percent of the vote.

Neil crossed party lines to endorse her general election opponent, Republican Bruce Hoffbauer. In an op-ed for the Cincinnati Enquirer declaring his support for Hoffbauer, Neil said McGuffey “would use the office of sheriff to be a political activist, pushing an anti-law enforcement agenda,” while he referred to Hoffbauer as a “tried and true law enforcement leader dedicated to public safety.”

On Tuesday, McGuffey defeated Hoffbauer 52 percent to 48 percent.

“I’ve lived here my whole life — people know me,” she said. “I have been out in the community in uniform, helping people. I’ve never strayed from those core values. It served me through his attacks.”

Neil declined NBC News’ request for comment.

Her victory isn’t just a vindication, she said. It represents hope. “Not just for the LGBTQ community, but for the Black and brown communities, for people of color. It means we can achieve.”

McGuffey will be the first LGBTQ sheriff in Hamilton County, as well as the first woman to serve in that role. And in a nation so divided, she said, that’s “a ray of sunshine through the clouds.” “I’ve been hearing from so many people, not just in Hamilton County, but across the nation. They’re glad to have some hope.”

When she takes office in January, she said her first priority will be making sure everyone she’s sworn to protect believes the justice system works for them.

“I know what it feels like to be targeted,” she said at a press conference Wednesday morning. “I know what it feels like to be the only woman in the room. I’ve seen a system that does not allow diversity in the upper echelons of law enforcement.”

And she wants to close the door on the divisiveness of the past.

“I’ve ordered a bunch of wood, because I plan on building a lot of bridges,” she said.

Head of U.S. agency overseeing nuclear weapons stockpile resigns,[],"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the agency that oversees the U.S. stockpile of nuclear weapons has resigned, the U.S. Energy Department's National Nuclear Security Administration said on Friday, without providing a reason.

Lisa Gordon-Hagerty resigned as administrator of the NNSA, a semi-autonomous branch of the department.

William Bookless is now serving as NNSA's acting administrator, it said in a statement. He had been serving as NNSA's principal deputy administrator for the last year-and-a-half.

The action drew criticism from Senator James Inhofe, Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee who praised Gordon-Hagerty and harshly criticized Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette.

""That the Secretary of Energy effectively demanded her resignation during this time of uncertainty demonstrates he doesn’t know what he’s doing in national security matters and shows a complete lack of respect for the semi-autonomous nature of NNSA,"" Inhofe said in a statement.

Brouillette's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Gordon-Hagerty became the first woman to serve as administrator when she took up her post in early 2018.

NNSA oversees the development and maintenance of nuclear weapons, but not the delivery systems, which are managed by the Department of Defense.

DefenseNews was first to report Gordon-Hagerty's resignation. The news outlet said she had clashed over her budget with Brouillette.

Gordon-Hagerty had proposed a record budget of nearly $20 billion for fiscal year 2021 to help pay for modernization of the nuclear weapons stockpile, which is expected to cost more than $1.2 trillion over 30 years.

Brouillette had backed a budget of $17.5 billion proposed by the Office of Management and Budget, a White House office. President Donald Trump later sided with Gordon-Hagerty for a budget of nearly $20 billion.

Should all drugs be decriminalized?,['Mike Bebernes'],"“The 360” shows you diverse perspectives on the day’s top stories and debates.

What’s happening

Oregon will become the first state in the nation to decriminalize illicit drugs — including opioids, meth and cocaine — after voters approved a ballot measure on Tuesday.

When enacted, the proposal will remove criminal penalties for possession and use of small amounts of drugs. Drugs will still be illegal, but offenders will be given the option of paying a $100 fine or attending a health assessment at an addiction treatment center rather than jail time. Selling and manufacturing drugs will remain criminal acts. The measure will also divert money that historically was used to enforce drug laws to fund drug addiction treatment programs.

As marijuana laws have gradually been eliminated across the country— including several states that voted for legalization in this election — drug reform advocates have been pursuing new ways to roll back laws passed as part of the war on drugs, which has contributed to a massive increase in incarceration in the U.S. over the past four decades. On Tuesday, Oregon voters also approved a separate measure to legalize the use of psilocybin mushrooms, aka magic mushrooms, for medical purposes.

No state in the U.S. has decriminalized hard drugs, but Oregon’s proposal is similar to policies that have been in place in Portugal for nearly two decades.

Why there’s debate

Supporters of decriminalizing drugs say it’s a crucial step in reversing the damage caused by overly punitive anti-drug laws that have put millions of people, especially people of color, in jail while doing little to remedy substance abuse. Drug use, they argue, should be seen as a public health crisis, not a criminal justice issue. Decriminalizing drugs could save lives by removing the barriers that block many from accessing addiction treatment and freeing up resources for preventing violence that stems from the drug trade.

Overdose deaths have decreased dramatically in Portugal since it decriminalized drug use in 2001, and HIV infections fell as well. The country also hasn’t seen a spike in overall drug use, as many decriminalization skeptics had feared.

Story continues

Opponents of decriminalization argue that removing criminal penalties will make people, especially children, more likely to experiment with illicit drugs and eventually become addicted. Reduced enforcement of low-level drug offenses may also cause an increase in violent crime, they argue.

Others say the threat of jail time can be an important tool for motivating drug users to enroll in addiction treatment programs, which are often offered as an alternative to incarceration. Some reform advocates say that decriminalization on its own won’t make much of a difference unless it’s paired with a substantial investment in other harm reduction measures.

What’s next

Drug decriminalization will go into effect in Oregon on Feb. 1. The movement to reform drug laws is poised to press forward in many states and possibly nationally. Joe Biden has pledged to decriminalize marijuana nationwide and reduce penalties for some drug crimes if he’s elected president.

Perspectives

Decriminalizing drugs would save money and save lives

“While no policy or program is a panacea, evidence-based measures can reduce harm and save lives. One such measure is the decriminalization of drugs, which evidence suggests facilitates treatment for those who want it, helps efficiently direct scarce health-care and justice-system resources, and ultimately saves lives.” — David Moscrop, Washington Post

Decriminalization would lead to an increase in violent crime

“Stealing money and property to fund the addiction is a motivation listed in criminal complaints all too often; those same complaints often include child neglect and disorderly conduct. If possession alone is ignored or just a slap on the wrist, there is nothing to stop more serious crimes from happening in the future.” — John Sloca, Kenosha News (Wisc.)

Drug abuse is a public health problem, not a criminal one

“Substance abuse has been designated by the American Medical Association as a medical diagnosis, not a moral failure, for 40 years. Yet we continue to deal with it as a criminal offense, declaring a war on drugs, with punishment rather than effective evidence-based medical treatment.” — John French, Statesman Journal (Salem, Ore.)

The legal process provides an important path to addiction treatment

“Most people struggling with addiction can’t stop using drugs on their own. If they could, they wouldn’t be addicted. However, many people in long-term recovery credit the motivation of court diversion programs with ‘saving my life’ or ‘rescuing me from myself.’” — Heather Jefferis and Se-ah-dom Edmo, the Oregonian

Decriminalization on its own can’t fix things

“To substantially shift the experiences of people who use drugs in their communities, decriminalization must be coupled with meaningful police reform and efforts to build-up systems of support and care. This is because police take advantage of wide discretion, continuing to surveil and control people who use drugs.” — Public health researcher Leo Beletsky to the Appeal

The harms of punitive drug laws are worse than what decriminalization may bring

“In drug policy, there are many trade-offs. Though we may not have strong evidence that drug decriminalization alone is widely beneficial, we also lack compelling evidence of benefits from criminalizing drug use, which costs the United States billions of dollars annually, much of it because of incarceration.” — Austin Frakt, New York Times

Harsh drug laws perpetuate the cycle of addiction

“Incarceration for addiction makes matters much worse for everyone and exacerbates the untreated health complications of those with addiction. Without access to drug treatment and recovery services, the cycle of drug use/jail time/and back on the street continues, with no support to help people find a way out.” — Robert A. Lowe and Ray G. Stangeland, Oregonian

We shouldn't promote the idea that drug use is OK

“Sending a message that this is just a medical problem is not the right way to go. We have to let the public know that this is something that should not be encouraged, it should be discouraged.” — Luke Niforators, Fox News

People should be free to use drugs if they want to

“Americans should be free to ingest whatever they choose — cigarette smoke, trans fats, mega-sodas, and/or methamphetamine. I’m skeptical that [a] significant number of people will begin shooting heroin simply because possession of small amounts of the drug have been decriminalized. We already enforce our drug laws arbitrarily.” — David Harsanyi, National Review

8 things our next president needs to do right away,[],"What a draining week that was.

And what an uncertain time we have going forward.

I am writing this as of early morning Saturday, November 7, important to note, because the course of the election and indeed our nation could shift at any moment.

Still, I’m going to go out on a bit of a limb and say Joe Biden will be our next president. Donald Trump is now behind in Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, and Pennsylvania (which if he won, would add to his electoral vote total and give him 306) by a combined 88,000 votes. (Never mind his 4.1 million-plus deficit in the popular vote.) That’s simply too steep of a mountain for Trump to climb. I understand he is going to challenge and fight the results everywhere, but on what grounds? So far there’s no there, there. And remember he would have to beat or overturn current results in all four states.

“Besides the lawyers making money and the Trump base making noise or worse, it’s hard to see what the claim is,” says Mark Graber, a constitutional law professor at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law. “A lot of it is simply throwing mud and hoping something sticks.”

For those of you keeping score, (and who isn’t), one key deadline for challenging the election is December 14 when the state electors (to the Electoral College) meet in their respective state capitals to formally vote for the president and vice president. Back in the contested election of 2000 you may recall, the Supreme Court ruled in Bush v. Gore on December 12, right before that deadline (more on that election later.) But this mess could end being resolved later in Congress, like it did in the hotly contested election of 1876, when Rutherford B. Hayes was finally named the winner by special commission after a bitter fight.

This combination of pictures created on November 06, 2020 shows Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on November 2, 2020 in Cleveland, Ohio and US President Donald Trump on November 2, 2020, in Fayetteville, North Carolina.

The president has been telling us for quite some time this was coming. That he would only lose if there was fraud and illegal voting, and therefore he would fight to the end. Of course some have suggested that fear of litigation post-presidency is making him that much more dogged.

Story continues

It remains to be seen how long and how far the GOP will stick with the president in this battle, as scorching the earth could irreparably harm the nation and their party. At what point do a majority of Republicans think Trump is just a sore loser who needs to give up the ghost?

So I may be getting ahead of myself as we could be in for a long slog here, (or maybe not—who knows), but after all is said and done, I believe Biden will be inaugurated on Wednesday, January 20, 2021. If I’m wrong, you can file this under “Dewey defeats Truman” and troll me for the next four years.

And by the way, the stock market seems remarkably sanguine about the week’s events. Stocks rebounded sharply since Election Day, with the S&P climbing some 6.9%—the best week since April, after falling sharply the week before—the worst five days since March. That surge in stock prices was about perhaps finally this election coming to an end (not so fast there now), and also the notion that Biden would win but the GOP would hold the Senate (likely, but also unresolved), creating a mixed government with little mandate to interfere in the workings of business. I would not expect another leg up from here for stocks until this is all resolved, but who knows. Last week’s action was a textbook lesson in not trying to time the market.

So, accepting my not-so-little caveat about Biden ultimately winning, what should Biden do upon becoming president two months hence, given that he will be facing a nation that is deeply divided and still fighting a raging pandemic? Here are my thoughts.

(By the way, if Trump somehow does stay in office, he could take on these priorities too, but as you will see, in many instances he couldn’t or wouldn’t.)

COVID-19

The case count is soaring—up to 132,000 yesterday—the worst levels ever, and yet the pandemic was put on the back burner this past week. Tragically this may continue until the election is figured out. Day one for the new president—and I am sure he’ll have this planned out in advance—we need a national program with flexible regional policies and authority for fighting the pandemic. We need clear and consistent messaging. The federal government needs to fund and take charge of testing and make “rapid testing” a redundancy. We need a system for contact tracing. We should wear masks in public and limit the size of social gatherings. Next, and again, I’m sure he’s got this, Biden needs to ready a plan to distribute vaccines as well as therapeutics not just in the U.S., but for the world (yes we’re going to get some globalism back here, see below.) We need to re-engage with the WHO, re-empower the CDC, and ask Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, if he will officially become our COVID-19 Czar.

Reach across the aisle

First of all I understand this whole narrative of “Donald Trump got 70 million votes, Donald Trump isn’t going away, Donald Trump TV is coming and Donald Trump 2024.” To be sure, Donald Trump is a-once-in-a-generation Pied Piper. That was true of Republican Senator Joe McCarthy too back in the 1950s but eventually people just became tired of his song and dance. Biden needs to reach out to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell—they’ve known each other for decades—and remind him that when Trump is gone, their next candidate—Vice President Mike Pence, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nation Nikki Haley, Senator Ted Cruz etc, none of them—will be able to garner those tens of millions of votes by dint of personality. The ‘party of no’ won’t work anymore, not the way demographics are going against the GOP. The only course of action for the GOP is to work with Biden, (I know, only to a degree.) Obama wasn’t particularly effective in this department. Trump didn’t care. It’s time to change that. Biden can do it.

Stimulus

Americans need help. This could get done before Biden is elected, but the president for one may be otherwise occupied and even if he concedes (big if there), he may be in no mood to do anything to make things easier for Biden. (Contrast that with the effort George Bush and his team made before handing off to Obama during the financial crisis of 2008.) McConnell for one said this week, stimulus in the form of a $1,200 per family check is needed, and soon. Democrats started off proposing $3 trillion, but have cut it down to $2 trillion. Biden and McConnell could pull this off together.

National Day of Reconciliation

I know, this is kumbaya, but hear me out. We need to set a day for parades, marches, picnics, whatever—let every town and city decide—where people from both sides come and celebrate America together. Call it a National Day of Freedom or some such, everyone likes that. Proud Boys and Antifa are invited, in fact we really want them to come, as long as they don’t bring guns (I can’t believe I have to say that in America today.)

Liberals and Democrats, since they won the presidency, in particular need to listen to what conservatives are saying and try to understand their grievances. I’m not asking anyone to compromise their values, just hear the other person out. By the way, the left wing of the Democratic Party needs to understand this was not a victory for them. They’re at the table, but not at the head of it. Ours is not a radical country. (This reminds me of an American explaining our two parties to a Brit: “We have the Republican Party in the U.S. which is like your Tory party. And we have the Democratic Party, which is like your Tory Party.”)

Conservatives in the U.S. too need to move off their dime. Want to understand racism in America? Talk to people like New York Knick legend Walt Frazier. I remember being told that he was the best basketball (and football) player in the city of Atlanta his senior year of high school. I met Frazier a few years ago and we had a very nice chat. “Why did you go to Southern Illinois University,” I asked him. “Why not North Carolina or Duke?” Frazier, who’s just 14 years older than I am, looked down at me. “Because they didn’t allow Black athletes to play in the ACC then,” he said. That was a powerful moment for me. Understand that someone like Walt Frazier couldn’t go to the college of his choice. And then extend that to millions of Americans and to every other institution in our country. In your lifetime.

The Federal Reserve

Biden may or may not keep Jay Powell. While Trump nominated him to chair, it’s notable that Powell was originally an Obama appointee.) If he does his message will be simple. “I will never, ever criticize you in public.” Powell’s response will be simple too: “Thank you Mr. President.”

New taxes

No. Not now. Not until we’ve recovered what the economy lost during the pandemic.

Infrastructure

This is not an if, it’s a when. And anytime you make that statement, the best time to act is now. So speaking of the Fed, we have been leaning on this institution far too long and far too much, and yes it is running out of ammunition when it comes to stimulating the economy, which we will still need to do. Also there’s employment. Yes, the jobless rate fell to 6.9% last week, but that’s still high and is likely to stay so. Technology will continue to cause lower skilled workers to lose jobs. (Thousands of cashiers for instance, are going, going gone within 24 months.) Plus, we need new and better bridges, roads, airports, ports, and especially broadband, WiFi, and internet. The U.S. Council of Economic Advisers has calculated that $1 billion of transportation-infrastructure investment supports 13,000 jobs for a year, according to a McKinsey report loaded with great factoids. One hurdle here has been red states versus blue states, who gets the money. Fine, parcel it out. Texas and Florida need capital investment as much as New York and California.

Re-engage allies

There’s much healing that needs to be done, with Europe for instance. And we need to be humble about it. “Most traditional allies, even if they made nice to Trump, thought he was a lunatic,” says Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group. “When our own president is saying our election has been rigged and we should stop the count, we need to calm the hell down with American exceptionalism. People around the world want to come to the U.S. And they want to invest in the U.S. Of course, they do. They're not stupid. But they don't want their political system to look like the United States. Are you kidding me?”

China is the tough one here, as Trump was correct in assessing that the economic relationship between our two countries is out of kilter and not in our favor. We’re never going back to where we were before with China, but we can tone down the military rhetoric for starters, and use multilateral APAC relationships (i.e., include Japan, Korea, Singapore, Australia, etc.) as leverage when dealing with the Chinese. As for Russia, Biden sees them for who they are: Not our friends.

I know what you are thinking right now. Oh, Biden has no mandate. He barely won the election and no one will listen to him. Well, when all is said and done, he will have won probably 24 states and some 75 million votes, more than any other president. So there’s that. But even more, you would be making a mistake to think the arc of history moves in a smooth line.

Less than eight months after George W. Bush was inaugurated, two planes slammed into the World Trade Center killing thousands of Americans. Three days later, on September 14, President Bush visited Ground Zero in lower Manhattan and with the smoldering wreckage of the fallen towers behind him, grabbed a bullhorn and began to speak (you should really watch this.) “I can hear you! The rest of the world hears you! And the people – and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon."" The crowd responded by chanting ""USA! USA!""

No one spoke about how Bush had only won 270 electoral votes and how divided our country had been.

That was in the past.

Combative U.S. FDA panel votes against Biogen Alzheimer's drug,[],"Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc. has been called many things over its 135-year history: Ma Bell, monopoly, media conglomerate. The company, which traces its roots to the patent rights of telephone inventor Alexander Graham Bell, was the dominant phone company for much of the 20th century. So dominant, in fact, that it was broken up in 1982 as part of an agreement with antitrust authorities. But those businesses eventually began to merge, culminating with SBC Communications — one of the so-called Baby Bells — acquiring AT&T in 2005 and taking the name.That wasn’t the end of it. What followed was a streak of deal-making that turned AT&T into a new behemoth spanning television, media and advertising. After a failed attempt to acquire T-Mobile, the company bought satellite-TV provider DirecTV in 2015 for $49 billion, becoming the biggest provider of pay television. It purchased Time Warner in 2018 for $85 billion, making Ma Bell the improbable parent company of HBO, CNN, Warner Bros. and DC Comics. The carrier also made smaller deals, such as the 2018 acquisition of AppNexus, an online ad platform.And once again, AT&T was too big.This time around, it isn’t the government pushing to slim down the company — though the Justice Department did unsuccessfully oppose the Time Warner deal — but its own investors and Chief Executive Officer John Stankey.Stankey took the helm in July, putting him in charge of a company with heavy debt and a media business that was ravaged by the pandemic. AT&T also was shunted to No. 3 in the wireless-phone business this year, following T-Mobile US Inc.’s acquisition of Sprint Corp. The company had just launched HBO Max, an attempt to take on Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co. in streaming, but perhaps the most urgent matter was undoing some of the work of his predecessor.The last CEO, Randall Stephenson, had spent much of his 13-year tenure obsessed with deals. He kept a color-coded roster of potential companies he wanted AT&T to buy, leading to 43 acquisitions. Now Stankey has his own to-do list: things he wants to sell.“It’s going to keep us busy for a little bit of time.”Critics such as activist investor Elliott Management Corp. have urged AT&T to focus on its subscriber services and walk back its go-big-or-go-home M&A strategy by divesting acquisitions, including DirecTV.“When you look at what’s worked or hasn’t worked in telecom, you see that conglomerates and empire building has not been rewarded by the marketplace,” said Todd Lowenstein, chief equity strategist with the Private Bank at Union Bank.Stankey, who has spent his entire 35-year career at AT&T, may be an unlikely person to dismantle AT&T’s acquisition empire. He rode shotgun as a top captain during Stephenson’s decade of agglomeration. The executive had a hand in creating some of the current problems and he calls them out directly: Last month, he acknowledged that pay-TV providers like DirecTV will probably face years of cord cutting before they hit bottom.Now, more than 100 days into the job, he says his plan of attack is to focus on three key growth areas: wireless — particularly 5G — where there’s hope for new consumer and business applications; fiber-optic network connections to accommodate surging data traffic; and HBO Max, the online streaming future of AT&T’s video ambitions.As for new acquisitions, don’t expect much beyond opportunistic purchases, Stankey said in an interview in September. “Right now this management team is focused on getting execution right and moving the distractions elsewhere,” he said. “It’s going to keep us busy for a little bit of time.”Last month, AT&T got $1.1 billion for its stake in Central European Media Enterprises. The company has already sold office buildings and a stake in Disney’s streaming service Hulu. It also got nearly $2 billion from the sale of its Puerto Rico phone business earlier this month.The company is aiming to pay down debt and cut $6 billion in annual costs, partly through slashing thousands of jobs.But AT&T still has plenty of potential businesses to sell or scale back. The question now is how big an asset sale it wants to have — and who may be interested in buying.DirecTVThe biggest priority is DirecTV and AT&T’s other pay-TV operations, which have been hemorrhaging customers. AT&T has been exploring options for DirecTV for more than a year, but finding a buyer for the whole business seems unlikely.A combination with Dish Network Corp., the nation’s other satellite-TV provider, is one scenario. But reducing the industry to a single player would draw antitrust scrutiny, especially since rural customers have few other options. A proposed combination of the two businesses was shot down by the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department in 2002.Instead, AT&T is trying to sell a stake — and possibly control of the business — to outside investors. a move that could take some of the drag off AT&T’s performance. But the ice cube is melting fast: Pay-TV revenue fell by more than $1 billion, or 10%, in the third quarter.Apollo Global Management Inc. has been in discussions about such a transaction. And Bloomberg News reported this week that former Citigroup Inc. rainmaker Michael Klein could do a deal through his blank-check company Churchill Capital Corp. IV. Ideally, an agreement would let AT&T remove DirecTV from its books while maintaining access to some of its cash flow.But a deal is expected to value DirecTV at only about $15 billion when final bids are accepted next month. That's less than a third of the price AT&T paid five years ago.VrioAT&T’s DirecTV Latin America business suffers some of the same problems as the U.S. operations, only with an even more erratic political backdrop. The 2015 acquisition of DirecTV included satellite businesses in South America and the Caribbean — an entity that was renamed Vrio. The unit’s biggest problem was its Venezuela pay-TV business. During the country’s political turmoil, the service was shut down after getting caught between U.S. restrictions and the local government.AT&T tried but failed to spin off part of Vrio in an initial public offering. Then, after reducing the size and price of the offer, AT&T abandoned the move. For the past two years, the falling value of the satellite-TV business has made prospects of unloading the business even dimmer.Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentUnlike some of its businesses, AT&T’s video-game division would be a prized asset for a number of potential buyers. The company has reportedly explored a sale of the operations, which are estimated to be worth $4 billion. But AT&T recently pulled the business off a list of noncore assets that it's willing to part with.The unit, whose video games include titles like Harry Potter: Wizards Unite and Mortal Kombat 11, attracted interest from several major companies. But with the gaming industry booming during the pandemic — and AT&T facing the complications of wanting to retain licensing rights — the company may have decided the division was worth keeping for itself.CrunchyrollThe animation video service was the first step in AT&T’s massive pivot to media six years ago. Crunchyroll was acquired through the company’s newly formed joint venture with the Chernin Group, called Otter Media. The name is derived from the abbreviation OTT, for content delivered via the internet “over the top” of a traditional platform. Since then, just “streaming” has become the more popular term.AT&T bought out the remaining stake in Otter Media from the Chernin Group in 2018. More recently, the telecom giant has had second thoughts. Last week, the Nikkei business daily reported that Sony Corp. was in final talks to acquire the service in a deal worth close to $1 billion.CNNCNN is one of the more controversial businesses that AT&T acquired when it absorbed WarnerMedia in 2018, with the president regularly assailing the cable-news network on social media. It's also been the source of takeover speculation, with Jeff Bezos seen as a potential buyer. But Stankey said in September that CNN was one of the pieces of the WarnerMedia structure that are “more tightly wound together than they were before.” In other words, selling it would seem less likely. XandrAT&T had high hopes for the AppNexus digital advertising unit it acquired for $1.6 billion in 2018. Named in a nod to Alexander Graham Bell, Xandr was going to be an advertising network that all pay-TV providers could use. Ad-industry veteran Brian Lesser was hired to run the operation, and Stephenson told investors that the business would bring in $2 billion in new revenue by using customer data to deliver targeted ads.Those fortunes didn’t materialize. Lesser left, and now it’s up for sale as new WarnerMedia chief Jason Kilar brings in another ad team.Regional Sports NetworksAT&T has four regional sports networks, or RSNs, which include rights to teams such as hockey’s Pittsburgh Penguins, basketball’s Houston Rockets and baseball’s Seattle Mariners.Though live sports are still the closest thing to must-see TV these days, owning RSNs has increasingly become a headache. Sports leagues have sought ever-increasing sums for rights to their games, and subscribers aren’t as reliable as they once were. Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. just wrote down its RSNs by $4.23 billion, an admission that it overpaid for the cable channels, which it only acquired last year.Looking for cash to pay down debts, AT&T had hoped to sell its RSNs and cash in on their $1 billion in estimated value. The company sought bids last year, but a buyer didn’t materialize. This year, with sports still trying to bounce back from Covid-19, a sale seems even less likely.Digital LifeIn a bold attempt to take on home-security giant ADT Inc., AT&T launched its own “smart home” security and monitoring venture in 2013. While the effort was intended to explore opportunities beyond its wireless service, the timing and model may have been wrong. Homeowners were already moving away from expensive security services and buying do-it-yourself systems or products like Ring from Amazon.com Inc. or Nest from Alphabet Inc. Four years into the venture, AT&T started looking for ways to get out.AT&T MexicoStephenson crossed borders and ended a decadeslong friendship with his onetime mentor Carlos Slim by becoming a direct competitor for mobile customers in Mexico. AT&T bought wireless carrier Grupo Iusacell SA for $2.5 billion in 2015 and expanded the service to cover most of Mexico by 2018. But Covid-19, foreign-exchange rates and the dominance of rival America Movil in Mexico has kept the investment unprofitable and difficult to justify.“It’s going to keep us busy for a little bit of time.”So what does Stankey do now? Holding out to get top dollar for some of these assets might not be the right approach, said Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen.Stankey just needs to “rip the Band-Aid off and move on,” Synesael said. In other words, take what he can get. “I think it has become obvious to him that he needs to do it. And the sooner he does it the better,” Synesael said. “He doesn’t want to spend his entire CEO tenure undoing what he and Randall did in the past. Get it done now so he can concentrate on other initiatives.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

"China October exports surge, imports rise amid global recovery",[],"Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc. has been called many things over its 135-year history: Ma Bell, monopoly, media conglomerate. The company, which traces its roots to the patent rights of telephone inventor Alexander Graham Bell, was the dominant phone company for much of the 20th century. So dominant, in fact, that it was broken up in 1982 as part of an agreement with antitrust authorities. But those businesses eventually began to merge, culminating with SBC Communications — one of the so-called Baby Bells — acquiring AT&T in 2005 and taking the name.That wasn’t the end of it. What followed was a streak of deal-making that turned AT&T into a new behemoth spanning television, media and advertising. After a failed attempt to acquire T-Mobile, the company bought satellite-TV provider DirecTV in 2015 for $49 billion, becoming the biggest provider of pay television. It purchased Time Warner in 2018 for $85 billion, making Ma Bell the improbable parent company of HBO, CNN, Warner Bros. and DC Comics. The carrier also made smaller deals, such as the 2018 acquisition of AppNexus, an online ad platform.And once again, AT&T was too big.This time around, it isn’t the government pushing to slim down the company — though the Justice Department did unsuccessfully oppose the Time Warner deal — but its own investors and Chief Executive Officer John Stankey.Stankey took the helm in July, putting him in charge of a company with heavy debt and a media business that was ravaged by the pandemic. AT&T also was shunted to No. 3 in the wireless-phone business this year, following T-Mobile US Inc.’s acquisition of Sprint Corp. The company had just launched HBO Max, an attempt to take on Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co. in streaming, but perhaps the most urgent matter was undoing some of the work of his predecessor.The last CEO, Randall Stephenson, had spent much of his 13-year tenure obsessed with deals. He kept a color-coded roster of potential companies he wanted AT&T to buy, leading to 43 acquisitions. Now Stankey has his own to-do list: things he wants to sell.“It’s going to keep us busy for a little bit of time.”Critics such as activist investor Elliott Management Corp. have urged AT&T to focus on its subscriber services and walk back its go-big-or-go-home M&A strategy by divesting acquisitions, including DirecTV.“When you look at what’s worked or hasn’t worked in telecom, you see that conglomerates and empire building has not been rewarded by the marketplace,” said Todd Lowenstein, chief equity strategist with the Private Bank at Union Bank.Stankey, who has spent his entire 35-year career at AT&T, may be an unlikely person to dismantle AT&T’s acquisition empire. He rode shotgun as a top captain during Stephenson’s decade of agglomeration. The executive had a hand in creating some of the current problems and he calls them out directly: Last month, he acknowledged that pay-TV providers like DirecTV will probably face years of cord cutting before they hit bottom.Now, more than 100 days into the job, he says his plan of attack is to focus on three key growth areas: wireless — particularly 5G — where there’s hope for new consumer and business applications; fiber-optic network connections to accommodate surging data traffic; and HBO Max, the online streaming future of AT&T’s video ambitions.As for new acquisitions, don’t expect much beyond opportunistic purchases, Stankey said in an interview in September. “Right now this management team is focused on getting execution right and moving the distractions elsewhere,” he said. “It’s going to keep us busy for a little bit of time.”Last month, AT&T got $1.1 billion for its stake in Central European Media Enterprises. The company has already sold office buildings and a stake in Disney’s streaming service Hulu. It also got nearly $2 billion from the sale of its Puerto Rico phone business earlier this month.The company is aiming to pay down debt and cut $6 billion in annual costs, partly through slashing thousands of jobs.But AT&T still has plenty of potential businesses to sell or scale back. The question now is how big an asset sale it wants to have — and who may be interested in buying.DirecTVThe biggest priority is DirecTV and AT&T’s other pay-TV operations, which have been hemorrhaging customers. AT&T has been exploring options for DirecTV for more than a year, but finding a buyer for the whole business seems unlikely.A combination with Dish Network Corp., the nation’s other satellite-TV provider, is one scenario. But reducing the industry to a single player would draw antitrust scrutiny, especially since rural customers have few other options. A proposed combination of the two businesses was shot down by the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department in 2002.Instead, AT&T is trying to sell a stake — and possibly control of the business — to outside investors. a move that could take some of the drag off AT&T’s performance. But the ice cube is melting fast: Pay-TV revenue fell by more than $1 billion, or 10%, in the third quarter.Apollo Global Management Inc. has been in discussions about such a transaction. And Bloomberg News reported this week that former Citigroup Inc. rainmaker Michael Klein could do a deal through his blank-check company Churchill Capital Corp. IV. Ideally, an agreement would let AT&T remove DirecTV from its books while maintaining access to some of its cash flow.But a deal is expected to value DirecTV at only about $15 billion when final bids are accepted next month. That's less than a third of the price AT&T paid five years ago.VrioAT&T’s DirecTV Latin America business suffers some of the same problems as the U.S. operations, only with an even more erratic political backdrop. The 2015 acquisition of DirecTV included satellite businesses in South America and the Caribbean — an entity that was renamed Vrio. The unit’s biggest problem was its Venezuela pay-TV business. During the country’s political turmoil, the service was shut down after getting caught between U.S. restrictions and the local government.AT&T tried but failed to spin off part of Vrio in an initial public offering. Then, after reducing the size and price of the offer, AT&T abandoned the move.

This week in Trumponomics: The end of Trumponomics,[],"Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc. has been called many things over its 135-year history: Ma Bell, monopoly, media conglomerate. The company, which traces its roots to the patent rights of telephone inventor Alexander Graham Bell, was the dominant phone company for much of the 20th century. So dominant, in fact, that it was broken up in 1982 as part of an agreement with antitrust authorities. But those businesses eventually began to merge, culminating with SBC Communications — one of the so-called Baby Bells — acquiring AT&T in 2005 and taking the name.That wasn’t the end of it. What followed was a streak of deal-making that turned AT&T into a new behemoth spanning television, media and advertising. After a failed attempt to acquire T-Mobile, the company bought satellite-TV provider DirecTV in 2015 for $49 billion, becoming the biggest provider of pay television. It purchased Time Warner in 2018 for $85 billion, making Ma Bell the improbable parent company of HBO, CNN, Warner Bros. and DC Comics. The carrier also made smaller deals, such as the 2018 acquisition of AppNexus, an online ad platform.And once again, AT&T was too big.This time around, it isn’t the government pushing to slim down the company — though the Justice Department did unsuccessfully oppose the Time Warner deal — but its own investors and Chief Executive Officer John Stankey.Stankey took the helm in July, putting him in charge of a company with heavy debt and a media business that was ravaged by the pandemic. AT&T also was shunted to No. 3 in the wireless-phone business this year, following T-Mobile US Inc.’s acquisition of Sprint Corp. The company had just launched HBO Max, an attempt to take on Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co. in streaming, but perhaps the most urgent matter was undoing some of the work of his predecessor.The last CEO, Randall Stephenson, had spent much of his 13-year tenure obsessed with deals. He kept a color-coded roster of potential companies he wanted AT&T to buy, leading to 43 acquisitions. Now Stankey has his own to-do list: things he wants to sell.“It’s going to keep us busy for a little bit of time.”Critics such as activist investor Elliott Management Corp. have urged AT&T to focus on its subscriber services and walk back its go-big-or-go-home M&A strategy by divesting acquisitions, including DirecTV.“When you look at what’s worked or hasn’t worked in telecom, you see that conglomerates and empire building has not been rewarded by the marketplace,” said Todd Lowenstein, chief equity strategist with the Private Bank at Union Bank.Stankey, who has spent his entire 35-year career at AT&T, may be an unlikely person to dismantle AT&T’s acquisition empire. He rode shotgun as a top captain during Stephenson’s decade of agglomeration. The executive had a hand in creating some of the current problems and he calls them out directly: Last month, he acknowledged that pay-TV providers like DirecTV will probably face years of cord cutting before they hit bottom.Now, more than 100 days into the job, he says his plan of attack is to focus on three key growth areas: wireless — particularly 5G — where there’s hope for new consumer and business applications; fiber-optic network connections to accommodate surging data traffic; and HBO Max, the online streaming future of AT&T’s video ambitions.As for new acquisitions, don’t expect much beyond opportunistic purchases, Stankey said in an interview in September. “Right now this management team is focused on getting execution right and moving the distractions elsewhere,” he said. “It’s going to keep us busy for a little bit of time.”Last month, AT&T got $1.1 billion for its stake in Central European Media Enterprises. The company has already sold office buildings and a stake in Disney’s streaming service Hulu. It also got nearly $2 billion from the sale of its Puerto Rico phone business earlier this month.The company is aiming to pay down debt and cut $6 billion in annual costs, partly through slashing thousands of jobs.But AT&T still has plenty of potential businesses to sell or scale back. The question now is how big an asset sale it wants to have — and who may be interested in buying.DirecTVThe biggest priority is DirecTV and AT&T’s other pay-TV operations, which have been hemorrhaging customers. AT&T has been exploring options for DirecTV for more than a year, but finding a buyer for the whole business seems unlikely.A combination with Dish Network Corp., the nation’s other satellite-TV provider, is one scenario. But reducing the industry to a single player would draw antitrust scrutiny, especially since rural customers have few other options. A proposed combination of the two businesses was shot down by the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department in 2002.Instead, AT&T is trying to sell a stake — and possibly control of the business — to outside investors. a move that could take some of the drag off AT&T’s performance. But the ice cube is melting fast: Pay-TV revenue fell by more than $1 billion, or 10%, in the third quarter.Apollo Global Management Inc. has been in discussions about such a transaction. And Bloomberg News reported this week that former Citigroup Inc. rainmaker Michael Klein could do a deal through his blank-check company Churchill Capital Corp. IV. Ideally, an agreement would let AT&T remove DirecTV from its books while maintaining access to some of its cash flow.But a deal is expected to value DirecTV at only about $15 billion when final bids are accepted next month. That's less than a third of the price AT&T paid five years ago.VrioAT&T’s DirecTV Latin America business suffers some of the same problems as the U.S. operations, only with an even more erratic political backdrop. The 2015 acquisition of DirecTV included satellite businesses in South America and the Caribbean — an entity that was renamed Vrio. The unit’s biggest problem was its Venezuela pay-TV business. During the country’s political turmoil, the service was shut down after getting caught between U.S. restrictions and the local government.AT&T tried but failed to spin off part of Vrio in an initial public offering. Then, after reducing the size and price of the offer, AT&T abandoned the move. For the past two years, the falling value of the satellite-TV business has made prospects of unloading the business even dimmer.Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentUnlike some of its businesses, AT&T’s video-game division would be a prized asset for a number of potential buyers. The company has reportedly explored a sale of the operations, which are estimated to be worth $4 billion. But AT&T recently pulled the business off a list of noncore assets that it's willing to part with.The unit, whose video games include titles like Harry Potter: Wizards Unite and Mortal Kombat 11, attracted interest from several major companies.

Oil Stocks – Buying Opportunity of a Lifetime,[],"Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc. has been called many things over its 135-year history: Ma Bell, monopoly, media conglomerate. The company, which traces its roots to the patent rights of telephone inventor Alexander Graham Bell, was the dominant phone company for much of the 20th century. So dominant, in fact, that it was broken up in 1982 as part of an agreement with antitrust authorities. But those businesses eventually began to merge, culminating with SBC Communications — one of the so-called Baby Bells — acquiring AT&T in 2005 and taking the name.That wasn’t the end of it. What followed was a streak of deal-making that turned AT&T into a new behemoth spanning television, media and advertising. After a failed attempt to acquire T-Mobile, the company bought satellite-TV provider DirecTV in 2015 for $49 billion, becoming the biggest provider of pay television. It purchased Time Warner in 2018 for $85 billion, making Ma Bell the improbable parent company of HBO, CNN, Warner Bros. and DC Comics. The carrier also made smaller deals, such as the 2018 acquisition of AppNexus, an online ad platform.And once again, AT&T was too big.This time around, it isn’t the government pushing to slim down the company — though the Justice Department did unsuccessfully oppose the Time Warner deal — but its own investors and Chief Executive Officer John Stankey.Stankey took the helm in July, putting him in charge of a company with heavy debt and a media business that was ravaged by the pandemic. AT&T also was shunted to No. 3 in the wireless-phone business this year, following T-Mobile US Inc.’s acquisition of Sprint Corp. The company had just launched HBO Max, an attempt to take on Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co. in streaming, but perhaps the most urgent matter was undoing some of the work of his predecessor.The last CEO, Randall Stephenson, had spent much of his 13-year tenure obsessed with deals. He kept a color-coded roster of potential companies he wanted AT&T to buy, leading to 43 acquisitions. Now Stankey has his own to-do list: things he wants to sell.“It’s going to keep us busy for a little bit of time.”Critics such as activist investor Elliott Management Corp. have urged AT&T to focus on its subscriber services and walk back its go-big-or-go-home M&A strategy by divesting acquisitions, including DirecTV.“When you look at what’s worked or hasn’t worked in telecom, you see that conglomerates and empire building has not been rewarded by the marketplace,” said Todd Lowenstein, chief equity strategist with the Private Bank at Union Bank.Stankey, who has spent his entire 35-year career at AT&T, may be an unlikely person to dismantle AT&T’s acquisition empire. He rode shotgun as a top captain during Stephenson’s decade of agglomeration. The executive had a hand in creating some of the current problems and he calls them out directly: Last month, he acknowledged that pay-TV providers like DirecTV will probably face years of cord cutting before they hit bottom.Now, more than 100 days into the job, he says his plan of attack is to focus on three key growth areas: wireless — particularly 5G — where there’s hope for new consumer and business applications; fiber-optic network connections to accommodate surging data traffic; and HBO Max, the online streaming future of AT&T’s video ambitions.As for new acquisitions, don’t expect much beyond opportunistic purchases, Stankey said in an interview in September. “Right now this management team is focused on getting execution right and moving the distractions elsewhere,” he said. “It’s going to keep us busy for a little bit of time.”Last month, AT&T got $1.1 billion for its stake in Central European Media Enterprises. The company has already sold office buildings and a stake in Disney’s streaming service Hulu. It also got nearly $2 billion from the sale of its Puerto Rico phone business earlier this month.The company is aiming to pay down debt and cut $6 billion in annual costs, partly through slashing thousands of jobs.But AT&T still has plenty of potential businesses to sell or scale back. The question now is how big an asset sale it wants to have — and who may be interested in buying.DirecTVThe biggest priority is DirecTV and AT&T’s other pay-TV operations, which have been hemorrhaging customers. AT&T has been exploring options for DirecTV for more than a year, but finding a buyer for the whole business seems unlikely.A combination with Dish Network Corp., the nation’s other satellite-TV provider, is one scenario. But reducing the industry to a single player would draw antitrust scrutiny, especially since rural customers have few other options. A proposed combination of the two businesses was shot down by the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department in 2002.Instead, AT&T is trying to sell a stake — and possibly control of the business — to outside investors. a move that could take some of the drag off AT&T’s performance. But the ice cube is melting fast: Pay-TV revenue fell by more than $1 billion, or 10%, in the third quarter.Apollo Global Management Inc. has been in discussions about such a transaction. And Bloomberg News reported this week that former Citigroup Inc. rainmaker Michael Klein could do a deal through his blank-check company Churchill Capital Corp. IV. Ideally, an agreement would let AT&T remove DirecTV from its books while maintaining access to some of its cash flow.But a deal is expected to value DirecTV at only about $15 billion when final bids are accepted next month. That's less than a third of the price AT&T paid five years ago.VrioAT&T’s DirecTV Latin America business suffers some of the same problems as the U.S. operations, only with an even more erratic political backdrop. The 2015 acquisition of DirecTV included satellite businesses in South America and the Caribbean — an entity that was renamed Vrio. The unit’s biggest problem was its Venezuela pay-TV business. During the country’s political turmoil, the service was shut down after getting caught between U.S. restrictions and the local government.AT&T tried but failed to spin off part of Vrio in an initial public offering. Then, after reducing the size and price of the offer, AT&T abandoned the move. For the past two years, the falling value of the satellite-TV business has made prospects of unloading the business even dimmer.Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentUnlike some of its businesses, AT&T’s video-game division would be a prized asset for a number of potential buyers. The company has reportedly explored a sale of the operations, which are estimated to be worth $4 billion. But AT&T recently pulled the business off a list of noncore assets that it's willing to part with.The unit, whose video games include titles like Harry Potter: Wizards Unite and Mortal Kombat 11, attracted interest from several major companies. But with the gaming industry booming during the pandemic — and AT&T facing the complications of wanting to retain licensing rights — the company may have decided the division was worth keeping for itself.CrunchyrollThe animation video service was the first step in AT&T’s massive pivot to media six years ago.

Berkshire Buys Back Another $9 Billion of Stock in Record Year,[],"Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc. has been called many things over its 135-year history: Ma Bell, monopoly, media conglomerate. The company, which traces its roots to the patent rights of telephone inventor Alexander Graham Bell, was the dominant phone company for much of the 20th century. So dominant, in fact, that it was broken up in 1982 as part of an agreement with antitrust authorities. But those businesses eventually began to merge, culminating with SBC Communications — one of the so-called Baby Bells — acquiring AT&T in 2005 and taking the name.That wasn’t the end of it. What followed was a streak of deal-making that turned AT&T into a new behemoth spanning television, media and advertising. After a failed attempt to acquire T-Mobile, the company bought satellite-TV provider DirecTV in 2015 for $49 billion, becoming the biggest provider of pay television. It purchased Time Warner in 2018 for $85 billion, making Ma Bell the improbable parent company of HBO, CNN, Warner Bros. and DC Comics. The carrier also made smaller deals, such as the 2018 acquisition of AppNexus, an online ad platform.And once again, AT&T was too big.This time around, it isn’t the government pushing to slim down the company — though the Justice Department did unsuccessfully oppose the Time Warner deal — but its own investors and Chief Executive Officer John Stankey.Stankey took the helm in July, putting him in charge of a company with heavy debt and a media business that was ravaged by the pandemic. AT&T also was shunted to No. 3 in the wireless-phone business this year, following T-Mobile US Inc.’s acquisition of Sprint Corp. The company had just launched HBO Max, an attempt to take on Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co. in streaming, but perhaps the most urgent matter was undoing some of the work of his predecessor.The last CEO, Randall Stephenson, had spent much of his 13-year tenure obsessed with deals. He kept a color-coded roster of potential companies he wanted AT&T to buy, leading to 43 acquisitions. Now Stankey has his own to-do list: things he wants to sell.“It’s going to keep us busy for a little bit of time.”Critics such as activist investor Elliott Management Corp. have urged AT&T to focus on its subscriber services and walk back its go-big-or-go-home M&A strategy by divesting acquisitions, including DirecTV.“When you look at what’s worked or hasn’t worked in telecom, you see that conglomerates and empire building has not been rewarded by the marketplace,” said Todd Lowenstein, chief equity strategist with the Private Bank at Union Bank.Stankey, who has spent his entire 35-year career at AT&T, may be an unlikely person to dismantle AT&T’s acquisition empire. He rode shotgun as a top captain during Stephenson’s decade of agglomeration. The executive had a hand in creating some of the current problems and he calls them out directly: Last month, he acknowledged that pay-TV providers like DirecTV will probably face years of cord cutting before they hit bottom.Now, more than 100 days into the job, he says his plan of attack is to focus on three key growth areas: wireless — particularly 5G — where there’s hope for new consumer and business applications; fiber-optic network connections to accommodate surging data traffic; and HBO Max, the online streaming future of AT&T’s video ambitions.As for new acquisitions, don’t expect much beyond opportunistic purchases, Stankey said in an interview in September. “Right now this management team is focused on getting execution right and moving the distractions elsewhere,” he said. “It’s going to keep us busy for a little bit of time.”Last month, AT&T got $1.1 billion for its stake in Central European Media Enterprises. The company has already sold office buildings and a stake in Disney’s streaming service Hulu. It also got nearly $2 billion from the sale of its Puerto Rico phone business earlier this month.The company is aiming to pay down debt and cut $6 billion in annual costs, partly through slashing thousands of jobs.But AT&T still has plenty of potential businesses to sell or scale back. The question now is how big an asset sale it wants to have — and who may be interested in buying.DirecTVThe biggest priority is DirecTV and AT&T’s other pay-TV operations, which have been hemorrhaging customers. AT&T has been exploring options for DirecTV for more than a year, but finding a buyer for the whole business seems unlikely.A combination with Dish Network Corp., the nation’s other satellite-TV provider, is one scenario. But reducing the industry to a single player would draw antitrust scrutiny, especially since rural customers have few other options. A proposed combination of the two businesses was shot down by the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department in 2002.Instead, AT&T is trying to sell a stake — and possibly control of the business — to outside investors. a move that could take some of the drag off AT&T’s performance. But the ice cube is melting fast: Pay-TV revenue fell by more than $1 billion, or 10%, in the third quarter.Apollo Global Management Inc. has been in discussions about such a transaction. And Bloomberg News reported this week that former Citigroup Inc. rainmaker Michael Klein could do a deal through his blank-check company Churchill Capital Corp. IV. Ideally, an agreement would let AT&T remove DirecTV from its books while maintaining access to some of its cash flow.But a deal is expected to value DirecTV at only about $15 billion when final bids are accepted next month. That's less than a third of the price AT&T paid five years ago.VrioAT&T’s DirecTV Latin America business suffers some of the same problems as the U.S. operations, only with an even more erratic political backdrop. The 2015 acquisition of DirecTV included satellite businesses in South America and the Caribbean — an entity that was renamed Vrio. The unit’s biggest problem was its Venezuela pay-TV business. During the country’s political turmoil, the service was shut down after getting caught between U.S. restrictions and the local government.AT&T tried but failed to spin off part of Vrio in an initial public offering. Then, after reducing the size and price of the offer, AT&T abandoned the move. For the past two years, the falling value of the satellite-TV business has made prospects of unloading the business even dimmer.Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentUnlike some of its businesses, AT&T’s video-game division would be a prized asset for a number of potential buyers. The company has reportedly explored a sale of the operations, which are estimated to be worth $4 billion. But AT&T recently pulled the business off a list of noncore assets that it's willing to part with.The unit, whose video games include titles like Harry Potter: Wizards Unite and Mortal Kombat 11, attracted interest from several major companies. But with the gaming industry booming during the pandemic — and AT&T facing the complications of wanting to retain licensing rights — the company may have decided the division was worth keeping for itself.CrunchyrollThe animation video service was the first step in AT&T’s massive pivot to media six years ago. Crunchyroll was acquired through the company’s newly formed joint venture with the Chernin Group, called Otter Media. The name is derived from the abbreviation OTT, for content delivered via the internet “over the top” of a traditional platform. Since then, just “streaming” has become the more popular term.AT&T bought out the remaining stake in Otter Media from the Chernin Group in 2018.

XandrAT&T had high hopes for the AppNexus digital advertising unit it acquired for $1.6 billion in 2018. Named in a nod to Alexander Graham Bell, Xandr was going to be an advertising network that all pay-TV providers could use. Ad-industry veteran Brian Lesser was hired to run the operation, and Stephenson told investors that the business would bring in $2 billion in new revenue by using customer data to deliver targeted ads.Those fortunes didn’t materialize. Lesser left, and now it’s up for sale as new WarnerMedia chief Jason Kilar brings in another ad team.Regional Sports NetworksAT&T has four regional sports networks, or RSNs, which include rights to teams such as hockey’s Pittsburgh Penguins, basketball’s Houston Rockets and baseball’s Seattle Mariners.Though live sports are still the closest thing to must-see TV these days, owning RSNs has increasingly become a headache. Sports leagues have sought ever-increasing sums for rights to their games, and subscribers aren’t as reliable as they once were. Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. just wrote down its RSNs by $4.23 billion, an admission that it overpaid for the cable channels, which it only acquired last year.Looking for cash to pay down debts, AT&T had hoped to sell its RSNs and cash in on their $1 billion in estimated value. The company sought bids last year, but a buyer didn’t materialize. This year, with sports still trying to bounce back from Covid-19, a sale seems even less likely.Digital LifeIn a bold attempt to take on home-security giant ADT Inc., AT&T launched its own “smart home” security and monitoring venture in 2013. While the effort was intended to explore opportunities beyond its wireless service, the timing and model may have been wrong. Homeowners were already moving away from expensive security services and buying do-it-yourself systems or products like Ring from Amazon.com Inc. or Nest from Alphabet Inc. Four years into the venture, AT&T started looking for ways to get out.AT&T MexicoStephenson crossed borders and ended a decadeslong friendship with his onetime mentor Carlos Slim by becoming a direct competitor for mobile customers in Mexico. AT&T bought wireless carrier Grupo Iusacell SA for $2.5 billion in 2015 and expanded the service to cover most of Mexico by 2018. But Covid-19, foreign-exchange rates and the dominance of rival America Movil in Mexico has kept the investment unprofitable and difficult to justify.“It’s going to keep us busy for a little bit of time.”So what does Stankey do now? Holding out to get top dollar for some of these assets might not be the right approach, said Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen.Stankey just needs to “rip the Band-Aid off and move on,” Synesael said. In other words, take what he can get. “I think it has become obvious to him that he needs to do it. And the sooner he does it the better,” Synesael said. “He doesn’t want to spend his entire CEO tenure undoing what he and Randall did in the past. Get it done now so he can concentrate on other initiatives.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

"The NFL enhanced its Rooney Rule. But will league enforce it, particularly in case of the Washington Football Team?","['N. Jeremi Duru', 'Yahoo Sports Contributor']","In late May, the NFL strengthened and expanded the Rooney Rule, its requirement that any club looking for a head coach or general manager must interview at least one person of color. The league did so on the heels of a precipitous drop in the number of people of color holding those positions and vigorous public debate as to whether the league gave a hoot about the stark disproportionality between its player population (overwhelmingly of color), and its head coach and front-office ranks (overwhelmingly white).

Under new regulations, clubs must interview at least two candidates of color for head coach vacancies and at least one candidate of color for offensive, defensive and special teams coordinator vacancies. In addition, the rule applies to senior front-office positions with respect to race and gender.

Just two months after the league expanded the rule, the Washington Football Team seemingly flouted it. The team hired two white executives — Terry Bateman and Julie Donaldson — within two days in mid-July and, by all indications, interviewed nobody of color before doing so.

It is possible that Donaldson’s hire as senior vice president of media passes muster, as the league has been unclear whether the revamped rule requires that each interview slate include racial and gender diversity, but there is not a smidge of public evidence that Bateman’s hire as chief marketing officer passes muster.

In regard to Bateman, the NFL told The Washington Post it was “reviewing the matter with the team to understand the facts.” That was in late July.

The league has stood conspicuously silent since, failing to enforce its enhanced rule or offer substantive public comment on the matter. This silence threatens to erode the NFL community of color’s confidence in the rule as well as undermine the rule itself. The NFL must act, and it must act now. And a glance back at its own history is all the guidance it needs.

Detroit Lions once felt sting of Rooney Rule violation

In early 2003, the league faced a strikingly similar situation. Just months after all 32 NFL club owners agreed to enact the Rooney Rule, the Detroit Lions hired a head coach in contravention of the rule. The Lions wanted Steve Mariucci, and they hired him without interviewing a person of color.

Commissioner Paul Tagliabue had a simple choice: ignore the violation and render the fledgling rule meaningless or enforce it. Tagliabue enforced the rule, fining then Lions general manager Matt Millen $200,000. The league promised a $500,000 fine to the next club that violated the rule and warned franchises against sham processes in which a candidate of color’s interview was a shell of what white candidates received.

Tagliabue’s decision gave the rule teeth, and with the rule firmly in place, the ranks of Black head coaches began to increase (as did the ranks of Black general managers when the Rooney Rule was expanded to that position a few years later). Indeed, as of 2016, the number of general managers of color in the league stood at seven and in 2017 the number of head coaches of color in the league was at eight, both high-water marks.

LeBron James doesn't seem happy about the NBA's incredibly short offseason,['Ryan Young'],"The 2020-21 NBA season will officially kick off on Dec. 22, and LeBron James doesn’t seem too happy about it.

The start date, which was approved by the National Basketball Players Association on Thursday, will officially mean that the NBA offseason will last just 71 days — the shortest offseason both in league history and in the history of the four major men’s professional sports in the United States.

James, who just finished leading the Los Angeles Lakers to a title last month, shared his reaction to the news on Instagram on Friday afternoon.

NBPA approves plan for 72-game season starting Dec. 22

The NBPA tentatively approved the league’s play for a 72-game season that will start on Dec. 22 and end before the Tokyo Olympics kick off in mid-July.

The plan, per ESPN, will leave just 71 days between the Lakers’ NBA Finals win and opening day. It will leave just 51 days between that and the start of training camp. That’s less than half the traditional offseason, and nearly half of the previous shortest league offseason — which came in at 127 days.

Players had initially criticized the move to start the season before 2021. James’ teammate Danny Green even said he thinks that veterans around the league — James included — wouldn’t even show up if the season started before January.

James even joked in a conversation with Maverick Carter and former President Barack Obama on “The Shop” last week that he’d be “cherry-picking the whole first half of the season.”

A pre-Christmas start, however, reportedly will save the league anywhere from $500 million to $1 billion in revenue. That, and the prospect of returning to a regularly-scheduled 82-game season for 2021-22, both made starting sooner more appealing for the league.

Though James clearly isn’t thrilled about suiting back up so soon, the league is moving forward.

NFL draft: Best Pac-12 prospects who are playing this fall,['Eric Edholm'],"Even with numerous, hefty opt outs in the Pac-12 — including Oregon offensive tackle Penei Sewell, a potential top-five pick — the conference’s entrance to the 2020 college football season means that we have a new pool of 2021 NFL draft talent to discuss.

Keeping track of who has opted out and who has opted back in has been tedious business. But we’re trying our best to stay on top of all the wild movement the past three months. (If you think we left someone off this list, give a heads-up.)

There are several players who are back in the fold and can benefit from more tape on their dossiers. As many as six could factor into the top-50 discussion by year’s end.

For now, here are the 20 Pac-12 prospects who are expected to suit up this fall.

USC's Alijah Vera-Tucker is moving to left tackle this fall and could vie for a spot in Round 1 of the 2021 NFL draft. (Photo by Kevin Abele/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)

As a first-time, full-time starter last season, Vera-Tucker was a terrific performer at left guard for the Trojans — so much so that he initially opted out of the 2020 season and begin his prep for the draft.

Well, AVT is back for this season, and at a new position. Vera-Tucker is moving to left tackle, which was the plan before his initial opt out. He could boost his stock significantly by playing at a high level at more of a premium position.

The 6-foot-4, 315-pound redshirt junior has great feet, terrific balance and flexibility. He needs to finish blocks and use his hands better, but Vera-Tucker profiles as a Day 2 pick at minimum, and he could work his way into the Round 1 discussion the way Austin Jackson did for USC a year ago.

The young brother of the Green Bay Packers’ Equanimeous St. Brown (2018 sixth-round pick), the Trojans wideout took a step forward last year after a promising freshman season in 2018.

St. Brown has top-50 talent and could enter the late Round 1 picture, catching more passes from possible future top-10 pick QB Kedon Slovis.

St. Brown has mostly worked in the slot in his two years at USC, flashing some great hands, yards-after-the-catch skills and tremendous body control. We expect him to stack some big performances this season, starting with the season opener against Arizona State on Saturday.

Big comp here, but St. Brown gives Chris Godwin vibes. He faces questions only about whether his physique is developed enough and whether he can play as effectively outside against press coverage.

The Huskies’ slot corner is the latest NFL prospect to be developed at the school, under the watchful eye of head coach Jimmy Lake. Molden is the leader of a very talented secondary, and he was named first team all-conference last year.

He’s listed at 5-foot-10 and 190 pounds, although scouts believe he’ll end up a bit shy of those marks come weigh-in time. That size is concerning because it could pigeonhole him into a slot-only role in the NFL, even if he has dabbled outside, at safety and as a blitzer for Washington.

Molden’s liquidy hips and change-of-direction skills are borderline elite, and his playmaking knack (four picks, 10 passes defended a year ago) are hard to overlook. If your NFL team needs a Bryce Callahan-type of slot defender, Molden might be your man.

He’s in the top-75 picture with a chance to crack the top 50.

Story continues

A massive man and impressive pass blocker, the smooth-moving Lucas is a redshirt junior. At times, he looks like a potential first-round prospect; other times ... he has some work to do.

At early 6-foot-7 and 324 pounds, Lucas looks like a central-casting tackle. His footwork is impressive in pass protection and he hits his landmarks well on the move. When it comes to burrowing down and moving people in the run game, it’s something we have not seen him do because of the Mike Leach system in which Lucas played the past two years.

Now in a new offense, Lucas has a shot to prove his standing as a more well-rounded tackle. There’s no doubt he possesses NFL skills with starting potential.

With 38 consecutive starts entering this weekend, Bynum has a ton of experience — and tape. He has only five interceptions in that time and hasn’t displayed tremendous ball skills. But Bynum’s tackling ability, solid length (6-foot with nearly 32-inch arms) and fluid coverage skills make him a nice outside CB prospect.

He’s a top-100 prospect with a high floor, even if his testing numbers might not be in the top tier. And for all his experience, Bynum comes into this season strangely underrated. He also could be tried as a free safety at the next level.

Rashed broke out last season as one of the most improved players in the nation in 2019. He had 14 sacks, 22.5 tackles for loss and two forced fumbles. Down the stretch in conference play, he had some monster pressure games — even if some of them came against lesser pass-blocking teams.

View photos Oregon State pass rusher Hamilcar Rashed Jr. had a breakout season in 2019. (Photo by Chris Coduto/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) More

It’s going to be hard to make that kind of per-game production this season, but Rashed has a chance to rise quickly if he does. He has long arms, great burst off the line and plays with whistle-to-whistle intensity.

Can he be an effective NFL rusher at 6-3 and 248 pounds? Can he add polish to his pass-rush technique? Those are the biggest questions.

Vaughns was a nice running mate to St. Brown and Michael Pittman Jr. last season. He figures to have a slightly bigger role as a senior.

There might not be anything eye-popping with him as a prospect, but Vaughs offers a reliability factor with his good length (6-foot-2 with nearly 34-inch arms), inside-outside positional versatility and consistent production.

Outside of a six-snap performance against Utah (when he suffered an ankle injury) last season, Vaughns caught four or more passes in every game in 2019 and dropped only four passes on 96 targets after the opener. Does he lack blazing speed? Shifty quickness? Yes and yes.

But he’d make a nice complementary receiver in the NFL, sort of in the Josh Reynolds mold.

Odighizuwa is a fascinating study with a tricky projection. West Coast scouts have estimated that Odighizuwa stands a little less than 6-feet-2 and weighs closer to 270 pounds than the 279 he’s listed at.

Those are unusual dimensions for a traditional NFL rush end and pretty small to be kicked inside full time, so we could see him struggle to find a consistent home on defense, similar to the 49ers’ Solomon Thomas. Odighizuwa often plays head up over the offensive tackle in the Bruins’ three-man front but might lack the length to be a 5-technique in the NFL.

Odighizuwa isn’t likely to be as highly thought of coming into next year’s draft as Thomas, the third overall pick in 2017. But his good football DNA (the brother of former Giants third-rounder Owa Odighizuwa), quick-penetration ability and good leverage make him a top-100 candidate.

Darby might not land in Round 1 the way his former teammates, N’Keal Harry and Brandon Aiyuk, did. There’s still NFL receiver talent in the overlooked Darby, and he should raise his stock with a big final season like the other Sun Devils.

View photos Arizona State WR Frank Darby could be the Sun Devils' next star at the position. (Photo by Kevin Abele/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) More

Darby’s frame is on the lean side, and we’d like to see him harness more of his raw strength and explosion. With terrific quickness, ball-tracking ability and outstanding feet, the 6-foot, 194-pound Darby should be a big weapon for QB Jayden Daniels

In a four-game span last November, Darby caught 16 passes for 387 yards and seven touchdowns. He is a better player than the Day 3 grades he received over the summer, and with the Pac-12 back on, Darby has a chance to show it.

He was one of our favorite players to watch last season, and he has a year of eligibility remaining after this season.

The 6-foot-2, 235 H-back type has a little more burst as a receiver than 2020 Green Bay Packers third-rounder Joseph Deguara or 2020 Patriots third-rounder Dalton Keene. And the role the Packers expected to use for Deguara before he got hurt is likely to be similar to how Kuithe eventually will be unleashed for an NFL team.

Kuithe isn’t big enough to be a full-time, in-line tight end. Think of him as a fullback, running back, receiver and tight end rolled into one. We tweeted this out when we thought the Pac-12 might not have a season.

Just now sinking in that we won't be seeing Brant Kuithe this season



We'll miss u pic.twitter.com/VEMz2gn0AI — Eric Edholm (@Eric_Edholm) August 19, 2020

There aren’t too many 2021 prospects built in Deng’s mold. He’s 6-foot-5 and somewhere around 230 pounds, a lanky and athletic off-the-ball linebacker with great athleticism. (You’re free to ignore the Cal roster, which lists him at 250 pounds. If he’s that heavy, we’ll eat an entire raw duck.)

Deng isn’t afraid to mix it up inside despite his lack of bulk, and he has intriguing potential to be a blitzing factor as well as the ability to cover tight ends and backs, even if he needs development in that department.

We see him similarly to how we viewed equally lean 2020 Giants sixth-rounder Cam Brown coming out last spring, but with more upside.

We’re in wait-and-see mode on Mills, the former five-star recruit who has been held back by injuries. The Cardinal also figure to be shorthanded this season because of myriad transfers and opt-outs over the past year-plus.

But if Mills can showcase his natural throwing ability, the 6-3, 230-pound Mills fits the mold of a pocket passer with big upside. He threw for 1,070 yards and six touchdowns over Stanford’s final three games, including a 504-yard outing against Washington State.

Watch this beautiful job of avoiding the rush in tight quarters in the red zone and firing a strike for a TD against Oregon State:

View photos Rolling out to the short side, Davis Mills gathered himself and threw a pretty strike for a TD in 2019. More

Does he come out this season or next? We don’t know. He has a first-round ceiling but has yet to show it consistently.

Verdell has some eye-popping burst, as he showed in a brilliant performance in the Pac-12 title game against a terrific Utah defense last season. On 18 carries in that game, Verdell gained 206 yards — 140 of them after first contact — with three TDs.

Strangely, Oregon varied his rushing volume quite a bit last season, and his production was inconsistent — 636 of his 1,220 rush yards came in three games — and often took him off the field on third downs.

Will the Ducks give the 5-9, 210-pound Verdell more receiving work this season? It’s unclear but new offensive coordinator Joe Moorhead had a similar type of back at Fordham, Chase Edmonds, who has carved out a nice role in the NFL with the Arizona Cardinals.

One of our favorite third-down backs in college football, the 5-10, 198-pound Borghi is a natural in the passing game with great hands, nice quickness in his breaks and terrific burst with the ball.

We’ve heard him described as a poor man’s Christian McCaffrey. But Borghi is really more of a slot receiver than running back and lacks McCaffrey’s vision, pace and feel for running inside. Still, any team needing a good pass-catching back will love Borghi’s production and underrated toughness.

When we visited Colorado last summer at the start of camp, we came in asking a lot about Laviska Shenault and Steven Montez. We actually left more fascinated by Landman, whom the previous staff raved about.

Landman has short arms and a smaller frame at 6-foot-2 and 232 pounds. He’s also not an elite athlete for the position. But his instincts, toughness and smarts were all highly spoken of, and it showed up on tape last season.

He might be a Day 3 pick, but Landman has a chance to stick as a solid linebacker for an NFL team.

We’re unsure who the Huskies’ QB will be, and we’ll have to wait to see Otton and his teammates, as their first game of the season was canceled. (NFL scouts also have been told that, as of now, they won’t be allowed to attend games at Husky Stadium this season because of COVID fears.)

The 6-5, 240-pound Otton is considered something of a throwback (he doesn’t wear receiving gloves) and he fits in nicely as an in-line tight end, slot receiver or even offset fullback for the Huskies. He has one more year of eligibility remaining after this season.

17. UCLA QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson

Perhaps the most intriguing Pac-12 QB in this year’s draft mix is the inconsistent but wonderfully talented Thompson-Robinson. His accuracy has been scattershot at times, and the team tended to go as he did.

View photos UCLA QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson is a fascinating prospect if he keeps improving. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) More

With three experienced receivers back and another year marinated in Chip Kelly’s offense, the 6-1, 200-pound Thompson-Robinson has a chance to be a QB sleeper, either in the 2021 draft or in 2022. He possess star power and might be on the verge of his best season yet.

Lenoir has been on the draft radar for a bit now, and we’re happy he opted back into playing after initially saying he’d start his draft prep early.

He’s not terribly big at a shade over 5-foot-10 and 199 pounds. But the feisty, competitive corner backs down from no challenge and will come up and knock a receiver’s block off from the opening whistle.

Lenoir won’t be a fit for every NFL team. He has struggled in zone coverage, lacks top-end speed and can be grabby, but he’d be perfect as an outside corner for a man-heavy system such as that of the Chiefs, Patriots or Titans.

“A real ass kicker” is how one West Coast scout described the undersized Dalman, and the tape backs that up. Dalman measures well below NFL standards at the position at 6-foot-3 and about 290 pounds, but he plays with great leverage and intensity.

Size hasn’t held back NFL standouts such as Jason Kelce and Corey Linsley. He and QB Davis Mills looked great down the stretch last season and could be a standout pair in 2020.

You get a three-way entry here.

The 5-10 Burns came back to school to boost his draft stock, and he’s got really good instincts and patience at the position. The problem is that he’s likely under 170 pounds. His speed could put him on that Donte Jackson spectrum as a prospect.

Jones is only slightly bigger at a verified 5-11 and 172 pounds (spring measurement). He’s not as fast as Burns but has good coverage ability. Teams have tested his size and tackling ability in the past, and it’s an area in which he must keep proving himself.

Jefferson is a sleeper favorite of ours, even after his production slipped last season following a breakout year as a freshman in 2018. Turn on last year’s Washington State game for a sampler of what the 5-9, 215-pound Jefferson can do. The biggest worry with him are his injuries; he had a thoracic spinal fracture in high school that NFL team doctors will closely examine, plus a forearm injury that cut into his 2019 production.

Former Eagles star Malcolm Jenkins delivers cartful of food to Philadelphia election workers as vote count rolls on,['Jack Baer'],"As the 2020 presidential election continued into its fourth day, former Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins wanted to make sure Philadelphia’s election workers were getting the food they needed.

The three-time Pro Bowler, now playing for the New Orleans Saints, escorted a full cart of food from local businesses — Keven Parker's Soul Food Cafe at Reading Terminal Market — to the people counting votes at the the Pennsylvania Convention Center.

Per ESPN’s Tim McManus, Jenkins covered lunch for 300 workers.

The food donation was reportedly made in conjunction with Jenkins’ foundation, which aims to “empower youth to transcend the limits of their circumstance and reach their full potential,” according to its site.

Jenkins spent six seasons with the Eagles, and was a major part of the team’s first Super Bowl championship in 2018. Clearly, he still feels a connection to the city.

Jenkins wasn’t even the only major athlete paying for food for election workers in a swing state, as Atlanta Hawks star Trae Young covered lunch for workers counting votes in Atlanta. The 2020 presidential election has seen a marked increase in engagement from professional athletes, especially as LeBron James’ More Than a Vote initiative pushes for access to voting in key areas.

Jenkins has also spoken extensively about social justice, even when it required confronting a teammate. Jenkins joined CNN in June as a contributor on national affairs.

As of Friday night, former vice president Joe Biden holds a lead of more than 25,000 votes over President Donald Trump for Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes. Per the Associated Press’ map, a win in Pennsylvania would be enough to seal the presidency for the Democratic challenger.

In Philadelphia County specifically, Biden is winning more than 80 percent of the vote.

Justin Turner won't be punished for breaking MLB's quarantine rules following COVID-19 diagnosis,['Mike Oz'],"Major League Baseball has let Justin Turner off the hook following his headline-making decision after World Series Game 6 to break the league’s quarantine rules after he tested positive for COVID-19 during the game.

Turner now infamously came onto the field to celebrate and take pictures with his Los Angeles Dodgers teammates after they won the game and the series. At the time, his choice was blasted by fans and pundits for putting both the Dodgers and Rays at risk, forcing both teams into getting additional tests and delaying their travel plans.

On Friday, however, MLB announced that it had finished its investigation into the incident and would not be punishing Turner. MLB’s investigation said that Turner was encouraged by teammates to join them on the field. Two Dodgers employees gave him “permission,” but MLB admitted it should have had its own security monitoring Turner in that moment.

In his statement, commissioner Rob Manfred said Turner expressed remorse for what he did and even applauded Turner for “making a commitment to set a positive example going forward.”

Here’s the key part of Manfred’s statement:

“Mr. Turner has publicly recognized that his conduct was wrong and has expressed remorse for that conduct. I have spoken to him personally and I know that he is extraordinarily upset by the incident. By all accounts, Justin is a leader in the clubhouse, a contributor to his community and a responsible person who was instrumental in the Dodgers diligently following the health protocols all season long. “Staging a baseball season during the COVID-19 pandemic was an incredibly difficult undertaking and it required significant sacrifices and an enormous amount of work by players, club staff and the Commissioner’s Office. We all have made mistakes as we navigated these unprecedented challenges and have tried to learn from those mistakes so they are not repeated. With this in mind, I am closing this matter by applauding Justin for accepting responsibility, apologizing and making a commitment to set a positive example going forward.”

Turner apologizes, doesn’t make excuses

Along with MLB’s statement, Turner also released a statement of his own, apologizing to everyone affected. He told his side of the story and said he would not make excuses for his conduct.

With the book closed on this ordeal, attention turns to Turner as a free agent. While he’s certainly turned into a face-of-the-franchise type player for the Dodgers — he’s very popular with fans — there are questions about whether the Dodgers would bring him back for his age-36 season with his production slipping.

"Public job, public skepticism: Is Alex Cora really the best manager the Red Sox could find?",['Hannah Keyser'],"I’m not mad that Alex Cora and A.J. Hinch were able to find gainful employment within their chosen field mere days or weeks after their suspensions ended. In fact, I’m not mad at them at all. I don’t know either of them personally, but sign-stealing is a nonviolent crime. And while there’s no evidence about recidivism rates, I imagine public and private scrutiny will impede repeat offenders. Their suspensions lasted exactly as long as they did, and not longer, on purpose; rehabilitation is an important part of justice.

But, as is so often forgotten in the discourse around someone’s return to public life after a scandal, there’s a difference between punitive retribution and literally just logical consequence. I don’t think their association with the 2017 Houston Astros is disqualifying in any way except that it will inevitably invite criticism and columns like this — which is a considerable liability for the face of a team who will have to address the media on a daily basis.

A year after being jettisoned from their roles over MLB’s findings about the 2017 Astros’ brazen sign-stealing scheme, the manager and bench coach who oversaw the scandalous club are back in baseball. Hinch will manage the Detroit Tigers. And as of Friday, Alex Cora will reportedly return to Boston, where he won a World Series and where he was forced to step down even before he was officially suspended after his past caught up to him. Tony La Russa, who oversaw a White Sox team that was credibly accused of stealing signs in the 1980s and a steroid-riddled Oakland A’s clubhouse, is back in Chicago at 76 years old.

It speaks to their track records, the undiminished respect they still garner in certain circles, and that winning still matters above all else. It’s also indicative of — or even an indictment of — the same uncreative groupthink that creates a culture of gatekeeping within the game.

Experts will tell you in one breath how the role of a manager has never been more about liaising between the team and the public, between the front office and the clubhouse. And in the next reiterate as some sort of accepted wisdom that it was inevitable the open opportunities would go to candidates whose sullied reputations will precede any press conference. Whose hiring has to be buried beneath the impending news of a new president, even if it’s embraced by the team itself. That you “shouldn’t be surprised” because it was the “safest choice.”

Cora was a unique case when he was originally hired — one of few Latino managers and the first Puerto Rican to lead his team to a World Series championship. In a sport that’s grown to nearly one-third Latin American, that representation is important. But it’s a form of tokenism to assume Cora is the exception in his ability to manage successfully. After Cora’s Red Sox won in 2018, Dave Martinez, also with Puerto Rican roots, led the Nationals to success the following year. With Cora’s return to the managerial seat, there are four Latin American managers — Rick Renteria would have been the fifth had he not been replaced by La Russa — and even that is disproportionately small compared to the makeup of rosters. If less proven Latino alumni are not given the opportunity to ascend to major league manager, that’s worth interrogating.

It’s a job that entails answering a lot of questions, shouldering a lot of blame, putting a good face on tough times and making the whole operation seem likable. And decision-makers around the game — a group regularly and rightly criticized for their homogeneity — couldn’t find anyone more qualified than three of the most controversial men from baseball’s recent past.

In a sport where the sameness in approach has spoiled so much of the fun, they couldn’t find anyone new anywhere in the industry worth taking a shot on. Irrespective of your feelings (or my feelings) about Cora, Hinch, or La Russa, that’s so disappointing.

"Russell Wilson is NFL's midseason MVP, but he has 4 other QBs nipping at his heels","['Terez Paylor', 'Senior Nfl Writer']","If you follow the NFL, you probably know that Russell Wilson is having a killer season.

You might not realize how good, how historic, he has been. Aside from lifting a team with a middling pass rush and an uneven defense to a 6-1 record that is tops in the NFL’s best division, did you know that Wilson is on track to throw 59 touchdown passes this season?

I repeat: Russell Wilson is on pace to throw 59 touchdown passes in 2020.

Maybe he really is Mr. Unlimiiiiiiiiiited.

So, yeah, after you’re done cringing at that joke, you should take a moment to further digest the historic pace he’s on, which also happens to be the reason Wilson is the midseason favorite for NFL MVP.

He has his fair share of “wow” moments this year, a necessity to be MVP, like his five-touchdown performance in a thrilling Sunday night win over Cam Newton and the New England Patriots, or any of his rainbow-like deep strikes to DK Metcalf, who is looking very much like a Terrell Owens clone.

Yet, for as good as Wilson has been, this race is far from over.

The case for Patrick Mahomes and Kyler Murray

There’s no shortage of other quarterbacks having huge seasons, ones who could also be MVP worthy in the end.

One example: Look no further than Kansas City, where another electric, live-armed quarterback with a penchant for the amazing is quietly having another awesome season. Patrick Mahomes already once stood in the way of Wilson winning MVP — Mahomes topped 50 touchdown passes in 2018, Wilson’s best season to date — and he may do it again.

Mahomes is on pace for another crazy statistical season. After his four-touchdown evisceration of the Baltimore Ravens in Week 3, smart teams have been content to play lots of deep zone against Mahomes, openly conceding short passes and light boxes to prevent the Chiefs from going on the type of Golden State Warriors-like runs they generate by connecting on deep balls.

And while Mahomes is a gunslinger to his core, the 25-year-old has smartly let the game come to him, taking what the defense gives him as the Chiefs are 7-1.

That hasn’t kept him from putting up gaudy stats. He’s on track to finish with over 4,600 passing yards and a ridiculous 42 touchdowns and only two interceptions, the type of numbers MVP voters can’t overlook if he keeps it up and the Chiefs finish with the NFL’s best record, which are both possibilities.

View photos Kyler Murray and the Cardinals are keeping pace with the Seahawks in the NFC West. (Photo by Norm Hall/Getty Images) More

And speaking of possibilities, here’s another one: you better start putting respect on Kyler Murray’s name. What Murray, 23, has accomplished this year for the 5-2 Cardinals — the 5-2 Cardinals! — is spectacular.

Aside from giving hope to short kids everywhere who aspire to be NFL quarterbacks, Murray has played the position with a unique flair, repeatedly scrambling past defenders as the fastest person on the field and throwing darts while never, ever allowing himself to be hit hard. It’s like watching a skinny Tyreek Hill in the shotgun, except he’s throwing missiles every other play.

Seriously, Murray has been so fun to watch this season. He’s on pace to finish with approximately 46 total touchdowns. It makes me mad to think about all the electric quarterbacks of the past we missed out on seeing in the NFL, all because they were told they needed to move to different positions since they didn’t fit the physical benchmarks of the position.

NFL bad beat: 49ers score with 4 seconds left to push the game over as Joe Buck and Troy Aikman crack jokes,['Frank Schwab'],"It’s probably noble that the San Francisco 49ers didn’t want to give up long after Thursday night’s game was decided.

If you bet on the under, it didn’t feel so warm and fuzzy.

The 49ers, unable to do anything on offense all night against the Green Bay Packers, finally found liife in the final few minutes. 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan called a timeout instead of letting the final seconds run out. The 49ers ran empty sets and went to no huddle.

With 4 seconds left the game went over the total. Troy Aikman and Joe Buck noticed.

Under looked safe most of Thursday night

The over/under opened at 51, and was down to 48 at BetMGM by kickoff. Of all the money bet on the over/under, 55.5% was on the under.

Those under bets looked great until about five minutes left. The depleted 49ers offense couldn’t move the ball. The Packers started easing up, running the ball most of the fourth quarter. The Packers led 31-3 about halfway through the fourth quarter, and they had no reason to score anymore. Even when Mason Crosby barely hit a 53-yard field goal with a little more than six minutes left, it was 34-3 and bettors had at least an 11-point cushion.

Most teams at that point give up. They don’t want to take on any extra injuries — and the 49ers have taken on what seems like 100 injuries this season — and just want the game to end.

Shanahan didn’t want the game to end.

49ers score in final seconds

The 49ers’ first possession after the Packers’ field goal indicated they were still trying to move the ball and finish the game with some positive feelings. They ran an empty formation with Mullens.

The 49ers never let up. They kept passing. Richie James scored on a 41-yard touchdown with about five minutes left. Uh oh. The Packers ran three times and punted. The 49ers needed a touchdown to ruin Thursday night for a few people. A sack by the Packers, which would have probably clinched the under, was nullified because of the defender initiated contact with Mullens using his helmet. Jerick McKinnon was tackled near the sideline and the clock kept running, and instead of letting time run, Shanahan called timeout with 39 seconds left even though his team had no chance to win. At that point, under bettors had to know what was coming.

Buck understood. The Fox play-by-play announcer made a joke about some people still being interested in what was going on, a reference to the over/under that was in the balance. NBC’s Al Michaels often makes similar cracks about people sweating bets late in games.

The 49ers got to the 1-yard line and McKinnon punched in a touchdown with 4 seconds to go.

“You mentioned Al Michaels a bit earlier. Now I feel like Al Michaels,” Buck said, regarding his sly comments about the over/under.

“I thought you handled that very well,” Aikman said after a long laugh.

It’s nice those two could have some fun about it. Plenty of bettors weren’t in the mood for a laugh.

"An uncertain winter brings MLB, players union to the edge of more tense labor talks","['Tim Brown', 'Mlb Columnist']","They handed out some trophies and took some pictures and a few dozen men dabbed at the memories of a lifetime just more than a week ago, at the end of the longest three-month baseball season they ever played. If it wasn’t exactly baseball as we remembered, it passed for something close enough. Any complaints would be drowned out anyway, by the applause for the effort, the hard exhales of relieved moms and dads and friends, and all that hollering on a random diamond down in Texas.

A lot of planning and a little luck got them all through to the end, down one poor soul in the seventh inning of the final game but seemingly with no real harm done, all from the dawn of summer, from the moment of “Tell us when and where.”

The agreement between the players and owners that got them through it — prorated salaries, a hundred-and-some pages of protocols, weeks of loud and undignified negotiations that eventually landed them at 60 games in 66 days — is expired. The pandemic is not. There is no vaccine. The NFL is struggling to stay ahead of the virus. The NBA has been out of its bubble for less than a month and will suit up again next month or try.

Baseball players, for now, are expected to report back to spring training in a little over three months, but that’s just today’s plan and with cases rising again in Arizona and Florida. Opening day is scheduled for April 1. There were more than 120,000 new cases of the virus in the United States on Thursday, a one-day record.

On the occasion of Game 6 of the World Series, commissioner Rob Manfred told Sportico that his 30 teams are $8.3 billion in debt, less sobering in an accounting sense than in how the players union viewed it, which was as the first volley in the next labor negotiation. That bit of presumed untidiness — that is, the terms under which the 2021 season will be played — stands between today and the looming deadline that is the end of the current collective bargaining agreement, about a year from now. Already there are conversations between the sides addressing health and safety protocols moving forward, though at a time they cannot know what the health and safety of the country might be in three months, if there will be a vaccine, who might take or resist a vaccine, what state and local regulations might say about fans in ballparks and, if the past eight months are a clue, any one of many, many obstacles that are so far invisible.

Tony Clark, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, was in his New York City office Thursday evening and glad for it. Because of possible exposure to the coronavirus, he’d been 3 ½ weeks in a Dallas hotel room — his own personal bubble — during October. He never contracted the virus.

The fight is ahead. The union has the right to grieve the terms by which the past season was played, for financial damages allegedly suffered by players and by claiming the owners had negotiated in bad faith. The league has the right to defend itself and will. The owners did not make the sort of money they ordinarily do. Neither did the players. Neither did thousands of stadium workers, thousands of team employees and millions of other Americans.

The work is ahead. Clark operates in his seventh year leading the union, now amid speculation over whether he has the full confidence of his players. He loves the game and its soul because for a substantial part of his life it has been his game and his soul. Now he and his staff sit amid the swirl of a pandemic, the real life and economic impacts of that, and must choose a course that serves their union, the game and its fans. The target won’t stand still. The relationship between the union and MLB is in tatters. Nobody can know what tomorrow will bear. On the way to tomorrow, no one trusts anyone, generally because of what has happened over so many yesterdays.

Can Notre Dame pull off upset against Clemson? Here are 6 keys and a prediction,['Pete Thamel'],"By nearly every metric, Brian Kelly has done a resplendent job resuscitating the Notre Dame football program. In his 11 seasons, he has won 72% of his games, reached one BCS title game and registered one College Football Playoff appearance.

Perhaps most impressive, Kelly has built Notre Dame to the point where it’s a forgone conclusion the Irish will be nationally ranked, competitive and relevant. After taking over amid a din of questions about whether Notre Dame could uphold its independent status or deserved a spot in college football’s postseason, Kelly has guided Notre Dame to consistent relevance.

The one nag on his résumé would be the lack of an iconic win, the kind that inspires T-shirts and documentaries, adding lore to a program steeped with it. Notre Dame has a chance at one of those victories on Saturday, with No. 1 Clemson coming to South Bend, Indiana, without star quarterback Trevor Lawrence.

The game is ripe with opportunity for No. 4 Notre Dame (6-0), which can state its playoff case before, perhaps, needing to make the same claim in December at the ACC title game in Charlotte.

Is this edition of Notre Dame good enough to awaken the ghosts of Irish past? Yahoo Sports spoke to eight coaches and assistants who’ve played or studied Notre Dame this year for their thoughts. (We went Notre Dame heavy because we dialed into Clemson before the Miami game.)

Here are the six keys to Notre Dame pulling off the upset, according to those who’ve played the Irish.

View photos Clemson coach Dabo Swinney talks to Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly before their game on Oct. 3, 2015. (Streeter Lecka/Getty Images) More

Clemson-Notre Dame: Exploit the matchups

One coach brought up a fascinating point: These teams have reached this top-five level in two completely different ways. Both programs are nearly a decade into building to a specific identity, but a very different one.

Notre Dame’s is simple. “They are big, physical, have great size and fundamentals,” said an opposing assistant. “They beat you with power and strength.”

Clemson is contrasting. “They have dynamic athletes at every position and they are fast. It’s going to be which style works on that given day is going to determine the outcome.”

For the Irish, the offensive strengths are obvious. While their offensive line doesn’t have top-10 maulers like Mike McGlinchey and Quenton Nelson in 2017, one assistant coach who studied them that season said this offensive line may be better as a whole unit.

Left tackle Liam Eichenberg is the group’s star, but what impressed the coaches more was “the cohesiveness of it all.” Another coach pointed out that Notre Dame’s line can lean on teams over games and eventually exploit its physical superiority.

Will that be the case against Clemson? While Lawrence’s absence gobbles up the oxygen, Clemson will also be without its best linebacker (James Skalski), best defensive tackle (Tyler Davis) and another starting linebacker (Mike Jones Jr.) because of injury.

That will leave Clemson DC Brent Venables’ unit playing a slew of young players and could be vulnerable. Can Notre Dame’s line lean on those young players and execute soul-crushing drives like the 15-play, 81-yard march to open the Georgia Tech game? Notre Dame isn’t going to win a shootout, so ball control will be key.

Keep it simple for Notre Dame QB Ian Book

Notre Dame senior quarterback Ian Book is a very good college quarterback who lacks some of the high-end dynamism that we’ve seen in recent elite teams. If Notre Dame’s offensive line can exploit Clemson’s young defensive front, it not only allows Book to avoid having to throw downfield, but it also creates passing lanes necessary for a quarterback of his modest stature (6 foot).

“My critique of Ian Book is that he won’t consistently make the throws,” said an opposing assistant. “If they had an elite, elite quarterback, they’d be special this season. He has a way of being uneasy in the pocket and taking off. That fits into Clemson’s hands and defensive speed, which gives them opportunity to create negative plays and get them off schedule.”

Did the 49ers swing a local California election?,['Henry Bushnell'],"Millions of dollars spent by San Francisco 49ers CEO Jed York appear to have successfully swung local elections in Santa Clara, California – and changed the makeup of the city's council, which York’s Niners have sparred with for years.

Three of four candidates backed by York, whose family owns the Niners, won Santa Clara City Council seats this week, ousting an incumbent and two other establishment choices in the process.

They won, in part, because York poured roughly $3 million into their campaigns. York’s money accounted for around 90% of all spending on city council campaigns. It amounted to roughly $50 per registered voter, and roughly $150 per vote in the four city council races combined.

And York spent it, via his political action committee, with a purpose. The Niners have said that purpose was to diversify a previously-all-white council that didn’t reflect its city. (Santa Clara is 43% white; three of York’s favored candidates are Asian-American.) Critics, however, argue the team merely wants to reshape a council that has not been amenable to its interests, and turn the city into “Yorkville.”

“It’s shocking and obnoxious,” Santa Clara Mayor Lisa Gillmor told the San Francisco Chronicle last month. “He’s unhappy with the way Santa Clara is holding him accountable and he seems to figure it’s cheaper to buy the city council seats.”

The 49ers’ messy relationship with Santa Clara

The 49ers are in Year 7 of a decades-long marriage with Santa Clara. They moved to Levi’s Stadium, their new billion-dollar home, in 2014. Almost immediately, their relationship with the city soured.

Gillmor, a former councilwoman who ascended to mayor in 2016, and her allies have sparred with the team over everything from soccer fields to unpaid rent. The Niners, in one of many emblematic squabbles, have begged the city to loosen a 10 p.m. weeknight curfew to allow for concerts at the stadium. The city hasn’t budged. The Niners have pushed for more oversight of the stadium, which the city helped finance and which it controls. The city council has pushed back. It has moved to sever an agreement that allowed the team to operate NFL and non-NFL events at Levi’s, alleging fraud and willful misconduct. The Niners have sued to block that action.

The two parties have quarreled over revenue splits and other matters. They’re locked in several legal battles, some of which have spilled out into public. Rahul Chandhok, the Niners’ vice president of public affairs and strategic communications, has frequently criticized Gillmor. Gillmor and her team sometimes fire back. The whole relationship is extremely messy.

The city has won most battles because Gillmor allies held a strong majority on the council. It’s that majority that York sought to upend. He reportedly lives 10 miles west of the city, in Los Altos Hills, and presumably didn’t have a vote in Tuesday’s election. Instead, because U.S. laws don’t limit individual political expenditure, he simply reached into his wallet.

Jed York’s big political spending

York didn’t handpick the candidates. But they were “relative unknowns,” according to the San Jose Mercury News.

That is, until York’s money started coming in. As of late last month, City of Santa Clara records show over $500,000 spent by York and the 49ers on each of the four city council races. His contributions dwarfed all others.

Brian Kelly's impressive Notre Dame career still missing key element — a big win,['Dan Wetzel'],"After a decade in which Brian Kelly has, once again, made 10-win seasons, bowl victories and top-five rankings somewhat routine at Notre Dame, it’s easy to forget its previous 15-year run of irrelevance.

Bob Davie, Tyrone Willingham and Charlie Weis combined for a .576 win percentage, one bowl victory and endless talk about how the Fighting Irish would, except in old movies, never matter again.

So make no mistake, Kelly has been a Golden Dome-sent gift for Notre Dame. The Irish are good nearly every year, really good in some, and if nothing else, almost always in the national discussion in both big games and recruiting. They matter.

They just haven’t won a big one, a really big one, in a long, long time (they are 1-18 against top-five teams since 1999).

No. 1 Clemson visits South Bend on Saturday, giving Kelly’s fourth-ranked team another crack at proving it belongs not just among the nation’s top teams, but in that rarified air of the elite of the elite.

Considering the two teams could stage a rematch in December’s ACC title game, this isn’t must-win for the 6-0 Irish’s playoff or title hopes. A victory would be more emotional than anything else.

Beating a great team, especially from the Southeast, is about the only thing that has eluded Kelly’s program. And until you can beat those kinds of teams — namely Alabama, Clemson and Georgia — you can’t win a national title.

Kelly has taken Notre Dame to one BCS title game (a 42-14 loss to Alabama to end the 2012 season) and one College Football Playoff (a 30-3 semifinal defeat to Clemson in 2018).

There have been numerous regular season shortfalls too, everything from nail-biters to blowouts.

The Irish have had close losses to Georgia in both 2019 (23-17) and 2017 (20-19); a 41-8 blowout loss at Miami in 2017; a 50-47 double-overtime heartbreaker to Texas in 2016; a 24-22 loss in a thriller in a downpour at Clemson in 2015; and a 31-27 defeat to Florida State in 2014.

Notre Dame has beaten good teams, mostly highly ranked Michigan, Michigan State, Stanford and USC clubs.

Other than a 30-13 victory in 2012 of No. 8 Oklahoma in Norman though, these huge intersectional matchup games haven’t worked out. That Notre Dame has gotten to this point — which is higher than many critics ever allowed for — is commendable. The final peak is still there to scale though.

Brian Kelly wants no part of this discussion, this narrative, this storyline, of course. All of that is understandable.

""This game, it's not the end-all for us,"" Kelly said this week. ""We could win this game, but you could lose to [Boston College the following game] and this doesn't mean anything.

“It's about consistency in performance, which we're well on our way to checking that box,” he continued. “We've shown an incredible consistency as a football team of winning week in and week out. Look, you want to win these games, there's no doubt, but we can't be overly emotional about this football game and lose sight of the fact that we've got five more games to play.”

This is exactly what Nick Saban would say. Maybe not Dabo Swinney, who for years obsessed about the meaning of “little ole Clemson” finally getting past Florida State or an SEC powerhouse and even installed a graveyard next to the football facility to commemorate victories over ranked opponents.

That’s fine, Dabo is Dabo. Kelly doesn’t need to add hype to a game that will be decided by execution, not media and fan angles.

""We can't empty the tank and say, 'Hey, we've beat Clemson, we've arrived,’” Kelly said. “No, we haven't.""

The proof of that is the Irish have consistently lost these big showdowns, yet the program has gotten stronger and stronger anyway. That loss to Texas didn’t send the Irish reeling. It’s the Longhorns who aren’t good. Same with Miami. And when Notre Dame beat Florida State, 42-26, earlier this year, it wasn’t even considered a big game."
Week 9 Sleepers in Fantasy Football,['Liz Loza'],"Fantasy football in 2020 requires patience, flexibility, and a whole lot of woooooosaaaah. The most dedicated and passionate managers get that … since they continue to find zeal in exploring the concepts and happenings occurring under the radar. While there are times your roster may allow for snoozing on sleepers, it’s always beneficial to keep tabs on emerging trends and players. This weekly column is for those who understand the satisfaction of digging deep.

[Week 9 Fantasy Rankings: QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | FLEX | DST | Kickers]

All of the listed players are rostered in under 60 percent of Yahoo leagues (at time of writing) and/or are a significant value in our daily game. They’re not the obvious picks, and they’re not without their risks … but that’s what makes them so intriguing. In Week 8, the wins included slam dunks Brandon Aiyuk (8-91-1) and bonus pick DeeJay Dallas (RB4). On the other hand, Derek Carr, Rashard Higgins, La’Mical Perine, and Richard Rodgers all underwhelmed.

Let’s focus on the future and see what fantasy damage we can do in Week 9!

We’ve got four teams on bye, Jimmy G is out, there’s a QB competition in Dallas, and Matt Stafford is on the COVID list. Drew Lock may not be the Week 9 stream we wanted, but he is who we deserve (in #2020). While I have an admitted affinity for the second-year player out of Mizzou, his professional performance has been suspect at best. Still, the green gunslinger is coming off an impressive Week 8 OT victory in which he earned a QB rating of 94.4. Throwing for 248 yards, 3 TDs, and 1 INT, Lock closed out Sunday as the QB8 in fantasy.

This Sunday, he’ll take on a Falcons defense that’s allowing an average of over 320 passing yards and the most FF points per contest. Atlanta’s pass rush has been anemic, logging just 13 sacks on the season. That trend doesn’t figure to change in Week 9 given that Takk McKinley (groin) and Dante Fowler (hamstring) are both banged up. Furthermore, Denver’s defense is hobbled, which means this could turn into a bit of a ping-pong match, as reflected by the 50 point projection set by Vegas. With Tim Patrick working his way back on the field, Noah Fant’s rebounding health, and the emergence of (my Week 8 Fantasy Damage pick) Albert O, Drew Lock demands top-15 consideration.

Matt Breida has done as much for the Dolphins as Max Boyens did for the last cycle of “Vanderpump Rules.” Unlike Max, however, Breida has a chance to redeem himself. With Myles Gaskin (MCL) sidelined, the former 49er is in line for a larger workload.

An explosive talent with top-end speed (remember this play?), Breida could rip off a few long runs versus a Cardinals defense that’s better against the pass than they are the run. Allowing a YPC of 4.7 to opposing rushers, Arizona’s run-stopping unit has also given up six runs over 20 yards. With a rookie QB under center and Miami trying to play keep away from Kyler Murray, the volume for Breida additionally figures to remain steady. Assuming he’s GTG (Breida has struggled through obvious durability issues and is currently dealing with a hammy tweak), the 25-year-old could close out Sunday inside of the top-25 fantasy producers at the position.

In what’s shaping up to be a pretty boring week, Hall offers some out-of-the-box excitement. With Kenny Golladay (hip) out for Week 9, Marvin Jones and Danny Amendola will probably see a bump in targets drawn. But gross. And who cares? If you’re chasing points and need to splash, then throw a dart at the lid-lifter coming off a career effort.

Converting four-of-seven looks for 113 yards last Sunday, Hall showcased his deep-play ability versus a formidable Colts defense. This week he’ll face off against a banged-up Vikings unit that listed four of its CBs on Wednesday’s injury report. Heading into Week 9, Minnesota’s secondary has allowed the most receptions over 40 yards (7), the most TDs (15), and the third-most fantasy points to opposing pass-catchers. Over his career, Hall has not been consistent, but when he booms, he booms hard and a ceiling game is entirely possible given the matchup and Golladay’s absence.

A wild scenario involving the Patriots trading Bill Belichick that just could work,['Nick Ashooh'],"A wild scenario involving the Patriots trading Bill Belichick that just could work originally appeared on NBC Sports Washington

It's clear they're losing their minds in Boston. It's understandable, they're not used to seeing the Patriots lose.

Sure, we've seen our fair share of horrible seasons with the Washington Football Team, so we're pros at how to handle all the mounting losses, but clearly, in New England, they're taking the death of their dynasty pretty hard, and Boston sports media is creating some wild scenarios for what could come next.

This includes the idea of trading Bill Belichick.

First off, I'm here for the chaos. Not just up there because all they do is win and I'm jealous, but because I love hearing wild scenarios we know likely would never happen.

I support creative thinking and I'm not ashamed.

Now, before you continue to laugh at the whole trade idea that was brought up on The Greg Hill Show on WEEI, remember that Belichick resigned as the head coach of the Jets, only to come to the Patriots in exchange for the 16th overall pick in the 2000 draft. This type of scenario, though rare, has happened before.

While the Patriots sit at 2-5 and Tom Brady rolls through another MVP-caliber season, the doubts about their head coach are natural. He's 68, has a terrible roster, and who knows how much longer he'd actually want to do this. It's not like anyone in that organization is used to going through a rebuild, and I don't see Belichick being all that happy about starting one (then again he's never happy about anything so that doesn't say much).

Do I think this could come to fruition? I'd give it a 10 percent chance. All you need is one team that likes their roster but definitely needs a coach to round it out that maybe would be willing to talk to Robert Kraft about the idea. Belichick has to be in too though, and the pieces have to fall just right.

Wait, what if the Jets land the No. 1 overall pick, take Trevor Lawrence, and trade to bring back their former coach who really didn't actually coach games there, and it all comes full circle?

Now this is the type of storyline that would turn the NFL upside down.

I'm in. Let's make this happen New England."
Patrick Mahomes names his favorite quarterbacks,['Doug Farrar'],"Patrick Mahomes is obviously one of the NFL’s best quarterbacks — perhaps the NFL’s best quarterback, depending on the given week — but when push comes to shove, and he has to eliminate himself from the discussion, which quarterbacks does he respect the most for their own attributes?

On the most recent episode of the highly-recommended “Huddle and Flow” podcast, hosted by Steve Wyche and Jim Trotter of the NFL Network, Mahomes went through his own favorite quarterbacks in certain situations.

The full episode can be found on @ApplePodcasts and @spotifypodcasts as well as other major podcast platforms. Thanks for listening. #HuddleAndFlow — Jim Trotter (@JimTrotter_NFL) November 5, 2020





Arm talent: “Aaron Rodgers. He’s a guy who has the fastball, but he also has every other pitch. He can throw it as far as you want, and he can throw it as accurately as you want. You have to have everything if you want to be at the top of that ‘arm talent’ list.”

Mobility: “Lamar Jackson. You can’t tackle him, man. I saw him hit the sideline against us, and he barely stepped out of bounds, but he was almost out of there.”

Ability to read the blitz: “Tom Brady. That’s an easy one, man. It’s like he’s seen it all, and he knows it’s coming before it even comes.”

Two minutes left in the game, and down by a score, who are you giving the ball? “Russell Wilson. He’s done it week in and week out fo rhis entire career. He’s going to be level-headed, and he’s always positive — I think you can see it in those ‘Mic’d Up’ things. If it wasn’t myself, I would give it to Russell.”

Mahomes also named New England’s Stephon Gilmore as the most challenging cornerback he’s faced.

“He’s going to get up and play physical. He’s good in zone and man coverage, and he’s a special player out there.”

Finally, Mahomes’ selection for the one pass-rusher he always has to account for made a lot of sense.

“Aaron Donald. That dude’s a beast. I don’t know how many times I’ve been strip-sacked in my career — it wasn’t a lot, but he did it to me twice in one game. After that, I was trying to send as many people his way [as possible].”

Mahomes, who is coming off a five-touchdown performance against the Jets last Sunday, takes on the Panthers in Week 9."
Patrick Mahomes responds to picking up write-in votes for president,['Jason Owens'],"(Yahoo) More

Patrick Mahomes for president.

There’s certainly a swath of Kansas City Chiefs fans who would be on board with that prospect — after he’s done competing for a few more Super Bowls, that is.

But some are ready to send him to the White House now. Mahomes received write-in votes for president in Clay County, Missouri this week, Fox 4 KC’s Harold Kuntz reports. How many is unclear.

It should come as no surprise that some Chiefs fans believe their beloved quarterback is infallible and capable of running the country in these most difficult of times. This is how sports fandom often works.

Or maybe they were just content burning their presidential vote because of the realities of the Electoral College.

Mahomes responds to White House support

Either way, Mahomes was faced with fielding questions Wednesday about his write-in votes. He deftly avoided saying anything that sounds like commentary on this week’s heated election and focused on Arrowhead Stadium being used a a polling place this year instead.

“First off, it’s funny for sure,” Mahomes said. “I think Arrowhead ended up being a great spot for people to come together, go out and get your vote. ... hopefully we can continue to do that.”

But what about those votes?

“Funny getting written in, but that’s not anywhere I’m thinking right now,” Mahomes continued. “Maybe later on I’ll think of a slogan or something like that.”

Those are the words of a quarterback equally adept at the art of avoiding stepping in controversy as he is playing the position. Well played.

Panthers are about to witness greatness in Patrick Mahomes. How can they slow him down?,['Scott Fowler'],"Given that Carolina has never played against Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes before, let me phrase his talent in terms that a Panthers fan can easily understand.

Do you remember Cam Newton’s breathtaking year in 2015, when he accounted for 45 total TDs for the Panthers and was voted the NFL’s Most Valuable Player?

That’s Mahomes — every single year. The Panthers are about to have a front-row seat to greatness in full bloom, whether they want it or not.

Sunday’s big question: Can they do anything to slow it down?

After famously sitting on the bench behind Alex Smith as an NFL rookie in 2017, Mahomes burst onto the scene as a starter for the Chiefs in 2018 at an MVP level and never has throttled down.

Only 25, Mahomes will make his 40th career regular-season start against Carolina on Sunday in Arrowhead Stadium. If Mahomes throws at least three TD passes vs. the Panthers, he will become the fastest QB to 100 TD passes in NFL history.

If any Panther picks him off, on the other hand, that player should keep that football forever.

Mahome’s TD/interception ratio this season looks like a misprint: 21 TDs, 1 INT. The Chiefs, who became Super Bowl champions in February by overcoming three straight double-digit deficits in the playoffs due to Mahomes’ theatrics, are 7-1 this season and anchored once again by their young gunslinger.

“He’s got an unbelievable arm,” Panthers defensive coordinator Phil Snow said of Mahomes, “and he can throw it from a lot of different angles. He can throw on the move, left or right, side-arm. It’s just amazing. At times, you look like you’re watching a guy out in the playground. ... He’s really fun to watch. The other guy in the league that kind of does the same thing is Russell Wilson in Seattle.”

Panthers to face 4 QB greats

The Panthers (3-5) don’t have Wilson on their schedule this season. But they do have to face four future Pro Football Hall of Fame QBs — Mahomes, Tom Brady, Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers — in the second half of the 2020 season. They have played three of those men multiple times before.

Mahomes, though, is a new one, since Carolina only faces the teams from the AFC West once every four seasons.

View photos Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes has already won a Super Bowl and an NFL Most Valuable Player award, and he is only 25. More

Young Carolina players like defensive end Brian Burns — who referred to Mahomes as “Patty” during his group interview this week — and cornerback Donte Jackson have mostly just seen Mahomes play on TV prior to Sunday.

“Everything runs through (Mahomes),” said Burns, whose knack for strip-sacks might be Carolina’s best chance to force a Mahomes turnover Sunday. “We can pressure him. Keep him uncomfortable in the pocket. Hit him a lot.”

Said Jackson, who leads Carolina with three interceptions but has been fighting a nagging toe injury: “There are a lot of quarterbacks in this league that, once you get them off their spot, they’re different guys in terms of the throws they can make and the things they can do. ... He’s just one of those rare guys that it really doesn’t matter. … The only thing that really matters is getting him on the ground.”

Patrick Mahomes’ massive contract

I asked Kansas City coach Andy Reid on a conference call this week what made Mahomes special.

“He wants to be the best, but you never know it by the way he carries himself around the building,” Reid said. “He wants everybody to be a part of it. And he’s pure team. But at the same time, he’s got that mental toughness, where he wants to get after you. And when it’s time to compete, he competes. ... He doesn’t wait until game day just to do that, either. He’s going to bust his tail all week long. … He doesn’t miss anything. He’s on time and, normally, he’s three hours early. That’s just how he rolls.”

Cowboys (obviously) regret taking Taco Charlton over T.J. Watt,['Charean Williams'],"In every draft, every team has a regret (or two or three).

Some are bigger than others. Some are harder to explain than others.

Take the 2017 draft. Everyone knew the Cowboys would take a pass rusher after Benson Mayowa led them with six sacks in 2016. It was just a matter of which one.

When their turn came, at 28th overall, the Cowboys had the choice of Michigan’s Taco Charlton or Wisconsin’s T.J. Watt.

It seems like a no-brainer now, but the Cowboys selected Charlton and the Steelers chose Watt two picks later.

Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones admitted regret Friday.

“Absolutely,” Jones said on 105.3 The Fan. “You always do that, if you’re truthful and you’re honest – what you might could have had.”

Watt has 41 career sacks, including 6.5 this season, and earned All-Pro honors last year. Charlton lasted only two seasons in Dallas, spent time in Miami and now plays in Kansas City. He has 11 career sacks, including two this season for the Chiefs.

Jones confirmed what long has been intimated in Dallas: Then defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli wanted Charlton.

Mike Nolan replaced Marinelli as defensive coordinator this season, with Marinelli now in Las Vegas as the Raiders’ defensive line coach. The Cowboys have switched from the Tampa Two to a more multiple scheme.

Watt would fit perfectly. (Of course, Watt would fit any team in any scheme.)

“The harder part of that is [Watt] was in serious contention [at No. 28],” Jones said. “I think the biggest issue was we were playing a 4-3 there with Rod, and Rod was concerned about how he’d hold up against the run in the 4-3. [He] didn’t have that same concern with Taco. Obviously, if you had that to do all over again, I wish we would have done that, and, of course, he would fit in probably better in some of the things we’re trying to do now with coach Nolan and our defense. So, you know, he’s obviously a great player. He’s already on his way to a great career, not unlike his brother, and congratulate the Steelers for getting him.”

Breeders' Cup 2020: Everything you need to know about the biggest day in horse racing,"['Dan Wolken', 'Usa Today']","The 37th edition of the Breeders’ Cup will be run without fans in attendance due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but horse racing’s premiere year-ending event has not lost any of its luster or its purse money. Some of the best in the world will compete at Keeneland Race Course in Lexington, Kentucky, in a series of 14 races spread out over two days, building to a crescendo with the Classic and Horse of the Year honors on the line.

Here is a breakdown of Saturday’s races.

Filly & Mare Sprint

Purse: $1 million

Distance: 7 furlongs

Post time: 12:02 p.m. ET

Saturday’s card kicks off with a strong field of nine led by the brilliant 3-year old Gamine (7-5), who is cutting back to her wheelhouse distance after proving with her third-place finish in the Kentucky Oaks that a mile and an eighth is a bridge too far. The question will be whether she’s fast enough to press Serengeti Empress (3-1), who will almost certainly set the pace. Horse to watch: Bell’s the One (6-1), who rallied late to beat Serengeti Empress by a nose in the Derby City Distaff two months ago.

Turf Sprint

Purse: $1 million

Distance: 5 1/2 furlongs

Post time: 12:39 p.m. ET

After finishing second in other Breeders’ Cup events the last two years, the 5-year old mare Got Stormy (7-2) will try to beat the boys this time and comes into the race in good form, having won her last two starts. She’ll face a tough challenge from Leinster (4-1), who impressively won the Woodford Stakes in October on this same track and distance. Horse to watch: Front Run the Fed (12-1) is inexperienced in top-level stakes but comes from the barn of Chad Brown, who wins more big turf races than any trainer in America.

Dirt Mile

Purse: $1 million

Distance: 1 mile

Post time: 1:18 p.m. ET

Complexity’s (2-1) win in the Kelso Handicap at Saratoga in a fast time of 1:33.82 launched him into the role of favorite for this race, but Mr. Freeze (6-1) has a recent win over the Keeneland surface while Owendale (8-1) might find this spot a bit easier after knocking heads with Classic entries like Tom’s d’Etat and By My Standards earlier this year. Horse to watch: Art Collector (6-1) was one of the Kentucky Derby favorites until developing a minor foot issue.

Filly & Mare Turf

Purse: $2 million

Distance: 1 3/16 miles

Post time: 1:57 p.m. ET

Chad Brown will saddle four of the 14 entries in this race, including Sistercharlie (6-1), who won it two years ago and has seven Grade 1 victories to her credit. But there’s some question about her 2020 form, as a light schedule left her with just two prep races, both of which produced third-place finishes. Instead, Rushing Fall (5-2) has moved to the front of the line in the Brown barn by going 3-for-3 this year. Horse to watch: Mean Mary (7-2) only came up a neck short of Rushing Fall in the Aug. 23 Diana Stakes, her first loss of the year after winning three stakes races at long distances.

Sprint

Purse: $2 million

Distance: 6 furlongs

Post time: 2:36 p.m. ET

Morning line favorite Vekoma was scratched with a fever, changing the complexion of the race. The hard-knocking Firenze Fire (8-1) dances every dance and usually factors in the mix, but his win in the Vosburgh in September might have been the best of his career. He and C Z Rocket (7-2), who two of the big sprint stakes in California this summer, should be poised to fight it out at the top of the stretch Horse to watch: 3-year old Yaupon (7-2) made his career debut in June and has quickly climbed the ladder, looking like the real deal in all four of his career victories.

Mile

Purse: $2 million

Distance: 1 mile

Post time: 3:15 p.m. ET

Uni (5-1) will try to become the fifth horse to win this race in back-to-back years, but the Mile could be the most wide-open and interesting betting race of the day. With Uni falling off a bit from what she was last year, the 3-year old colt Kameko (6-1) looks intriguing coming in from England after winning the prestigious 2000 Guineas at this distance in June. There will be a lot of support as well for Ivar (4-1), who won the Shadwell Mile at Keeneland in his last start. Horse to watch: Digital Age (8-1) has shown class but mostly at longer distances. Is he fast enough to win at a mile?

No. 9 BYU dominates in 51-17 win over No. 21 Boise State,['Nick Bromberg'],"BYU’s path to an undefeated regular season is pretty clear. Though it might have been better for the Cougars if Boise State was able to put up more of a fight.

No. 9 BYU had no problem beating No. 21 Boise State 51-17 on Friday night. The Cougars’ 13-point halftime lead of 16-3 was the biggest deficit Boise State had faced at halftime since the Broncos trailed 24-0 in the 2005 MPC Computers Bowl.

BYU (8-0) easily added to that margin too. The Cougars got the ball to start the second half and made it 23-3 in less than 150 seconds. The lead quickly grew two more touchdowns in the third quarter as Boise State was incapable of mounting any sort of comeback.

Cougars QB Zach Wilson threw for 359 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for another while RB Tyler Allgeier went over 100 yards thanks to an 86-yard TD run on BYU’s first possession of the game.

Boise State played three QBs

Boise State was forced to start backup QB Jack Sears in place of Hank Bachmeier for the second consecutive game. Sears then had to leave the game in the first half after a QB sneak.

Sears was hit in the head on the sneak and was noticeably unsteady enough that officials asked him to head to the sideline. He then went to the locker room and never returned to the game.

That forced Cade Fennegan — Boise State’s third-string QB — into action. And the offense struggled with him at QB. Coach Bryan Harsin inserted No. 4 QB Andy Peters into the game in the second half after BYU went up 31-3, though Fennegan later came back into the game.

The loss is the Broncos’ first defeat by 20 or more points at home since 2001 and the worst home loss since Boise State lost to Cal State Northridge to open the 1997 season. Boise State was an FCS school in the Big West Conference back then.

BYU’s weak schedule

BYU had a schedule lined up that included six games against Power Five opponents and Boise State. But as top conferences went to conference-only schedules because of the coronavirus pandemic, BYU was forced to cobble together a schedule that was considerably weaker than it was expecting to have.

That could be detrimental later in the season. Boise State was BYU’s best opponent remaining and, well, the Broncos didn’t put up much of a fight. Yeah, Boise was shorthanded at QB, but the Cougar offense didn’t have much trouble with the Boise State defense either.

You can look at it the other way too, of course. If BYU was that much better than a ranked opponent — no matter the conference — then BYU is a legitimate top-10 team, right?

Well, the rankings are a little discombobulated this year with the Big Ten starting its third week of play and the Pac-12 getting underway this weekend. While BYU is clearly one of the better teams in the country, it’s hard to get a true sense of how great the Cougars are.

That’s important when it comes to the New Year’s Six race. Since it’s an independent, BYU is only eligible for an at-large selection to a New Year’s Six bowl and not the top spot awarded to teams outside the Power Five conferences. How does BYU stack up against teams from the SEC and Big Ten?

On record, it’s not that close. BYU only has games against North Alabama and San Diego State remaining. Anything worse than 9-1 will be a disaster. Will 10-0 be good enough for a New Year’s Six bowl? It should be. But given the Cougars’ schedule, it’s not a guarantee just yet.

Raiders owner Mark Davis says NFL's punishment for repeated COVID-19 violations is 'draconian',['Jack Baer'],"In a season full of times the NFL has come down hard on teams violating its COVID-19 safety protocols, the league dropped its biggest hammer so far this year on the Las Vegas Raiders.

The NFL has fined the Raiders $500,000 and head coach Jon Gruden $150,000 for “repeat offenses” against the protocols, according to Yahoo Sports’ Charles Robinson. Las Vegas will also lose a 2021 sixth-round pick.

You won’t be surprised to hear that Raiders owner Mark Davis is not a fan of that news and plans to appeal the penalties.

From ESPN:

“The fines are draconian,” Davis told ESPN on Friday. “But we will appeal them. Outside the organization, people have the wrong impression about the Raiders. We take it seriously. It’s unfortunate that certain things outside the protocol are the things being focused on, rather than the positive steps we've taken as an organization. You’ve been in the building. You’ve seen it.”

Thursday’s fines bring the Raiders’ total this year to $800,000, $1.05 million if you add Gruden’s total and $1.21 million if you add player fines. The violations stem from offensive lineman Trent Brown landing on the reserve/COVID list in late October, a non-credentialed employee being allowed into the team’s locker room after a game in Week 2 and a fine for Gruden failing to wear a mask properly during that same game. Ten more players were fined $165,000 total for failing to adhere to COVID-19 protocols at a charity event in late September.

If the Raiders’ offenses continue, they can expect that total to climb even quicker.

"Report: Five members of Dodgers organization test positive for COVID-19, but none were in MLB bubble",['Jack Baer'],"Five members of the Los Angeles Dodgers organization plus a family member have tested positive for COVID-19, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health via the Los Angeles Times.

The identities of the six people are unclear, though the Times reports that none of the tests came from employees inside MLB’s “bubble” at the World Series in Texas.

The positive tests come 10 days after the Dodgers’ World Series win and the COVID-19 controversy that erupted following the end of the series, in which Justin Turner joined his teammates on the field at Globe Life Field after testing positive for COVID-19 during Game 6.

Justin Turner avoided punishment for breaking COVID-19 quarantine

Major League Baseball announced Friday that it would not punish Turner for his conduct following the World Series, despite releasing a scathing statement criticizing his actions the day after the game.

Turner apologized for breaking quarantine and running onto the field in an accompanying statement. He claimed he had been under the impression that few people were left on the field when he went out to take a photograph and was under the impression that Dodgers officials did not object to his coming out. Turner conceded he should have waited before taking the field.

MLB commissioner Rob Manfred essentially corroborated Turner’s account, saying MLB could have handled the situation more effectively. He said the league should have had a security staff member monitor Turner and Turner should have been promptly transported to the team hotel for isolation.

Whoever’s fault it was, the unfortunate reality was that Turner and his wife ended up on a field embracing multiple teammates and potentially exposing them to the virus. At one point, Turner took his mask off, and also ended up front and center in a team photo.

Dodgers who were in close contact with Turner were later ordered to quarantine by Los Angeles County.

However, it seems quite unlikely these new positive tests can actually be traced to Turner.

These positive tests probably weren’t caused by Justin Turner

As the Times reports, none of the six tests came from people who were in the MLB bubble (which some players have criticized for not actually being a bubble). Given that players, coaching staffs and their families were all in the bubble, that means the people who tested positive probably wouldn’t have been with Turner on the field.

Maybe there’s another way the virus could have spread through the organization beyond the field, but odds are we won’t be finding out.

Bob Ley slams ESPN after network announces largest layoffs ever,['Ryan Young'],"ESPN announced the biggest layoffs the company has ever had on Thursday, and longtime journalist Bob Ley was not happy about it.

Ley — the former anchor and “Outside The Lines” host who had been with ESPN essentially since the beginning — slammed the network on Twitter.

Trying to remain objective and unemotional as I learn of the @espn team members laid off today. Not possible. Not as I see countless decades of journalistic experience, and expertise jettisoned. Just when we need it most. Enjoy the DIS stock price and your NFL football. — Bob Ley (@BobLeyESPN) November 5, 2020

“Trying to remain objective and unemotional as I learn of the ESPN team members laid off today. Not possible,” Ley wrote. “Not as I see countless decades of journalist experience, and expertise jettisoned. Just when we need it most. “Enjoy the [Disney] stock price and your NFL football.”

ESPN cuts 500 total jobs in largest layoff ever

ESPN, according to an internal memo obtained by Front Office Sports’ Michael McCarthy, cut 300 jobs on Thursday and opted to eliminate 200 open positions at the company.

Disney, ESPN’s parent company, announced in September that it was cutting about 25 percent of its workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro said the company had reached its limit during the “COVID storm” and had to make a move.

“Prior to the pandemic, we had been deeply engaged in strategizing how best to position ESPN for future success amidst tremendous disruption in how fans consume sports. The pandemic’s significant impact on our business clearly accelerated those forward-looking discussions. In the short term, we enacted various steps like executive and talent salary reductions, furloughs, and budget cuts, and we implemented innovative operations and production approaches, all in an effort to weather the COVID storm. We have, however, reached an inflection point,” Pitaro wrote in the memo, via Front Office Sports. “The speed at which change is occurring requires great urgency, and we must now deliver on serving sports fans in a myriad of new ways. Placing resources in support of our direct-to-consumer business strategy, digital, and, of course, continued innovative television experiences, is more critical than ever.”

It’s unclear who all was impacted by the layoffs, but former college football writer Ivan Maisel, NHL staff writer Chris Peters, MLB writer Claire Smith and staff writer Emily Rand were among those who announced they had lost their jobs on social media.

As he’s retired, Ley is in a unique position to call out his former employer for the move on social media. When ESPN announced a round of layoffs in 2017 while he was still working there, Ley honored his former co-workers in a segment on air.

Now, though, he’s not holding back.

Kaepernick's protest and influence,['Yahoo Sports Staff'],"Nearly four years ago Colin Kaepernick began sitting and later kneeling during the national anthem before NFL games.

“I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick said in 2016. “To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”

Kaepernick’s protest rocked the league. The country too. Kneeling became a regular issue for then-candidate Donald Trump to use on the presidential campaign trail. He found plenty of support, since the anthem and the flag remain cherished by many. He relentlessly blasted the players (“son of a bitch!”) and the NFL itself (“total disrespect for our great country!”) to thunderous applause among supporters.

Biden delivers confident assessment: ‘We’re going to win this race’,"['Brittany Shepherd', 'David Knowles']","Democratic nominee Joe Biden addressed the nation Friday, after his growing lead in the presidential election’s key battleground states appeared to have placed him on the verge of victory.

""The numbers tell us a clear and convincing story: We're going to win this race,"" Biden said in remarks delivered from inside the Chase Center in Wilmington, Del.

Biden’s speech had a touch of an anticlimactic feel. When it was scheduled earlier in the day, speculation mounted that it could become a victory speech and might follow a potential race call by the Associated Press or major media outlets. But at the time he spoke, the race remained too close to call.

The former vice president nevertheless took the opportunity to project confidence in the ultimate outcome of the contest.

""What is becoming clearer each hour is that record numbers of Americans, from all races, faiths, regions, chose change over more of the same,” he said.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Biden’s running mate, was reportedly expected to join him in the announcement. But although she joined him onstage, she did not speak, and Biden kept his remarks short.

Early Friday morning, Biden overcame Trump’s lead in two key states — Pennsylvania and Georgia — as more results from early and mail-in ballots were added to the totals. In the absence of a final call, which could come within hours, Biden noted that he had fulfilled his campaign promise to rebuild the Democratic firewall in the states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, which Trump had won in 2016.

“We've rebuilt the Blue Wall across this country that crumbled just four years ago,” Biden said in reference to his wins in those three states.

The remarks came as the race appeared to be quickly slipping away from Trump. As votes continued to be counted in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania, Biden held a lead in all of them. The Associated Press and Fox had already called Arizona for Biden; any of the remaining three states would put the Democrat over the 270 Electoral College votes needed to secure the presidency. (Other media outlets have yet to call Arizona.)

But ahead of Biden’s speech in Wilmington, President Trump made clear that he would not be conceding defeat in the race anytime soon.

“Joe Biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the President!” Trump tweeted. “I could make that claim also. Legal proceedings are just now beginning!”

Early on Wednesday, several hours after the polls closed, Trump made an appearance and declared he had already won the election.

""We will win this, and as far as I'm concerned, we already have,” he told supporters in the East Room of the White House.

On Thursday, Trump repeated that claim and baselessly alleged a conspiracy between Democrats, the media, pollsters and state election officials to keep him from being reelected.

“Our numbers started miraculously getting whittled away, in secret,” he said, without providing any evidence to back up that explosive assertion. “This is a case where they’re trying to steal an election. They’re trying to rig an election. And we can’t let that happen.”

Trump’s speech drew sharp rebukes from Republicans and Democrats alike, many of whom accused him of undermining the trust of the American public in the institution of voting.

On Friday afternoon, Trump released a statement that was far more restrained than the one he read to reporters Thursday.

“We believe the American people deserve to have full transparency into all vote counting and election certification, and that this is no longer about any single election,” he said in the statement. “This is about the integrity of our entire election process. From the beginning we have said that all legal ballots must be counted and all illegal ballots should not be counted, yet we have met resistance to this basic principle by Democrats at every turn. We will pursue this process through every aspect of the law to guarantee that the American people have confidence in our government. I will never give up fighting for you and our nation.”

On Friday, Biden made it clear that he would not sit by idly while Trump mounted an attempt to keep him from the White House.

“Democracy works. Your vote will be counted. I don’t care who tries to stop it, I will not let it happen,” Biden said. “The people will be heard. Our journey is towards a more perfect union, and we keep moving on.”

McConnell says big stimulus bill not needed after better-than-expected jobs report,[],"After saying a stimulus bill would be the focus when the Senate returns, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is now suggesting that a small package may be enough given the pace of the economic recovery.

“Our economy is really moving to get back on its feet. That I think clearly ought to affect what size of any rescue package we additionally do,” McConnell told reporters in Kentucky on Friday. “Something smaller, rather than throwing another $3 trillion at this issue, is more appropriate.”

After the October jobs report beat estimates, with the addition of 638,000 jobs and an unemployment rate down to 6.9%, McConnell said this “is a stunning indication of a dramatic comeback of the economy,” paired with the surge in GDP in the third quarter.

Still, the economic recovery is slowing down. More than 10 million jobs have yet to be recovered and 21 million Americans still rely on some type of unemployment benefits, some of which expire at the end of the year.

‘It doesn’t appeal to me at all’

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) latest stimulus offer came down to $2.2 trillion, which opens a big gap between the Democratic proposal and the proposals McConnell has brought to the floor, the latest of which was $500 billion.

“No, it doesn’t appeal to me at all because they still have not agreed to crush the virus,” Pelosi told reporters on Friday when asked about a smaller bill. “That isn’t anything that we should even be looking at.”

If he losses the election, President Donald Trump may also be less likely to push for a high price tag on a stimulus deal like he did before the election and will have no “political capital” to do so, according to Mark Harkins, a former congressional staffer and senior fellow at Georgetown’s Government Affairs Institute.

“It truly is up to the Senate leadership to determine whether they want to work a deal or not and whether the Democratic leadership wants to capitulate to a smaller number,” Harkins told Yahoo Money. “At the moment, it seems like neither sides are willing to give up.”

‘They become fiscal conservatives again’

While the White House’s counterproposal was worth “almost $1.9 trillion” in the week before the election, the Republican proposal may have a much lower price tag.

“We’re not interested in, you know, two or three trillion,” Larry Kudlow, director of the U.S. National Economic Council told reporters on Friday. “We would like to negotiate a package.”

But different analyses find that larger stimulus packages would lead to a faster economic recovery. A $2 stimulus package could bring the economy back on track to its pre-pandemic levels by mid-2021, an analysis by Brookings found.

Another analysis by Evercore ISI found that a package like the one Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Pelosi were negotiating — worth around $1.9 trillion — would have increased GDP by 3.5% in 2021 and returned the economy to its pre-pandemic path in the fourth quarter of next year.

“Republicans have supported additional funding in the past,” Harkins said. “But especially with a President Biden, they're going to find that they become fiscal conservatives again after four years of not caring quite as much.”

Deion Sanders lands his biggest commitment as Jackson State head coach: His son,['Jack Baer'],"Deion Sanders has landed his biggest recruit since becoming head coach at Jackson State, and it’s safe to say he had a bit of an inside track on this one.

Shedeur Sanders, son of the NFL Hall of Famer, announced Friday that he is flipping his commitment from Florida Atlantic to play for his father.

I couldn’t pass up a opportunity to help level the playing field & pursue equality for HBCU”s ! Dad I got your back! JSU #theeilove 🐅 COMMITTED @DeionSanders @PilarSanders @Striving4_ALott @DemetricDWarren pic.twitter.com/DvN7JFxyyv — Shedeur Sanders (@ShedeurSanders) November 6, 2020

According to Rivals, the younger Sanders is a three-star quarterback out of Trinity Christian School in Texas, where his father had previously worked as offensive coordinator. Among the schools that reportedly offered Sanders a scholarship are Alabama, Michigan, LSU, Penn State, Florida and his father’s alma mater, Florida State.

In three seasons at Trinity Christian, Sanders has compiled 8,796 passing yards, 123 touchdowns and 19 interceptions, per The Dallas Morning News. More importantly, he has won three state championships.

Deion Sanders keeps winning on recruiting trail

Deion Sanders’ recruiting success hasn’t been limited to prospects he has both fathered and coached in high school.

Since taking the Jackson State job in September, Sanders has also won the commitments of three-star defensive tackle Braezhon Ross and two-star cornerback Herman Smith. That might not sound like much to most Power 5 fans, but it’s big for a HBCU playing in the FCS.

Sanders’ name recognition has been a boon for Jackson State in many respects, especially marketing. All that’s left is to prove his effectiveness on the sideline when the Tigers can start playing games again.

"Bebe Rexha shows off body in one piece after paparazzi photos surface: ‘I got stretch marks, I got cellulite’",[],"Bebe Rexha is showing followers her unfiltered bikini body while claiming that paparazzi photos of her taken on the beach were unflattering.

The 31-year-old singer took to her Instagram where she has 10.5 million followers on Thursday night to record herself in a one-piece bathing suit days after photos were posted by the DailyMail of her in the same suit. “I went to Mexico with my boyfriend and paparazzi posted some pictures of me,” she said. “And I wanted to show you what I really look like.”

The singer shared videos of herself in a swimsuit to show off her unfiltered body. (Photo: Instagram)

Rexha has spoken out about struggling with body image in the past and even opened up about designers denying to dress her for certain red carpets because of her size. In her latest Instagram story she says, “I got thighs and I got a**.” Still, she admits that her self confidence can take a hit when photos of herself pop up on the internet.

“I find it hard to love myself sometimes. And when you see yourself looking like s***, it's like, yes, I got stretch marks, let me show you. I got stretch marks, I got cellulite, all of the above,” she said with the camera angled to show her body. “But I don’t do surgery. I’ve never touched my body, never done lipo[suction], never done any of that stuff. I’m trying to be healthy and respect what God gave me. And I like to eat and I also take medicine that makes it really hard for me to lose weight.”

The Jealous singer went on to say that her body has been the same since she was a young girl, calling herself “thick” and pointing out her small waist. When showing off the latest paparazzi photos, she said “what the hell. ...That’s not what I look like.”

This isn’t the first time that she’s spoken out about plastic surgery after debunking rumors that she’d had work done during a 2019 interview with Health. In her Instagram story she said, “That’s how I was born.”

"Pennsylvania Republicans leaders dismiss Trump fraud claims, but call for audit",['Benjamin Siegel'],"Pennsylvania Republican leaders on Friday did not join President Donald Trump and his close allies in accusing the state’s election officials of fraud, but did step forward to call for an audit of the election.

Two leaders of the Republican-controlled legislature said they had concerns about the conduct of Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar, a Democrat, who they say overstepped her role by issuing a series of last-minute instructions that revised election rules. Soon after, Boockvar ordered an audit.

""I have no knowledge of any voter fraud and I have no knowledge of any misdeeds, other than the process [by] which the Department of State ran in this election,"" Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman, told reporters on a Zoom call about concerns with the administration of the election.

Pennsylvania House Speaker Bryan Cutler said only an audit would enable ""Pennsylvanians and the rest of the world [to] have faith in our election process.""

The lawmakers' chief concern, as other Republicans expressed in court, has been a series of accommodations Boockvar granted in the days before the election. On her guidance, some counties took steps to help voters fix ballots that had been submitted with errors -- a process called curing. Not all counties acted on her instructions, leading to ""disparate"" treatment of voters, they said.

Boockvar announced plans Friday afternoon for an audit, similar to the one conducted after the state's June primary.

The secretary of state has been at odds with GOP leaders for having failed to reach an agreement with the state’s Democratic governor to allow election officials to start processing ballots ahead of Election Day, as many other states did to speed up their vote counts.

""They don't like the late counting of ballots because they don't like anything that allows more eligible voters to be enfranchised,"" she said.

Anderson Cooper Stuns Viewers With Brutal Take On Trump's Latest Election Remarks,[],"CNN’s Anderson Cooper shocked viewers on Thursday with a particularly vicious take after President Donald Trump railed against the legitimacy of the democratic process, spread conspiracy theories and claimed victory despite still-uncertain election results in a remarkably dishonest speech to media.

“That is the president of the United States. That is the most powerful person in the world, and we see him like an obese turtle on his back flailing in the hot sun, realizing his time is over,” Cooper said following Trump’s Thursday evening press conference.

“He just hasn’t accepted it and he wants to take everybody down with him, including this country.”

Trump claimed during his address that “if you count the legal votes, I easily win” — falsely suggesting that the votes being counted now are illegal, which they are not. He added, without evidence, that the vote had been marred by historic election interference from “big media, big money and Big Tech.”

With his chance of reelection diminishing as critical swing states continue to tally votes, Trump has initiated legal challenges to disqualify or stop the counting of legitimately cast ballots. He has claimed baselessly that Democrats are trying to steal the election and falsely declared himself winner of several states where vote counts are not finished.

Cooper’s controversial remarks lit up social media. Some people called out the anchor for ableism and fat-shaming by referring to Trump’s weight. Others praised him for denouncing the president. Many were simply baffled that this is what it’s come to.

Anderson Cooper compares Trump to an 'obese turtle' following White House press conference,"['George Back', 'Producer', 'Yahoo Entertainment']","Following President Trump’s press conference Thursday evening, CNN’s election panel weighed in on his unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud. President Trump made multiple accusations about illegal votes and mail-in voter fraud, saying, “This is a case where they’re trying to steal an election — trying to rig an election.” Everyone on the panel condemned the president’s speech, but host Anderson Cooper’s rebuke was perhaps the most harsh.

“That is the president of the United States,” said Cooper. “That is the most powerful person in the world and we see him like an obese turtle on his back, flailing in the hot sun, realizing his time is over but he just hasn't accepted it and he wants to take everybody down with him, including this country.”

Republican and former Pennsylvania senator, Rick Santorum, was unable to defend the president’s statement. In fact, he said, “No Republican elected official will stand behind that statement. None of them will.”

“Much of that statement was not factual and was at times incendiary and not something that a president of the United States should say,” said Santorum. “For the president to go out there and claim that without any evidence of that is dangerous.”

“There is nothing more sacred than this institution, and he is willing to subjugate the institutions of our democracy to his own personal interest and that has been true from the beginning, Axelrod said. “This is just the latest and the saddest chapter, and it's increasingly looking like the last one.”

Numerous news stations cut away from the remarks of President Donald Trump Thursday as he told multiple falsehoods about the 2020 presidential election being “stolen” from him.

Both Fox News and CNN broadcast the entire message, and when it ended, CNN mainstay Anderson Cooper expressed his dismay in a scorching on-air takedown.

He continued to allege, as he has for months, that there is a larger Democratic conspiracy to steal the election from him.

However, media outlets, governors, and secretaries of states continue to insist that the high-rate of mail-in ballots are the reason that former Vice President Joe Biden appears to be on the cusp of victory.

After months of the president’s discounting of the validity of mail-in voting, those historic ballots have skewed largely Democratic, resulting in the flipping of a number of states including Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia.

'Fox & Friends' Says Trump Should Leave Twitter And Take His Followers,[],"“Fox & Friends,” President Donald Trump’s favorite TV show, gave him some bold advice on Thursday: Get off Twitter.

As the social media company has begun slapping warning labels on tweets containing falsehoods or inciting violence, co-hosts Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade ― along with guest Matt Walsh of Daily Wire ― complained Trump was being unfairly censored.

After Walsh griped that he, too, was being censored, Kilmeade started wondering. “Why do you patronize a big-tech company like this when they continue to show a lack of respect for you?” he asked. “The president should start. If the president takes his followers and goes somewhere else, that will be a tweetstorm.”

Trump, who has made tweeting to his 88 million followers a centerpiece of his presidency, has increasingly been thwarted by the social media company for posting disinformation and falsehoods. Twitter, accused of being a breeding ground for conspiracy theories, has begun flagging tweets by Trump and his supporters with warnings for misinformation or inciting violence.

In the “Fox & Friends” discussion with Walsh, the hosts showed a censored Walsh tweet questioning the unfinished vote counting.

Walsh said Twitter is “editorializing,” becoming less of a platform and more of a publisher, and said this sort of censoring has also been happening to Trump.

Kilmeade pushed further, suggesting Walsh’s tweet wouldn’t have been flagged if it had been about Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Walsh added that Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who spoke out against Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court nomination weren’t censored.

“Those people aren’t being shut down on Twitter the way that I have been, the way the president has been,” said Walsh.

Walsh complained that tech titans like Facebook and Twitter dominate social media, “so we have to contend with that.”

Earhardt chimed in that some people are switching to Parler, which The Washington Post has described as a Twitter clone for conservatives.

In Phoenix on Wednesday night, some of Trump’s supporters turned on Fox News, unhappy that the network called the outcome of the election in Arizona for Biden.

“Fox News sucks,” they chanted.

Hillsong Church Pastor Carl Lentz Was Fired: Here’s Everything We Know About the Scandal,[],"Hillsong Church pastor Carl Lentz, who rose to public prominence thanks to A-list celebrity churchgoers like Justin Bieber, has been terminated from his position.

Pastor Carl, as he is often referred to, was the leader of Hillsong NYC, the East Coast branch of the popular mega-church. Founder Brian Houston announced the news on Wednesday, November 5.

“Today Hillsong Church East Coast advised our congregation that we have terminated the employment of Pastor Carl Lentz,” he said in a statement, per People. “This action was not taken lightly and was done in the best interests of everyone, including Pastor Carl.” The reason? “Ongoing discussions in relation to leadership issues and breaches of trust, plus a recent revelation of moral failures.” Houston did not go into detail about what those “moral failures” are, exactly.

“While I have no doubt that this is the right course of action, I must mention Bobbie’s and my personal sadness, as we have known Laura [Lentz’s wife] her entire life and Carl for well over 20 years,” Houston continued. “We thank Pastors Carl and Laura for the way they have served faithfully and sacrificially since the start of Hillsong NYC and for contributing so significantly to the countless lives that have been transformed for Jesus Christ through this ministry. They have a heart for people and we are confident that after a time of rest and restoration, God will use Carl in another way outside of Hillsong Church. In terminating his tenure, we in no way want to diminish the good work he did here.”

In case you’re not super familiar with Hillsong, here’s everything you need to know.

What is Hillsong, exactly?

Hillsong was originally founded in Sydney, Australia, in 1983 by Brian and Bobbie Houston but now exists in 28 countries and, according to its website, has an average global attendance of 150,000 people per week.

Story continues

“Hillsong is a church that believes in Jesus, a church that loves God and people,” the site also reads. Their mission statement reads, “To reach and influence the world by building a large Christ-centered, Bible-based church, changing mindsets and empowering people to lead and impact in every sphere of life.”

Hillsong church services are known for their music and almost concert-like atmosphere. They’ve even produced and released multiple albums over the years.

Which celebrities have attended Hillsong services in the past?

Justin and Hailey Bieber, Vanessa Hudgens, Chris Pratt, Nick Jonas, Selena Gomez, Kylie and Kendall Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian, NBA superstar Kevin Durant, and Bono have all reportedly gone to services at the church, per People, though that’s not to say they are all official members of the congregation.

“People say we cater to celebrities,” Pastor Carl told GQ in 2015. “And I say, Yes, we do. Celebrities deserve a relationship with God. Celebrities deserve a place to pray.”

What’s the deal with Justin Bieber and Pastor Carl Lentz?

The singer and Pastor Carl were once very close. At one point in 2014, Bieber moved in with Lentz and his family (which is discussed in the GQ profile as well). “This boy is 21. He’s in a horribly toxic world,” Lentz told the magazine at the time. “He is trying to do his best to figure this out. He has never been anybody but who he has professed to be, which is a work in progress.”

Bieber was baptized by Lentz in NBA player Tyson Chandler’s bathtub in the middle of the night (true story!), and the pastor was his close spiritual advisor. He also reportedly counseled Bieber and ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez during their relationship. “They don’t want to repeat the same patterns as before,” a source told People in 2017. “They’ve clearly had issues in the past, so they’re receiving some guidance from Carl.”

In 2018, TMZ reported that Bieber and Lentz had a falling out, though they said he and now wife Hailey were still attending Hillsong at the time. Bieber has not commented on the termination of Lentz from Hillsong.

How does Carl Lentz feel about leaving?

Lentz broke his silence on the news Thursday afternoon, November 5. Read his full statement, below:

“Our time at HillsongNYC has come to an end. This is a hard ending to what has been the most amazing, impacting, and special chapter of our lives. Leading this church has been an honor in every sense of the word, and it is impossible to articulate how much we have loved and will always love the amazing people in this church. When you accept the calling of being a pastor, you must live in such a way that it honors the mandate. That it honors the church, and that it honors God. When that does not happen, a change needs to be made and has been made in this case to ensure that standard is upheld. Laura and I and our amazing children have given all that we have to serve and build this church, and over the years I did not do an adequate job of protecting my own spirit, refilling my own soul, and reaching out for the readily available help that is available. When you lead out of an empty place, you make choices that have real and painful consequences.

“I was unfaithful in my marriage, the most important relationship in my life, and held accountable for that. This failure is on me, and me alone, and I take full responsibility for my actions. I now begin a journey of rebuilding trust with my wife, Laura, and my children and taking real time to work on and heal my own life and seek out the help that I need. I am deeply sorry for breaking the trust of many people who we have loved serving and understand that this news can be very hard and confusing for people to hear and process. I would have liked to say this with my voice, to you, in person because you are owed that. But that opportunity I will not have. So to those people, I pray you can forgive me and that over time I can live a life where trust is earned again. To our pastors Brian and Bobbie, thank you for allowing us to lead, allowing us to thrive and giving us room to have a voice that you have never stifled or tried to silence. Thank you for your grace and kindness especially in this season, as you have done so much to protect and love us through this. We, the Lentz family, don’t know what this next chapter will look like, but we will walk into it together very hopeful and grateful for the grace of God.”

Celebrity Pastor Fired From Church Confesses He Was Unfaithful To Wife,[],"An evangelical Christian pastor known for being a spiritual mentor to the stars has been fired from his job leading a popular New York City church.

Pastor Carl Lentz was terminated from Hillsong Church East Coast, based in New York City, Hillsong’s global senior pastor, Brian Houston, announced in a statement Wednesday.

The 41-year-old preacher was fired following “ongoing discussions” about “leadership issues and breaches of trust, plus a recent revelation of moral failures,” Houston said.

In an Instagram post Thursday, Lentz admitted that he had been “unfaithful in [his] marriage, the most important relationship in my life and held accountable for that.”

“This failure is on me, and me alone and I take full responsibility for my actions,” he wrote. “I now begin a journey of rebuilding trust with my wife, Laura and my children and taking real time to work on and heal my own life and seek out the help that I need.”

Lentz and his wife Laura have been together for more than 18 years and have three children.

Lentz apologized for “breaking the trust” of people he’s served.

“I pray you can forgive me and that over time I can live a life where trust is earned again,” he wrote.

Lentz also thanked Houston and his wife for doing “so much to protect and love us through this.”

Houston, an Australian pastor who founded Hillsong in Sydney in 1983, said the termination is not meant to diminish the “good work” Lentz and his wife had done for Hillsong. Houston said he is confident that Carl Lentz will return to some form of ministry outside of Hillsong “after a time of rest and restoration.”

Hillsong East Coast’s services will continue “as usual” while the church selects new leadership, Houston said.

“This action was not taken lightly and was done in the best interests of everyone, including Pastor Carl,” Houston wrote in his statement.

Hillsong did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

Carl Lentz earned a reputation for being a celebrity pastor, part of a league of preachers giving American evangelicalism a fresh feel while keeping its conservative theology on culture war issues intact. These pastors eschew stodgy church attire for fashionable clothes and footwear, preside over services that seem like pop concerts, maintain popular social media accounts and attract celebrity followers.

Lentz developed close friendships with Justin Bieber and his wife, Hailey Baldwin Bieber, as well as with Kylie and Kendall Jenner, according to a 2017 GQ story. Bieber briefly moved in with Lentz and his family in 2014 and was later baptized by Lentz in NBA player Tyson Chandler’s bathtub, according to a GQ profile.

Lentz and his wife ― and several other celebrity evangelical preachers ― attended the Biebers’ wedding. Justin and Hailey Bieber still make appearances in Lentz and his wife’s Instagram feeds.

Lentz, originally from Virginia, trained at the church-affiliated Hillsong College in Australia, which is where he met his wife, according to Religion News Service. Lentz started what would become Hillsong East Coast with Houston’s son Joel in 2010. Hillsong’s services in a New York City theater are known for drawing long lines primarily of young people ― some of whom stand for the duration of the services.

Lentz has been outspoken over the past few years acknowledging police brutality against Black Americans. That set him apart from other members of his religious group: Most white evangelicals (72%) don’t believe that police killings of Black men are part of a larger pattern of how police treat African Americans. At the same time, Lentz has been careful not to imply that by saying Black Lives Matter he supports the official Black Lives Matter movement.

In a September Instagram post, Lentz insisted that the phrase “Black Lives Matter” is not “owned by any particular group or organization.” It is a “perfectly reasonable and logical to say, no matter how many people try to convince you that somehow saying this sentence makes you a marxist endorsing, anti police, left leaning liberal loving, demonically powered and politically motivated activist pseudo warrior,” Lentz wrote. “It does not.”

Hillsong has churches in 28 cities around the world, with a global weekly attendance of 150,000. Its music ministry is even more popular: Hillsong’s worship bands frequently set trends in the Christian contemporary music industry, and its songs are sung by millions of people around the globe every Sunday.

Carl Lentz, a former spiritual advisor of Justin’s, was fired from Hillsong’s New York City location because of “breaches of trust” and “moral failures.” Lentz, 41, spoke out on Thursday and admitted he was unfaithful to his wife.

“This failure is on me, and me alone and I take full responsibility for my actions,” Lentz wrote in a lengthy Instagram post. “I now begin a journey of rebuilding trust with my wife, Laura and my children and taking real time to work on and heal my own life and seek out the help that I need.”

Hillsong, an Australia-based church, has been something of a pop culture namesake due to its famous friends and congregants.

Here’s what you need to know.

What happened?

On Wednesday, Hillsong founding pastor Brian Houston announced “that we have terminated the employment of Pastor Carl Lentz.”

“This action was not taken lightly and was done in the best interests of everyone, including Pastor Carl,” the statement read. “We thank Pastors Carl and Laura for the way they have served faithfully and sacrificially since the start of Hillsong NYC and for contributing so significantly to the countless lives that have been transformed for Jesus Christ through this ministry. They have a heart for people and we are confident that after a time of rest and restoration, God will use Carl in another way outside of Hillsong church. In terminating his tenure, we in no way want to diminish the good work he did here.

“This action has been taken following ongoing discussions in relation to leadership issues and breaches of trust, plus a recent revelation of moral failures,” the statement continued. “It would not be appropriate for us to go into detail about the events that led to this decision. Our focus at this time is to honor God and pastorally care for our East Coast church community as well as the Lentz family.”

Houston concluded by noting that Hillsong will not be making further public comments on this matter.

Who is Pastor Carl?

Known as a “styled-up pastor to the stars,” according to a GQ profile, Lentz and Houston’s son, Joel, began Hillsong NYC in 2010. Justin became the congregation’s most famous face as he previously credited Lentz with helping turn his life around.

In 2014 amid a string of negative headlines, Justin moved in with Lentz during what he called his personal low point. The singer explained to Vogue last year that he abused Xanax and was “being super-promiscuous” before detoxing at the pastor’s home in New Jersey. There, Justin refocused on his religious faith and said he has not ingested a drug since. Lentz even baptized Justin in NBA star Tyson Chandler’s bathtub.

“This boy is 21. He’s in a horribly toxic world,” Lentz told GQ in 2015. “He is trying to do his best to figure this out. He has never been anybody but who he has professed to be, which is a work in progress.”

Lentz reportedly helped counsel Justin and Gomez during their on-again, off-again relationship. According to People, the pastor guided them in 2017 so they wouldn’t “repeat the same patterns as before.” The singers ultimately ended their relationship and Justin proposed to Hailey Bieber (née Baldwin) months later. Around the same time, TMZ reported there was a “major falling out” between Justin and Lentz.

Hailey has been a prominent member of the Hillsong community, speaking glowingly about the church during a conversation with Miley Cyrus.

Understandably, most of our post-Election Day attention has been focused on the still-undecided presidential race (and specifically to the ongoing vote-counts in Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Nevada), but there are plenty of other races that have already been decided — with very concerning results. Regardless of who steps into the Oval Office, the president will have a hard time setting any agenda with a hostile Congress. That’s why Democrats hoped that a Biden election would coincide with a so-called “blue wave,” increasing the Democrat majority in the House, and turning the Senate blue. But, that didn’t happen.

As of Wednesday night, the Senate map is at an even tie: 48 Republicans and 48 Democrats have won seats, and four races are yet to be called. Of those races, Republican senators are ahead in North Carolina and Alaska, and the races for both Republican-held seats in Georgia are neck and neck. “I was hoping that we would sweep to victory with a number of Senate wins,” Democratic Sen.-elect John Hickenlooper, who unseated Republican Sen. Cory Gardner in Colorado, said on MSNBC. “We’re still cautiously optimistic, but it’s not the level of excitement I was hoping to wake up to.”

Story continues

With their candidates showing leads in those races, the Republican party’s hopes of retaining control of the Senate and creating a wall of resistance against the potential Biden administration appear within reach.

So then, what happens if Joe Biden wins the presidency and has to lead a Republican-majority or evenly split Senate? Not much, probably — in the worst possible way. If the Senate maintains a Republican majority, Biden would be the first Democratic president since Grover Cleveland in 1885 to begin his presidency without Democratic control in the House and the Senate, reports the Los Angeles Times. This will make it incredibly hard to pass legislation, because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will still be in a position of extraordinary power to determine the success of the Biden administration.

What can Democrats do? Not much for at least two years, when voters will have another opportunity to vote in Senate races. In the meantime, we’ve seen what happens when branches of government are so divided that little — if any — progress is made, leaving voters to wonder whether politicians care more about representing the voices of their constituents or promoting their own egos. Coronavirus pandemic relief is a prime example. Proposals are bounced back and forth with small concessions, inflammatory statements, and performative pearl-clutching with no meaningful progress being made.

But as people suffer at the hands of a divided and indecisive government, many politicians are more concerned with relief being on their terms — even if relief was desperately needed months ago. With so many things in urgent need of addressing, the prospect of this divide across the branches of government resembles more of a ravine than a crack.

To further complicate things, Democrats have lost some of their influence in the House, with some truly fringe right-wingers having won elections this year. After receiving an excited endorsement from Trump himself, Marjorie Taylor Green – a candidate who openly promotes QAnon conspiracy theories – won a House seat in Georgia’s 14th district. Madison Cawthorn, who once said seeing Adolf Hitler’s vacation home in Germany was on his bucket list, is now the youngest Republican to ever be elected to Congress. He has also faced accusations of racism and sexual misconduct.

Despite all this, there is still reason to be hopeful: Republicans didn’t, after all, take back the House, and there’s still a chance that the Senate might end up as a 50/50 split, which would give tie-breaking power to the Vice-President, who — pending a Democratic win for the presidency — is going to be none other than Kamala Harris. And that’s something to feel good about.

Now if we could just get all those votes counted, we could finally breathe a sigh of relief.

Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?

"Glut of pheasants caused by lockdown shooting ban could threaten songbirds, warn conservationists",['Helena Horton'],"The pheasants released into the wild will not be shot until lockdown ends - Owen Humphreys/PA Wire

A glut of pheasants caused by the lockdown shooting ban could impact songbird populations, the RSPB has warned.

Countryside organisations have spoken out after the government ruled that hunting and most shooting is unable to continue over the lockdown period.

This is because people cannot meet in groups of more than two, or stay overnight to take part in recreational activity, meaning most shoots will be unviable.

Tim Bonner, the Chief Executive of the Countryside Alliance, said that woods will be full of the birds as they are unable to be shot.

He said there would be ""woods full of pheasants released and acclimatised to the wild which will have to be fed and protected until December while every shoot day has to be cancelled. The pinnacle of a year’s work brought to a sudden and complete halt. Their colleagues in Wales and Scotland have been wrestling with their own lockdowns and restrictions, but this is the most serious blow to the countryside since we were released from the first lockdown in the summer.""

The countryside campaigner added that the lockdown would be a ""huntsman’s or gamekeeper’s worst nightmare"" because of the kennels full of dogs and woods full of unshot birds.

A Natural England commissioned review found that large, dense populations of pheasants can compete with songbirds for food, including seeds and insects.

An RSPB spokesperson confirmed to the Telegraph that it is likely heightened pressure will be put on native bird populations because shooters will be unable to reduce the pheasant populations.

Martin Harper, director for conservation at the RSPB said: “Every year around 60 million non-native pheasants and red-legged partridges are released into our countryside. This is twice the biomass of all UK’s native breeding birds.

“Last month, Defra acknowledged in their response to the legal challenge on releasing gamebirds on protected sites, the release of this huge quantity of gamebirds can have direct and indirect impacts on our environment. What’s more, the number released has been increasing.""

Story continues

He recommended the shooting industry spends lockdown improving the environment for Britain's birds, adding: “Sadly, because this is an unregulated activity we do not have a baseline against which we can compare the impact of the forced end to this year’s shooting season. That said, a pause buys time for both the shooting industry to massively improve environmental standards and for governments across the UK to get a better understanding of the impact that gamebird shooting is having on our countryside and end environmentally unsustainable forms of shooting.”

Last week, the government confirmed it would be putting in place a licensing system for pheasant releases close to Special Protected Areas, in order to mitigate the environmental damage reports have shown they cause in large numbers.

This was in response to a judicial review brought by BBC presenter Chris Packham's wildlife campaign group, and it is likely to affect around a quarter of shoots."
Georgia poll worker in hiding after false claims online,"['Kate Brumback', 'Jude Joffe-Block']","ATLANTA (AP) — With all eyes on Georgia’s razor-thin presidential vote margin, falsehoods are swirling on social media about supposed ballot counting irregularities there.

Among the most widely shared examples is a video that has racked up millions of views on Twitter. It claims to show a poll worker crumpling up an absentee ballot.

As it turns out, it shows no such thing. Richard Barron, the Fulton County elections director, said late Friday that the poll worker seen in the video was discarding paper instructions, not a ballot, which would have been much larger than the paper seen in the video.

Barron also said the worker was in hiding after being harassed online due to the false claims.

Here’s a look at the facts:

CLAIM: A video showing the ballot count in Fulton County, Georgia, shows fraud because a poll worker processing absentee ballots crumples one up.

THE FACTS: Election officials say the poll worker in the video did not crumple or discard a ballot.

“It’s been questioned whether the poll worker featured in the video was discarding one of those ballots. The answer is no, undeniably no,” Barron told reporters at a Friday evening news conference at the Fulton County elections warehouse in Atlanta. “At no time was the poll worker able to extract a ballot.”

The widely shared video shows Fulton County poll workers processing absentee ballots at Atlanta’s State Farm Arena on Nov. 3. The poll worker appears to gesture in an animated way, and then crumple up a small piece of paper.

It appears that someone took a video of a video that someone else had recorded in the arena and added narration from a male voice. It is not clear who shot the original footage that the tweeted video was based on.

“He has a fit about something. And then flips off a ballot, and then crumples it up,” the narrator says. “If that is not voter fraud I don’t know what is.”

David Shafer, the chairman of Georgia’s Republican Party, retweeted the video and wrote, “Lawyers for the Georgia Republican Party have demanded that the Fulton County Board of Elections investigate and explain what is happening in this video.”

Story continues

Barron said his review of the incident determined there was no way the poll worker in the video could have discarded a ballot.

The poll worker’s assignment was to use a cutting machine to open the outer envelopes and separate them from interior envelopes. “At no time was the worker able to extract the ballot,” reads a statement from Fulton County. “Ballot extraction only occurs with workers assigned to sorting duties.”

The statement explains that the piece of paper seen in the video is too small to be a ballot, which would have measured 8.5 by 19 inches.

Instead, Barron said it appeared the worker was discarding the list of instructions voters receive in their mailed ballots, which are 8 by 5 inches. “Due to the difference in sizes, it is clear that no ballot was damaged or discarded,” the statement reads.

On the question of why the worker appeared agitated in the video, the statement says he had explained his fingers were slightly injured due to a machine malfunction.

Barron told reporters that the worker was staying with friends because he no longer felt safe at home after social media users harassed him and released his personal information.

“He was one of the workers that we had who trained everyone how to use those cutting machines because he was very good at it, and he was the fastest one,” Barron told reporters.

“I expressed my sorrow that all of this has happened to him for wanting to be an election worker and doing nothing but a good job during that.”

"Harvard research: Impact of poverty begins in the womb, but it doesn't have to","['Beth Greenfield', 'Senior Editor']","Documentary produced by Kristyn Martin

The dangers of fetal exposure to alcohol, drugs and lead are widely known by now. But researchers have found increasing evidence of another potential threat to babies in utero: toxic stress. And, more specifically, the kind that’s churned up in a mother who’s struggling to make ends meet.

“People living in poverty are at much greater risk to experience toxic stress, because the causes of stress in their daily lives don’t go away easily — the stress of having a roof over your head, the stress of food, the stress of having bills to pay, the stress of not being able to get out of that hole,” says Jack Shonkoff, a Harvard University professor of pediatrics and director of Harvard’s Center on the Developing Child. The physiologic results of constant worry include elevated heart rate and blood pressure and the release of stress hormones into the bloodstream — where they can cross the placenta and affect the development of the fetal brain.

“When you are in the kind of stresses that come from not knowing where you’re going to be living or where your next meal is coming from, the severity of the stress can cause us to actually shut down certain aspects of the brain,” explains Elisabeth Babcock, president and CEO of Economic Mobility Pathways (EMPath), a Boston-based nonprofit that aims to end poverty through scientific research and direct support.

The stresses of poverty essentially handicap a baby for life literally before birth, according to a massive and growing body of research from over the past decade, causing the brain to react in ways that lead to riskier behavior — and to a higher likelihood of bad health, poor grades, lower earnings and prison time.

How, then, to level the playing field for babies being born into the disadvantage of poverty? Scientists think the answer is simpler than you might think.

“When we ask anybody’s grandmother about what you need, it’s just somebody to love you,” says Shonkoff, whose research is at the forefront of this new field. “What science says is you need someone who will create an environment that’s well-regulated and protective and predictable.” Whatever way you say it, the upshot is that “kids are developing and thriving.”

Story continues

That, in a nutshell, is the essence of a burgeoning field of research showing that the imprint of poverty and its toxic stressors can actually be reversed — just by making some radical shifts in prenatal care for poor moms, through programs that provide consistent, empathic one-on-one coaching with the mother while she is pregnant, and continuing through early childhood. “The right kinds of supports during pregnancy are ultimately the earliest intervention for ... increasing the likelihood that that next generation will do better,” Shonkoff says.

And that formula — of having one person caring for another — is one that experts believe could have a potentially huge impact on intergenerational poverty.

“What's been wonderful is that there’s just been this explosion of studies — and a convergence of behavioral sciences, social sciences and pure sciences coming at this [area of] study from different perspectives, but saying the same things,” Babcock says. “So, the information is powerful, and it's cascading in a way that you can barely stay on top of it.”

“It’s nothing less than transformational,” she adds.

The rush of findings is the focus of a new documentary from Yahoo News, “Baby Brain,” which takes viewers into the lives of America’s most vulnerable: single mothers living below the poverty line, from West Virginia to Alabama, where such prenatal support programs have been reversing the stress effects on developing brains — and have the scientific evidence to prove it.

New research published in the journal Pediatrics in November, was the most substantial of its kind — a study of Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP), a pioneering national early-intervention program serving first-time mothers and their children living in poverty. The article, which built on past findings including a previous 15-year NFP study as well as some studies from as far back as the 1980s and ’90s, measured youth cognitive development and academic performance, and the results were groundbreaking, finding that NFP significantly improved the cognitive functioning and academic performance of 18-year-olds born to such high-risk mothers.

An additional Pediatrics study over the same 18-year period found that NFP saved the government $17,310 per family in public benefit costs, resulting in a net savings of $4,732 in government costs (in 2009 dollars) such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) payments. This finding would likely be welcomed by the Trump administration, which announced earlier this month it was tightening the rules for obtaining food stamp benefits, ending them for about 700,000 Americans.

“It’s rare for studies of early-intervention programs to examine early-intervention effects over an 18-year period,” said David Olds, professor of pediatrics at University of Colorado and one of the lead investigators of the studies, in a press release. “This early intervention, Nurse-Family Partnership, produced long-term improvements in the cognitive functioning of 18-year-old youth born to mothers who had limited personal resources to cope with the adversities of living in deep poverty. This new evidence shows promise that Nurse-Family Partnership’s effects may carry over into adulthood.”

‘She was here like a mom’

That’s welcome news for young women such as Latreta Turner, 24, a single mom living in Montgomery, Ala. As a carhop at a Sonic drive-in restaurant who earns just $3.13 an hour plus tips, she struggles with the stresses of poverty and homelessness, not to mention the lingering grief over two previous miscarriages. And she spends most of her time — “I’d say 90 percent” — worrying about how she will provide for her 18-month-old, Aubrey.

But she’s also been working consistently with Lori Rogers, a visiting nurse of NFP Montgomery, who begins working with moms in their third trimester of pregnancy, coaching them to set goals, reduce stress and get healthy.

“The whole point is to just try to see what we can do to bring this environment to a safer, more calm place for this mom to develop her baby,” says Amy Trammell, director of nursing for NFP at Gift of Life in Montgomery.

Rogers says that, through her work with Turner, “when she was feeling stressed, we talked about stressors, we talked about how she could overcome those or deal with them in a better way.” For Turner, that presence was vital.

“Honestly,” she says, “I wouldn't have thought I would have made it if it wasn't for nurse Lori, because it's so new to me.”

Another client of Rogers’s is Breanna Watkins, 20, who describes how the support of NFP has brought support, love and consistency into the lives of her and her baby.

“It wasn't even just she was here as a nurse, she was here like a mom, like a second mom. So everything she ever told me, everything she ever gave ... even a little care, made me feel like I was loved by many,” she says. “And just for an outside person to … come and love you like their own, that makes a big impact.”

Love, yes … but what about more money?

As Shonkoff explains, this research is grounded in science. “The way biology works is, if you're threatened or you're dealing with hardship, biology is trying to get you on the course of healthy development. What pulls it off is adversity and all of these obstacles,” he says. “The goal here is not so much to give people special treatment or have children be coddled. It’s to take the weight off their necks. Take the weight of adversity and poverty and racism and violence and give children a chance to flourish.”

What if there could be more than one way to approach the removal of that weight? It’s a question now being explored by a team of researchers — experts in public policy, education, psychology, pediatrics and neuroscience — who are conducting the first U.S. randomized study, called Baby’s First Years, to assess the impact of poverty reduction on brain development.

“What if we tried to help young children in poverty by simply giving their families more money?” asks neuroscientist, pediatrician and lead researcher Kim Noble in a January 2019 TED Talk about the study, which, in 2018, recruited 1,000 new mothers living below the federal poverty line to receive unconditional monthly cash gifts for the first 40 months of their children’s lives. The mothers have been randomized, with some receiving a nominal gift and others receiving several hundred dollars a month, increasing some incomes by 25 percent.

“While income might not be the only or even most important factor in determining children’s brain development, it may be one that, from a policy perspective, can be easily addressed.”

Results won’t be in for several years, but Noble is hopeful that the findings could provide yet one more solution when it comes to stopping the cycle of intergenerational poverty, noting that “our experiences change our brains,” in a phenomenon known as neuroplasticity.

“The brain is not destiny,” she says. “And if a child’s brain can be changed, then anything is possible.”

And if anything is possible, then babies being born into adverse and stressful world of poverty does not have to mean the end of the story — whether it’s because of the love of a NFP representative or other consistent figure, an influx of cash or anything else that can “take the weight off their necks,” as Shonkoff says.

“It's absolutely not the end of the story,” says Babcock, “and I think that's the gift that this science provides us. Because it says very, very clearly that our past is not prologue, that we can change the destiny that might have been mapped out for us.”

"Children Produce Weaker Coronavirus Antibodies, Study Finds",['Apoorva Mandavilli'],"A closed playground at Lincoln Park in Los Angeles, to slow the spread of the coronavirus, on July 3, 2020. (Kendrick Brinson/The New York Times)

Children infected with the coronavirus produce weaker antibodies and fewer types of them than adults do, suggesting they clear their infection much faster, according to a new study published Thursday.

Other studies have suggested that an overly strong immune response may be to blame in people who get severely ill or die from COVID-19. A weaker immune response in children may paradoxically indicate that they vanquish the virus before it has had a chance to wreak havoc in the body, and may help explain why children are mostly spared severe symptoms of COVID, the disease caused by the coronavirus. It may also show why they are less likely to spread the virus to others.

“They may be infectious for a shorter time,” said Donna Farber, an immunologist at Columbia University in New York who led the study reported in the journal Nature Immunology.

Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times

Having weaker and fewer antibodies does not mean that children would be more at risk of re-infections, other experts said.

“You don’t really need a huge, overly robust immune response to maintain protections over some period of time,” said Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. “I don’t know that I would be especially worried that kids have a little bit lower antibody response.”

The study looked at children’s antibody levels at a single point in time, and was too small to provide insights into how the levels may vary with age. But it could pose questions for certain antibody tests that may be missing children who have been infected.

Farber and her colleagues analyzed antibodies to the coronavirus in four groups of patients: 19 adult convalescent plasma donors who had recovered from COVID without being hospitalized; 13 adults hospitalized with acute respiratory distress syndrome resulting from severe COVID; 16 children hospitalized with multi-system inflammatory syndrome, the rare condition affecting some infected children; and 31 infected children who did not have the syndrome. About half of this last group of children had no symptoms at all.

Story continues

Individuals in each group had antibodies, consistent with other studies showing that the vast majority of people infected with the coronavirus mount a robust immune response.

“This further emphasizes that this viral infection in itself, and the immune response to this virus, is not that different from what we would expect” from any virus, said Petter Brodin, an immunologist at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm.

But the range of antibodies differed between children and adults. The children made primarily one type of antibody, called IgG, that recognizes the spike protein on the surface of the virus. Adults, by contrast, made several types of antibodies to the spike and other viral proteins, and these antibodies were more powerful at neutralizing the virus.

Children had “less of a protective response, but they also had less of a breadth of an antibody response,” Farber said. “It’s because those kids are just not getting infected as severely.”

Neither group of children had antibodies to a viral protein called the nucleocapsid, or N, that is entangled with the genetic material of the virus. Because this protein is found within the virus and not on its surface, the immune system would only see it and make antibodies to it if the virus were widely disseminated in the body, she said.

“You don’t really see any of that in the children, and that suggests that there’s really a reduced infection course if these kids are getting infected,” she explained.

The finding could undermine the results from tests designed to pick up antibodies to the N protein of the virus. Many antibody tests, including those made by Abbott and Roche and offered by Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp, are specific to the N antibodies and so may miss children who have successfully cleared the virus. “That’s absolutely an interesting implication of that finding,” Brodin said.

Lower levels of virus in the body would also explain why children seem generally to transmit the virus less efficiently than adults do.

But experts urged some caution in interpreting the results because they represent samples taken from people at a single point in time.

Samples from the more severely affected children and adults were collected within 24 to 36 hours of being admitted or intubated for respiratory failure; those from children with mild or no symptoms were banked after medical procedures.

The type of antibodies produced by the body varies over the time course of an infection. This was a limitation of this study because the researchers may have been comparing people at different points in their infection, Brodin said. “You risk comparing apples and oranges.”

Other experts cautioned that the study was too small to draw conclusions about how the immune response may vary in children of different ages. The children in the study ranged in age from 3 to 18 years, with a median age of 11. But some studies have suggested that teenagers may be just as much at risk from the coronavirus as adults.

“It’s very important to understand what happens in children,” to understand the nature of their illness, but also how they contribute to spread of the virus in the community, said Dr. Maria L. Gennaro, an immunologist at Rutgers University. But “to try and stratify by age, it’s a little bit of a stretch in the analysis,” she said.

The researchers were also not able to explain why children have a more limited antibody response.

Having fewer types of antibodies may seem like a bad thing, but “having a ton of antibody isn’t necessarily a marker of a good thing,” said Bhattacharya. “It usually means that something went wrong early in the response.”

At least one other study has suggested that children have a powerful inborn immune system, intended to combat the many new pathogens they encounter, and that this first line of defense may clear the infection early without needing to rely on later antibodies.

Another possibility is that the children have some protection — in the form of immune cells called memory T cells — from previous encounters with common cold coronaviruses.

“Is it all innate? Or could there actually be some preexisting memory?” Bhattacharya said. “I think those are both possible.”

MLB won't discipline Justin Turner for World Series celebration after positive test

Major League Baseball accepted part of the blame for third baseman Justin Turner’s actions during the Los Angeles Dodgers’ World Series celebration when he returned to the field after his positive COVID-19 test, saying there was miscommunication, and determined that he will not be disciplined.

He was shown on the field hugging teammates, kissing his wife, holding the World Series trophy, and posing for team pictures with his mask off, sitting next to Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, a cancer survivor.

MLB said in its findings that Turner's teammates wanted him to join them and were willing to accept the risk, since they had already been exposed to Turner; that Turner thought he received permission from a Dodgers' employee to return to the field; and that, once on the field, ""was incorrectly told by an unidentified person that other players had tested positive, creating the impression in Mr. Turner’s mind that he was being singled out for isolation.""

Turner said Friday he has apologized to almost everyone on the field for putting them at further risk and not keeping his mask on.

Massachusetts residents will be breaking law if out during curfew starting Friday night

Starting Friday night, Massachusetts residents will be breaking the law if they're out between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m., unless on the way to or from work or school. The curfew is the latest effort to stem the growing COVID-19 outbreak in the state, which was hard-hit in the spring but enjoyed a low infection rate in the summer and early fall.

In the last week, the state, which had around 200 cases a day for most of the summer, has routinely seen daily caseloads above 1,200. And it's likely to get worse.

The move is aimed at closing restaurants and bars earlier in the night, before people lose their inhibitions and get careless about COVID-19 safeguards. But it remains to be seen whether criminalizing such everyday activities as a late-night stroll is a good idea – or will have any effect on the virus case count.

William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, said he's dubious curfews will do much to curb infections. ""Curtailing the evening for dining by an hour or so isn't likely to make a very large impact,"" said Hanage. ""I can't think of a single place where further action was not necessary.""

Denver enacts stay-at-home order starting Sunday until Dec. 7

In a similar effort, Denver announced Friday it will begin a nightly ""Home By 10"" order, requiring residents to remain in their homes from 10 p.m. until 5 a.m.

The order goes into effect Sunday and runs until Dec. 7. It will be temporarily suspended on Thanksgiving Day.

Unless traveling to and from work or for an essential business allowed to be open during those hours, residents must remain home and cannot congregate with anyone outside of their dwelling.

Infection rates and hospitalizations are rising, with Denver’s seven-day moving average of new cases at 419 on Thursday, up from 290 on Oct. 29.

Grocers limiting toilet paper, other purchases amid virus surge

Some grocery store chains are bringing back limits on purchasing certain items including toilet paper as COVID-19 cases spike in the U.S.

In a statement to USA TODAY, Kroger said they have ""proactively and temporarily set purchase limits to two per customer"" on items including toilet paper, paper towels, disinfecting wipes and hand soap. The limits went into effect around Monday, the grocer chain said.

Other chains that have reimposed limits in recent days include H-E-B and the Giant Company. Wegmans said it has had limits on purchasing toilet paper and paper towels since May and will continue to maintain them.

When the coronavirus pandemic first upended the lives of Americans in March, consumers rushed to stores to stockpile products such as toilet paper, paper towels and disinfecting wipes.

Kentucky hospitals face surge in cases as beds fill, health care workers get virus

After weeks of stabilizing, the COVID-19 unit at Louisville's Jewish Hospital is full and staying full with seriously ill patients hospitalized for days or even weeks.

""My census is higher now than it was back at the beginning of the pandemic, and that scares me a lot,"" Dr. Valerie Briones-Pryor, a University of Louisville Health physician, told members of the Louisville Metro Board of Health on Wednesday.

A new surge of COVID-19 cases in Kentucky and nationwide prompted Louisville officials to warn Tuesday that the local health system could be overwhelmed if people don't take the steps to avoid the virus more seriously.

""If the numbers continue to go up like they are right now, we will have to do something else because our hospital system will be overrun,"" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said.

While Kentucky, with more than 11,000 hospital beds statewide, appears to have adequate capacity for such patients, health officials say the larger problem is ensuring enough health care workers, as some come down with COVID-19 or must quarantine because of exposure.

A Missouri poll worker with COVID-19 has died

An election judge supervisor who tested positive for COVID-19 and was aware of the test result still worked at a Missouri polling place and has since died, health officials say.

The election official worked at a suburban St. Louis polling site in St. Charles County, where nearly 2,000 people voted on Tuesday.

The official, whose has not been identified, was informed of their positive test on Oct. 30 and was told to quarantine for 14 days. A cause of death was not immediately provided.

Economy adds 638K jobs in October as unemployment falls amid virus spikes

The U.S. economy added 638,000 jobs in October as payroll growth roughly held steady despite a surge in COVID-19 cases and Congress’s failure to provide more aid to unemployed Americans and struggling businesses. The unemployment rate fell from 7.9% to 6.9%, the Labor Department said Friday.

Economists had estimated that 600,000 jobs were added last month, according to a Bloomberg survey.

Although last month’s employment gains were outsized by historical standards, the increases have slowed for four straight months since peaking at 4.8 million in June. The nation has recovered about 12 million, or 55%, of the 22 million jobs wiped out in the health crisis as states have reopened restaurants, shops and other businesses shuttered by the outbreak, and brought back many furloughed workers.

But recovering the rest could take several years, economists say, and a growing share of temporary job losses have become permanent as businesses downsize or close for good.

AstraZeneca CEO says trial data hopefully available by end of year

AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said Thursday that the company is hoping to show its COVID-19 vaccine candidate is safe and effective by the end of the year.

Manufacturing of the potential vaccine is also being boosted, with the plan to have hundreds of millions of doses available in January, Soriot said.

AstraZeneca is working with Oxford to develop its vaccine candidates, and it is one of a few potential vaccines currently in late stage clinical trials in the U.S. Trials are also being conducted in the United Kingdom and other countries to determine the potential vaccine's effectiveness and safety.

“We have aligned the timing of delivery of vials to the timing of the clinical trial readout,” Soriot told analysts on a conference call. “On a global basis, we’ll be ready to supply hundreds of millions of doses of vaccine around the world by January.”

Most states are setting weeklong case records. That hasn't happened since April.

A USA TODAY analysis of Johns Hopkins data through late Thursday shows 27 states set records for new cases in a week while five states had a record number of deaths in a week.

The last time most states in the U.S. were setting case count records for a week wasn't in the summer surge of COVID-19 but the week ending April 7.

New case records were set in Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Record numbers of deaths were reported in New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma and South Dakota.

The USA TODAY analysis of Johns Hopkins data also shows 46 states had more cases in the latest week than in the week before. Forty-three states had a higher rate of people testing positive than the week before, an analysis of COVID Tracking Project data shows.

Idaho hospitals running out of room as COVID-19 cases spike; 2 flu deaths

Idaho hospitals are running out of space for COVID-19 patients as cases continue to surge statewide. At least 671 Idaho residents have died from the coronavirus, and a record high of 1,290 new COVID-19 cases were reported on Wednesday, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, followed by 1,265 new cases Thursday.

Meanwhile, the state's Disaster Medical Advisory Community on Tuesday sent a letter to Gov. Brad Little asking him to impose a statewide mask mandate. The committee, which was tasked with setting Idaho’s triage guidelines during an emergency, said a mask mandate would slow the spread of the virus and help hospitals avoid having to ration care.

As coronavirus cases surge statewide, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare on Wednesday announced the state's first flu-related deaths this season. Both individuals – a Blaine County man older than 60 and a Twin Falls County woman older than 80 – also had COVID-19 when they died.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills orders stricter mask mandate amid COVID-19 surge

Maine Gov. Janet Mills issued a new executive order Thursday requiring people to wear a face covering regardless of whether they can physically distance from others as. The new order strengthened a previously issued mask mandate that required face masks only if physically distancing was difficult to maintain.

“We have recorded yet another day of record high case numbers. This deadly and dangerous virus is spreading all across our state,” Mills said. “Protect your family. Protect a health care worker. Protect the elderly. Wear your face covering. Save lives. It is that simple.”

The state set a new single-day record of COVID-19 cases on Thursday with 183 new infections, WMTW reported. That brings the total count to 7,260 infections. No new deaths were reported Thursday, leaving the death toll at 150.

Report: NFL's Las Vegas Raiders to pay hefty price for COVID-19 violations

The Las Vegas Raiders will face the heftiest punishment of any team to date for multiple violations of the NFL's COVID-19 protocols. The league is fining the organization $500,000 and coach Jon Gruden $150,000, Yahoo Sports reported Thursday. The Raiders also will be stripped of a sixth-round draft pick, per the report.

No other team has been docked a draft selection for violating the league's COVID-19 policies. The Tennessee Titans were fined $350,000 in October after a joint investigation between the league and NFL Players Association determined the organization did not properly relay information to players during its COVID-19 outbreak and at times had personnel not wearing masks in the facility.

After Raiders right tackle Trent Brown tested positive for COVID-19 two weeks ago, the NFL found video evidence that included several players not wearing masks or face shields and not adhering to social distancing on the sidelines, a person with knowledge of the league's investigation told USA TODAY Sports under the condition of anonymity.

Pac-12 opener canceled as California can't field a team because of positive tests

The opening college football weekend of the Pac-12 season just got smaller. Saturday's scheduled game between California and Washington has been canceled, the conference announced Thursday.

In a release, the Pac-12 said Cal had requested the move because the team could not meet the minimum requirement of scholarship players for the game due to the number of positive COVID-19 cases among its players.

The game will be not be rescheduled and will be declared a no contest.

There will now be five Pac-12 games this weekend. The league had pushed its opening back later than any Bowl Subdivision league due to the challenges of playing during the pandemic. See the complete list of games affected by the virus here.

Navajo Nation orders more weekend curfews amid second COVID-19 wave

The Navajo Nation late Wednesday announced two additional weekend-long curfews, citing a second wave of COVID-19 cases. The announcement came hours after tribal officials warned of an ""uncontrolled spread"" of COVID-19 within more than 20 of the tribe's communities.

The tribe's health department ordered the 56-hour weekend curfews, beginning at 9 p.m. Friday until 5 a.m. on Nov. 9, according to a news release from the Navajo Nation executive branch. A second curfew with the same time constraints was set for the weekend of Nov. 13 through Nov. 16, the news release said.

""If you don’t need to purchase essential items or services and if you’re not an essential employee, then you should be at home during the 56-hour weekend curfew,"" Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez said in the news release.

Denmark defends virus measures after mink mutation,[],"Denmark on Friday defended the strict measures it has imposed on the north of the country after a mutated version of the new coronavirus linked to mink farms was found in humans.

Copenhagen has warned that the mutation could threaten the effectiveness of any future vaccine, and has ordered the slaughter of all of the country's minks, estimated at up to 17 million.

""These are timely and necessary measures"" amid a ""worrying"" development, Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said at a press conference for foreign press.

The Scandinavian country on Wednesday announced the mutation had jumped from minks to humans and infected 12 people.

Those cases were all detected in the North Jutland region, officials said Friday, correcting earlier information that the region was home to 11 of the 12 cases.

In seven North Jutland municipalities, the estimated 280,000 residents were on Thursday urged to stay within their municipal borders to limit the spread of infection.

Public transport in the region has been halted and bars and restaurants ordered shut, and some schoolchildren will also have classes online in restrictions that are due to last a month.

Scientists say virus mutations are common and often harmless, and this one doesn't cause a more severe illness in humans.

But Danish health authorities have expressed concern that this strain, known as ""Cluster 5"", is not inhibited by antibodies to the same degree as the normal virus, which they fear could threaten the efficacy of vaccines that are being developed across the globe.

Scientists around the world have noted that little is known about ""Cluster 5"", urging Danish authorities to share their research.

In addition, the 12 human cases date back to September with no new cases reported since, raising questions Friday about whether Denmark had overreacted.

""We'd rather take a step too far than a step too little,"" Kofod told reporters.

Further research on ""Cluster 5"" is ongoing, Danish officials said.

Story continues

The Stockholm-based European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said Friday it was ""in close contact"" with Danish health authorities on the issue.

""The possibility of an antigenic mutation in SARS-CoV-2 may have potential implications for immunity, reinfections and the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, but there is currently high uncertainty. Further analyses and scientific studies are needed to better understand the identified mutations and their potential implications,"" it said.

On Friday, more than 100 mink farmers protested against the mink slaughter, which is due to be completed in a few weeks.

Common cold antibodies hold clues to COVID-19 behavior; lung scans speed COVID-19 diagnosis in stroke patients,['Nancy Lapid'],"By Nancy Lapid

(Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.





Common cold antibodies yield clues to COVID-19 behavior

Among people who were never infected with the new coronavirus, a few adults - and many children - may have antibodies that can neutralize the virus, researchers reported on Friday in Science. Among 302 such adults, 16 (5.3%) had antibodies, likely generated during infections with ""common cold"" coronaviruses, that reacted to a specific region of the spike protein on the new virus called the S2 subunit. Among 48 children and adolescents, 21 (43.8%) had these antibodies. In test tube experiments, blood serum from both older and younger uninfected individuals with cross-reactive antibodies could neutralize the new coronavirus. That was not the case with serum from study participants who lacked these antibodies. ""Together, these findings may help explain higher COVID-19 susceptibility in older people and provide insight into whether pre-established immunity to seasonal coronaviruses offers protection against SARS-CoV-2,"" the publishers of the journal said in a statement. The findings also suggest that targeting the S2 subunit on the coronavirus spike protein might be the basis for a drug or vaccine that works on multiple types of coronavirus.

Lung CT speeds COVID-19 diagnosis in stroke patients

In emergency-room patients with stroke, lung imaging studies can help detect COVID-19 before results of nasal and throat swab tests come back, researchers say. Stroke can be a sign of COVID-19, but swab results can take days to become available. At three New York City hospitals in March and April, doctors ordered computed tomography angiograms (CTA) on 57 stroke patients within 24 hours of hospital admission, to look for COVID-19-related pneumonia. Thirty patients turned out to have COVID-19, based on their nasal swab results. But the CTA scans, in combination with patients' symptoms like cough and shortness of breath, allowed for the diagnosis of COVID-19 with 83% accuracy before the swab test results were received. Screening stroke patients for possible COVID-19 based only on symptoms is unreliable, because they may not have symptoms or they might not be able to speak, the researchers point out in their report in the American Heart Association journal Stroke. ""Early diagnosis via CT scans has helped our center protect other patients and staff through early isolation, and it has also allowed us to start early supportive care for those suspected of having stroke who are COVID-19 positive,"" coauthor Dr. Charles Esenwa of the Montefiore Medical Center said in a news release.

New coronavirus sneaks out of cells ""with the trash""

The new coronavirus uses a surprising pathway to exit infected cells and go on to infect others, researchers have discovered. It hijacks a cell structure called the lysosome, which is normally where cellular trash goes to be destroyed. But the virus uses lysosomes as escape hatches, the researchers report in Cell. ""To my knowledge coronavirus is one of 2 or 3 viruses to do this, and certainly the only enveloped virus,"" said coauthor Nihal Altan-Bonnet of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, referring to viruses that have a membrane surrounding their genetic material. ""All other enveloped viruses ... use other pathways for cell-to-cell spread,"" Altan-Bonnet added. These include influenza, hepatitis C, Dengue, Zika, West Nile and Ebola. When lysosomes degrade bacteria and viruses into little pieces, she explained, ""these little pieces get presented on the surface of the cell to alert the immune system"" to the invaders' presence. By using the trash disposal system of the cell to get out, the new coronavirus disables the lysosome and disrupts alerting the immune system, she said. ""We believe our discovery of the pathway used by coronaviruses to get out of cells will be fundamental to our understanding of how these viruses wreak havoc on our body, in particular our immune system.""

UK faces 'significant disruption' from Brexit: govt watchdog,[],"Government failures to prepare for Brexit mean the UK faces ""significant disruption"" when it is fully free of the European Union on January 1, an official watchdog said Friday.

The coronavirus pandemic will add to the strain on freight, farming and other economic sectors, especially in Northern Ireland, with or without an EU trade deal, the National Audit Office (NAO) said.

Britain formally left the EU in January but remains bound by its rules under a transition period until the end of this year.

The two sides are currently battling to thrash out a new economic partnership, but Britain's full exit will mean changes either way, in particular customs checks for trucks heading to the EU from British ports.

In a report, the NAO backed up complaints by business leaders who have been warning for months that the government is putting all the pressure on companies to prepare, but failing to do enough itself.

""Even if government makes further progress with its preparations, there is still likely to be significant disruption at the border from 1 January 2021 as traders will be unprepared for new EU border controls which will require additional administration and checks,"" the NAO said.

NAO chief Gareth Davies said: ""The January 1 deadline is unlike any previous EU exit deadline -- significant changes at the border will take place and government must be ready.""

He added that the situation was all the more challenging because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The watchdog's report said computing systems have yet to be tested for outbound freight, and transit areas for lorries were not ready.

It said the government had also yet to appoint enough customs agents, despite their ""vital"" role in ensuring trade flows smoothly from next year.

Under its ""reasonable worst-case scenario"", the UK government concedes that queues of up to 7,000 heavy-goods vehicles could develop in southeast England from January 1 as the post-transition period kicks in.

Story continues

It insists it has ploughed more than £700 million ($920 million) into border infrastructure, but business groups say they are hampered especially by the slow rollout of critical IT systems identified in the NAO report.

The auditors also highlighted concerns about checks that will be required for goods moving from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland, which shares a border with EU member Ireland.

Northern Ireland's agriculture department has been ""severely hampered"" by the ongoing trade talks with Brussels and a ""lack of clarity"" over the measures required.

As a result, the devolved administration in Northern Ireland is having to explore ""contingency options"" after January 1, the NAO said.

What To Do If You Think You Have Coronavirus,[],"Now that the coronavirus outbreak has affected people in more than 100 countries, awareness of COVID-19 is at an all-time high, making people across the globe wonder if their latest sniffle could be a symptom.

Here’s what you should know about the virus’s symptoms and what you should do if you experience them. Remember that it’s important to take precautions to protect not only your health and safety, but also the health and safety of others.

COVID-19 symptoms are often “mild.” Here’s what to look out for.

Dr. Linda Anegawa, an internist with virtual health platform PlushCare, previously told HuffPost that the main symptoms often appear similar to the flu, “such as fever over 100.5, cough, malaise, and occasionally nausea, diarrhea. In more severe cases, shortness of breath, chest pain and pneumonia will be apparent.”

Most people who contract the disease will experience “mild symptoms,” which may be “similar symptoms that you may experience with a cold or mild flu-like illness,” Kristin Dean, a board-certified physician and medical director at the telemedicine service Doctor on Demand, previously told HuffPost. “Most people experience a mild form of coronavirus with these symptoms being the most common: cough, body aches, runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion or diarrhea. In some cases, people who are infected will not exhibit any symptoms.”

Coronavirus can present as a common cold in mild cases, with a low-grade fever, chills, headache, fatigue and malaise. It’s important not to ignore these mild symptoms, and it could take anywhere from 2 to 14 days for an infected person to actually exhibit mild symptoms, with the average being about five days.

“An individual may think nothing of these symptoms because they do not significantly change or impact their daily lives,” Eudene Harry, a board-certified physician in emergency medicine and medical director for the Oasis Wellness & Rejuvenation Center in Orlando, Florida, previously told HuffPost.

Story continues

What to do if you’re displaying symptoms.

The biggest red flag is shortness of breath, followed by a high fever and worsening cough, in which case you should seek immediate medical attention. If you have a history of medical conditions that can decrease your immune system’s response, you’ll want to be extra cautious as well.

“Decreased immunity may be caused by some of the following conditions: being older than age 65, diabetes, heart disease, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, cancer, HIV or taking immunosuppressive medications,” Dean explained.

If you fall into one of those categories and are experiencing any symptoms, contact a health care provider via phone or a virtual video visit to talk it through and discuss the next steps. This is especially important if you have traveled to areas with high community transmission or been in contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19. (Even if you aren’t exhibiting symptoms, it is advisable to self-isolate for 14 days after contact.)

Conducting initial consultations through telemedicine networks can help reduce the spread of the virus by allowing health care workers to take protective measures to prepare for a visit from a potentially infectious patient. If you’re experiencing severe symptoms, however, call 911 to get immediate medical care.

Whatever you do, try not to panic.

“Most cases of COVID-19 will be mild and resolve on their own similar to the flu,” Anegawa said. “It’s best to stay home and out of public. However, if you have any severe symptoms such as a very high fever, severe cough or shortness of breath, it would be wise to seek in-person care.”

What to do if you’re unable to be diagnosed.

HuffPost has previously reported that due to test kit shortages in the U.S., people who show mild symptoms but haven’t been in contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients or visited high-risk areas may not be able to get a diagnosis. But it’s still important to stay home if you aren’t feeling well to help reduce the spread of illness.

“If you suspect you have COVID-19, please do not go to work, school or out in public places until you are directed to do so by a health care provider,” Dean said. “Mild COVID-19, just like other colds you have experienced, will typically resolve on its own by taking care of your health.”

She advised people who are exhibiting mild symptoms to get plenty of rest, stay hydrated and remain isolated from others.

“You can take over-the-counter cold remedies to help treat your symptoms, such as acetaminophen for fevers or headaches, and cough medications to alleviate coughing,” she added. “Since this illness is due to a virus, antibiotics are not effective. Stay in touch with your doctor about changes in your symptoms, and when it’s all right to return to your usual activities.”

Doctors still aren’t certain about how long patients infected with coronavirus are contagious, but one study suggests that those with mild cases are probably not infectious by about 10 days after they first experienced symptoms. Pending more conclusive research, however, it’s best to exercise caution and stay in touch with your doctor.

Avoiding high-risk places, washing hands, disinfecting surfaces, keeping a safe distance between people, not touching your face, and coughing or sneezing into elbows instead of hands are all measures everyone can take to help slow the rate of infection ― even if you aren’t experiencing symptoms. Taking care of yourself is one of the most selfless things you can do in the time of a pandemic.

“If everyone with a sore throat goes to the hospital, resources will be used unnecessarily,” said Jake Deutsch, a physician specializing in emergency medicine and co-founder of Specialty Infusion. “Statistically speaking, most people won’t need an intensive-care level of treatment, so make sure those resources are available for people who clearly are more at risk. If you don’t have underlying medical conditions, I’d recommend staying home until you’re not sick. Judge your symptoms and put them in context of your medical problems.”

Ultimately, it’s important to follow guidance from reputable public health leaders like the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“The best treatment we can provide is making sure people have correct information and can process everything,” Deutsch said.

A Few Coronavirus Facts To Keep In Mind When You're Panicking

What It Means When Doctors Say Coronavirus Symptoms Are Often 'Mild'

"Can you reuse a disposable mask? Yes, if you follow these steps",['Kerry Breen'],"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends wearing face coverings to slow the spread of coronavirus, but for those who wear disposable masks, there's a frequent question: Can disposable masks like N95 and surgical masks be re-worn?

In short? Yes, but only if you take care of them correctly.

""Number one: Don't touch your mask,"" said Dr. Lucian Davis, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health who studies respiratory infections and noted that touching the mask could transfer virus particles onto the surface. ""If you do touch your mask, wash [your hands] with soap and water or with alcohol for sure. If you need to remove it, do it in a safe place where you're not close to others.""

How to safely remove, clean and store a disposable mask

To safely remove your mask and touch as little of its surface as possible, use the ear straps to remove and handle the mask. Davis said it's likely that the majority of virus particles would be on the front, so avoid touching that part of the mask.

Once the disposable mask is safely removed, place it in a convenient but safe storage spot. Jade Flinn, MSN, the nurse educator for the Biocontainment Unit at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said that she and other coworkers were placing masks in paper bags or other ""clean receptacles"" with ""good ventilation"" that allow the mask to ""air out."" Davis said that he had seen the same.

""Many of us are just using those brown paper sacks that we used to take our lunch to work in,"" he said. ""Those have some structure to them, and you can drop it in and close it up.""

Davis also recommended using a plastic Tupperware or Ziploc bag, but emphasized the need to not touch the edges of the bag. Rather than trying to clean a disposable mask, Flinn and Davis both recommended just leaving it in a clean, contained environment for a few days.

""We aren't disinfecting or cleaning these types of materials because, particularly if you're using a disinfectant, then you're kind of putting it into the fabric, and then breathing it in,"" Flinn said. ""So I wouldn't do that. ... You're better off just putting it in a clean receptacle and letting it stay there for a day or two.""

""There are processes in hospitals for cleaning masks, but typically they involve different types of gases and special machines there, and they won't be available in the communities,"" Davis said. ""...Based on what we know about how long the virus can live on cardboard, which is similar material to paper, one would think that in 24 to 48 hours, those viruses would no longer be viable.""

Both Flinn and Davis said that if a mask is visibly dirty, soiled or torn, it should be thrown out immediately. Both recommended having a supply of at least three to five masks, so that one could be worn while others were being decontaminated.

""We have a limited supply of masks, so it makes sense that people are going to want to reuse them,"" Davis said. ""Just make sure to do it safely."""
Is There Any Safe Way to Socialize During the Coronavirus Pandemic?,['Jamie Ducharme'],"Of the many ways COVID-19 has changed American life, social distancing is among the toughest for many people to bear. Humans are social animals, hard-wired to crave touch and interaction. So it’s only natural that, as caution fatigue sets in and social-distancing guidelines in many places are extended into the indeterminate future, even well-intentioned people are looking for loopholes that allow them to reunite with loved ones.

But is there any safe way to see family or friends while following social-distancing guidelines?

“There’s no magic answer to that question,” says Jason Farley, a professor and nurse epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Schools of Nursing and Medicine.

There’s always risk

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officially recommends that people “avoid gatherings of any size outside your household, such as [in] a friend’s house, parks, restaurants, shops, or any other place.” That’s especially important for people who are sick; know or suspect they’ve been exposed to COVID-19; are in a high-risk group, like the elderly or immune-compromised; or live with someone who fits into any of these categories.

But you could get and spread coronavirus even if you don’t fall under one of those labels.

Many people who get COVID-19 develop either mild symptoms or none at all. That means you and your loved ones could be spreading the virus even if you feel fine, Farley says.

Even a negative test result only takes you so far, since diagnostic accuracy isn’t perfect and you could be exposed to the virus at any time. “There’s really no way of predicting, if you’ve been exposed and tested negative today, that you won’t test positive tomorrow,” Farley says. Testing positive for antibodies also doesn’t necessarily mean you’re immune to future infections, health officials say.

Keep up to date with our daily coronavirus newsletter by clicking here.

Wearing a mask, washing your hands regularly and limiting trips outside all reduce your risk of catching and passing on COVID-19, but “we can’t quantify [how much lower] that lower risk is,” Farley says. There’s also no demographic that’s truly safe from COVID-19—people of all ages have gotten seriously ill and died from the virus.

Story continues

Given all those risks and unknowns, “the most responsible option is to have [a social] visit virtually,” says Brandon Brown, an epidemiologist and associate professor in the Center for Healthy Communities at the University of California, Riverside. That will be the case until there’s a vaccine to confer widespread immunity, as well as better testing capacity and steady declines in deaths and cases to decrease the burden on the health care system, Brown says.

But there’s gray area

In a perfect infectious-disease-fighting model, everybody would stay home and socialize only with their cohabitants. But the realities of human existence are messier.

Flagrant social-distancing violations, like packed house parties, are unequivocally a bad idea. But there’s plenty of gray area. Is there any harm in a socially distant walk? If you live alone, can you see one friend? Is there a responsible way to move in with family?

There are also mental-health ramifications to consider. Isolation can take a serious toll on mental health, particularly for those already suffering from conditions like depression and anxiety. Unemployment, isolation and distress related to the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to about 75,000 additional “deaths of despair”—those related to suicide or substance misuse—in the U.S., according to a recent report. How do you weigh that against the risk of spreading a deadly infectious disease?

To help, some experts are advocating for a harm-reduction approach to social distancing, an idea that hinges on minimizing the negative consequences of potentially risky behaviors. That would mean teaching people how to see their loved ones as safely as possible, rather than telling them not to socialize at all and hoping—against proof and human nature—that they listen.

“We have been thinking about social distancing in this all-or-nothing way,” says Julia Marcus, an assistant professor of population medicine at Harvard Medical School. That was appropriate when lockdowns were first announced, Marcus says, but as containment measures drag on and on, it’s impractical not to address the gray area.

“People are already making choices every day around how to navigate risk,” Marcus says. “A harm-reduction approach would…give them the tools they need to reduce risk as much as possible.”

While there’s a diversity of opinion among health professionals about how much risk is acceptable, most agree that some forms of socializing are safer than others.

Outside seems better than in

There’s still a lot experts don’t know about how COVID-19 spreads. But Dr. Kelly Michelson, director of the Center for Bioethics and Medical Humanities at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, says most research suggests you are less likely to catch or transmit the virus if you’re outside, wearing a mask and keeping your distance from others.

Certain types of outdoor interaction are also better than others, Farley says. A cookout where people are touching the same utensils or eating from the same containers is higher risk than a socially distant walk, for example.

Patricia Rieker, a medical sociologist at Boston University, adds that one-on-one meetings are safer than group gatherings. She invited one friend to her condo building’s outdoor area over the weekend, but only after wiping down their chairs and placing them 10 feet apart and finding a way for her friend to get into the common area without entering her home. They also wore masks. “It took me 45 minutes to prepare for that to happen safely,” Rieker says. “You can’t do anything in a way that I would call spontaneous.”

Trust is important

Rieker says she felt comfortable seeing her friend because she knew they both took social distancing seriously. That trust is paramount, Rieker says, because seeing somebody right now means you’re potentially exposing yourself to all of their prior brushes with the virus.

If you really trust somebody, Rieker says it’s not out of the question to explore moving in with them, as long as it’s done safely. Even though testing isn’t 100% accurate, Rieker says both parties should get tested before moving in.

Brown says both parties should shelter in place for at least two weeks before combining households. Michelson agrees, and adds that it’s important to ensure that “this surrogate family member or friend is protecting themselves in a way that’s going to be safe for you.” In other words: moving in together is not a license to let other disease-prevention practices lapse.

Sharing a bed or having close physical contact requires even more trust, and exposes you both to more risk. Writing in the Annals of Internal Medicine on May 8, a group of Boston-based physicians noted that all in-person sexual contact likely comes with some risk of spreading COVID-19, leaving health care providers with “little to offer beyond guidance not to engage in any in-person sexual activity.” Still, they acknowledged that total abstinence is not always a viable option, and noted that virtual sexual activity, or physical contact with a live-in quarantine partner, is safest.

Context matters

COVID-19 is not spreading identically in all parts of the U.S. If you have your heart set on socializing, the onus is on you to understand the specific public-health guidelines and situation in your area, Rieker says. If you live in a densely populated area where coronavirus is spreading rapidly, it may be hard or even impossible to find a way to socialize safely. It’s important to stay mindful of that—especially since social distancing is really about the common good, and making sure that as few people as possible get sick.

“Staying safe is a multi-layered issue of what you do for yourself, what you are going to hope that other people will do for themselves, and what, collectively, everybody does in the community,” Rieker says. “You are required to think about the larger good.”

Limiting social contact, as hard as it is, really is an altruistic move. Even if you, personally, accept the risk of seeing another person, you need to consider how your actions could affect public health and burdens on the health care system. That sort of thinking should be extra motivation for taking as few risks as possible, and minimizing the risks that you do take. Doing so will help bring the coronavirus pandemic to its end.

“In the short term, everyone is going to hurt,” Brown says. “But in the long term, the problems of the pandemic will get better.”"
How can I tell the difference between the flu and COVID-19?,['The Associated Press'],"How can I tell the difference between the flu and COVID-19?

It’s impossible to tell without a test. Influenza and COVID-19 have such similar symptoms, you may need to get tested to know what's making you miserable.

Body aches, sore throat, fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue and headaches are symptoms shared by the two.

One difference? People with the flu typically feel sickest during the first week of illness. With COVID-19, people may feel the worst during the second or third week, and they may be sicker for a longer period.

Another difference: COVID-19 is more likely than the flu to cause a loss of taste or smell. But not everyone experiences that symptom, so it’s not a reliable way to tell the viruses apart.

That leaves testing, which will become more important as flu season ramps up this fall in the Northern Hemisphere. Doctors will need to know test results to determine the best treatment.

It’s also possible to be infected with both viruses at the same time, said Dr. Daniel Solomon, an infectious diseases expert at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.

Whether you get tested for one or both viruses may depend on how available tests are and which viruses are circulating where you live, he said.

“Right now we are not seeing community transmission of influenza, so widespread testing for the flu is not yet recommended,” Solomon said.

Both the flu and coronavirus spread through droplets from the nose and mouth. Both can spread before people know they are sick. The flu has a shorter incubation period — meaning after infection it can take one to four days to feel sick — compared to the coronavirus, which can take two to 14 days from infection to symptoms.

On average, COVID-19 is more contagious than flu. But many people with COVID-19 don’t spread the virus to anyone, while a few people spread it to many others. These “superspreader events” are more common with COVID-19 than flu, Solomon said.

Story continues

Preventing the flu starts with an annual flu shot tailored to the strains of the flu virus that are circulating. Health officials would like to see record numbers of people get flu shots this year so hospitals aren’t overwhelmed with two epidemics at once.

There’s no vaccine yet for COVID-19, although several candidates are in the final testing stages.

Precautions against COVID-19 — masks, social distancing, hand-washing — also slow the spread of the flu, so health officials hope continued vigilance could lessen the severity of this year's flu season.

How long can I expect a COVID-19 illness to last?,['The Associated Press'],"How long can I expect a COVID-19 illness to last?

It depends. Most coronavirus patients have mild to moderate illness and recover quickly. Older, sicker patients tend to take longer to recover. That includes those who are obese, or have high blood pressure and other chronic diseases.

The World Health Organization says recovery typically takes two to six weeks. One U.S. study found that around 20% of non-hospitalized individuals ages 18 to 34 still had symptoms at least two weeks after becoming ill. The same was true for nearly half of people age 50 and older.

Among those sick enough to be hospitalized, a study in Italy found 87% were still experiencing symptoms two months after getting sick. Lingering symptoms included fatigue and shortness of breath.

Dr. Khalilah Gates, a Chicago lung specialist, said many of her hospitalized COVID-19 patients still have coughing episodes, breathing difficulties and fatigue three to four months after infection.

She said it’s hard to predict exactly when COVID-19 patients will return to feeling well.

“The unsettling part of all this is we don’t have all the answers,” said Gates, an assistant professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

It’s also hard to predict which patients will develop complications after their initial illness subsides.

COVID-19 can affect nearly every organ, and long-term complications can include heart inflammation, decreased kidney function, fuzzy thinking, anxiety and depression.

It is unclear whether the virus itself or the inflammation it can cause leads to these lingering problems, said Dr. Jay Varkey, an Emory University infectious diseases specialist.

“Once you get over the acute illness, it’s not necessarily over,” he said.

Today is the last day to cast your ballot in the 2020 election, after a hellishly long campaign and debate season that can only be described as “chaotic evil.” Of course, many people have already voted by mail, dropped off their ballots, or voted early in person. But if today is your official voting day, you might have questions about the safety of the different approaches to voting in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the U.S. The novel coronavirus has killed nearly 231,000 people in the U.S. and infected more than 9.3 million, according to the New York Times. We know it’s often passed via respiratory droplets that are expelled when infected people cough or talk, which can make us understandably anxious about being around others, especially indoors. But that fear shouldn’t discourage you from exercising your right to cast a ballot. “I think voting can be done totally safely and think people should do it,” says Paul Pottinger, MD, a professor specializing in infectious disease at the University of Washington School of Medicine. “No one should be intimidated or frightened.” We asked him for advice on how to stay safe this year. Vote by mail “It’s totally safe and very effective to vote by mail, and the vote is well tracked,” Dr. Pottinger told Refinery29 in September. “It also has an unexpected benefit this year: You’re not going to get sick voting by mail.” But there is a big but: Depending on your state, it might be too late now to mail in your ballot. Do some research and figure out how late your state will count post-marked ballots. If you live in a state like Minnesota Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Georgia, or Wisconsin, it’s too late for this option, as your ballot must be received by Nov. 3 (today). But people have had other concerns about voting by mail this year. Some worried early on that mail-in ballots would be thrown out, intercepted, or interfered with, in part because of President Donald Trump’s statements casting doubt on the integrity of the process. Others believe that Trump may halt the “overtime count” (the counting of mail-in and provisional ballots after polls close on November 3), shifting the outcome in his favor. Drop off your absentee ballot That’s why, if you are able to, the best option now is to drop your absentee ballot off in an official dropbox, at your polling site, or at your local Board of Elections before the deadline in your area. You may have to go indoors, but you’ll likely be inside for less time and have to interact with fewer people than you would if you were standing in line. To minimize your risk, wear a well-fitting face mask, try to keep at least six feet away from others, and squirt on some hand sanitizer if you have to touch a mail slot or door handle during the process, Dr. Pottinger says. Vote In Person This is where things can seem scary, but Dr. Pottinger says it’s not much riskier than going to the grocery store, especially if you’re following the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention guidelines by wearing a face mask (that covers both your mouth and nose), keeping your distance from others, and avoiding touching your face. Because your ballot is supposed to be a secret, the beauty of polling places is that they’ll likely be set up with booths spread far apart from each other already. Some will be putting plexiglass barriers between voters and poll workers. If you have the flexibility, try to hit up your polling place during off hours, avoiding peak times when folks will be lining up to vote, such as right after work, suggests John O’Horo, MD, an infectious disease specialist at Mayo Clinic. Of course, it can help to come prepared. Consider bringing your own black pen with you, or some hand sanitizer to use if you opt for the shared pen, suggests Nate Favini, MD, the medical lead of Forward, a preventive primary care practice. Also bring along a zip lock baggie with extra masks, just in case. If someone in line near you isn’t wearing a mask, but is creeping a little too close for comfort, you can either offer them one of your spare masks, ask them to take a step back, or flag the issue to one of the volunteers working at your polling place. Some experts are saying this year is a good one to go to the polls alone, sans children. Dr. Pottinger disagrees, with a caveat. “I think having kids watch their parents vote is important,” he says. But the child’s face should be covered up, and they should be old enough to know to keep to themselves and not get close to others, even if the line is long. Another thing to think about: Increasingly, you’ll see people handing out food and coffees to voters waiting in long lines. Actor Paul Rudd was spotted handing out blueberry-and-cream cookies to voters who were waiting in the rain. Favini says you should consider your risk factors before accepting (yes, even if the snacks are coming from your favorite celebrity). “This comes down to personal risk tolerance on an individual level,” Dr. Favini says. If you’re at high risk of getting a severe COVID-19 infection, it may not be worth taking a chance on the snack. Consider bringing your own instead. Another consideration: “Well-meaning people handing out cookies have beautiful intentions,” says Jill Grimes, MD, board-certified family physician, and author of The Ultimate College Student Health Handbook: Your Guide for Everything from Hangovers to Homesickness. “But when you take off your mask to eat a cookie or sip on your Starbucks, you’re defeating the purpose of wearing a mask.” Consider accepting the sweet treat but saving it for after you vote. Also of note, Dr. Favini says it’s not a bad idea to get a coronavirus test a few days after you vote, especially if you live in an area with a high number of COVID-19 cases. This will help ensure you didn’t pick up the virus while voting, so you don’t spread it to others unknowingly. Dr Pottinger’s general advice is to vote, vote, vote. But there’s one exception. If you’re feeling really sick on Election Day, it’s best to stay home. It could ultimately save a life. “This is why I really advise people to vote by mail, or to vote early if that’s an option in your community.” Folks in many states have already begun the process of voting early, and some states allow a family member, caretaker, or designated person to drop off your absentee ballot for you if you are ill or unable to go yourself. In the end, no matter how you vote, it’s important to do so mindfully this year. “I have a very significant concern that people will do one of two things,” Dr. Pottinger says. “One is that people will ignore COVID-19, and the other is that they’ll be so scared of it that it paralyzes them. Neither is acceptable. People should vote. And they should just do it in a thoughtful, polite way that includes personal space and covering your face.” Like what you see?

We still cannot say, because not enough votes have been counted for either Donald Trump or Joe Biden to claim victory.

The huge number of postal votes cast during this pandemic election, and different states' laws about how to count them, meant this always was going to take longer if the race was tight.

Hasn't Joe Biden won the popular vote?

Yes, so far, and by a big margin, but that's not what decides who gets to be president.

Instead, a candidate has to win the majority in a system called the electoral college, where each state gets a certain number of votes or ""electors"" roughly in proportion to its population. If you win a state, you win all its votes (except Nebraska and Maine, but that's complicated). There are 538 state votes and the person who gets 270 wins the prize.

So what are we waiting for now?

Mr Biden is on 253 electoral college votes to Mr Trump's 214. There are several ways each of them could reach 270.

If Mr Biden gets Pennsylvania, that's all he needs - he is over the line. Georgia and any of Nevada, Arizona or North Carolina works for him too.

Mr Trump would need Pennsylvania's votes and to win three states out of Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada or Arizona.

So how are they doing in these states?

Georgia (16 votes): The story here is about how Mr Biden ate into Mr Trump's lead in a solid Republican state as postal votes and tallies from more Democratic counties came in. Mr Biden has taken a very slim lead in the state and there are still votes to be counted, such as military and overseas votes. But because the margin is so tight, there is going to be a recount.

Mr Biden has pulled ahead in Nevada. About 150,000 ballots are yet to be counted, many of them from Clark county, which leans Democratic. Arizona (11 votes): Joe Biden has a lead that is narrowing. Many of those votes still to be counted are from Maricopa County, home to 60% of the state's population - and Mr Trump has been catching up a bit as these votes get counted.

The story in one line?

Donald Trump has done better than expected and Joe Biden has failed to win those battleground states which count votes quickly, but the Democrat is closing the gap in crucial states as votes get counted.

Why do the numbers keep changing?

Each state has its own laws and systems for counting votes. Individual states are also in charge of the order in which they count different types of votes - for example postal votes are often counted last.

So that makes a difference when Republicans tend to vote in person on the day and postal votes tend to skew Democratic. As there were so many postal votes cast during this pandemic election, this is why we have seen such late dramatic shifts in who leads a race.

Another thing to be aware of is that different news outlets have different tallies for each candidate depending on where they get election data from. So some outlets have called Arizona for Mr Biden, but the BBC thinks it's still not decided.

Mr Trump has launched some legal challenges, but analysts suggest most of these challenges concern small numbers of ballots that might not make a difference in the end, with the exception of Pennsylvania, where the Supreme Court previously hinted it could revisit the rules about deadlines for accepting postal votes.

But the story here is not just the maths.

It now looks like polling data ahead of the election didn't tell us the whole story about the American public. Many observers didn't realise the race would be so tight.

Robert Cuffe, the BBC's head of statistics, says it's still too early to say whether this election has been a pollster's nightmare. Final national polls showed Mr Biden leading Mr Trump by about eight points. In battleground states Mr Biden also polled in the lead, but by a much slimmer margin.

Currently Mr Biden leads Mr Trump in the share of the popular vote by about three percentage points.

Some experts suspect there's a part of the American public which won't even participate in polls because they don't trust institutions - they're more likely to vote for Mr Trump.

Voter priorities may have also been slightly misjudged. While the coronavirus pandemic has dominated headlines, a survey conducted by Edison Research found that more voters (a third in total) listed the economy as their key issue - it was a core Trump message.

Mr Trump's vote also looks a little bit more diverse than many might have assumed."

Media mogul Rupert Murdoch's US outlets and the man himself have long been seen as keen Donald Trump supporters - but there may be a change of tone afoot.

Murdoch's Fox News, the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal all seem to be preparing their audiences for his defeat, and distancing themselves from the president.

Fox News angered Trump on election night by calling Arizona for Democrat Joe Biden. Since then, the network has largely stepped around the president's unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud.

""We just haven't seen it. It hasn't been presented to us,"" Fox News host Brett Baier said on air on Friday.

That said, Fox star Sean Hannity, who's close to Trump, declared on Thursday evening: ""Americans have every right to be suspicious... to distrust the legitimacy of the results.""

Though Trump has repeatedly questioned the integrity of the vote, he has offered no evidence of fraud. Election observers engaged to ensure a free and fair process have said they witnessed nothing untoward.

Fox, which helped Trump to power in 2016, seems to be preparing viewers for a Trump exit - and offering advice on how he should go about it.

Host Laura Ingraham, also seen as close to Trump, said on air: “If and when it's time to accept an unfavourable outcome in this election, and we hope it never comes, but if and when that does happen, President Trump needs to do it with the same grace and composure he demonstrated at that town hall with Savannah Guthrie. So many people remarked about his tone and presence. Exactly what he needs.

""Now losing, especially when you believe the process wasn’t fair, it’s a gut punch. And I’m not conceding anything tonight, by the way. But losing, if that’s what happens - it's awful. But President Trump's legacy will only become more significant if he focuses on moving the country forward.""

Murdoch's newspaper the Wall Street Journal has carried an opinion piece, entitled The Presidential Endgame , with a similar message.

""Mr Trump hates to lose, and no doubt he will fight to the end. But if defeat comes, he will serve himself and his country best by honoring America’s democratic traditions and leaving office with dignity,"" it said.

And Murdoch's tabloid New York Post ran two opinion pieces on Friday that made the assumption that Trump would probably lose the election.

As the vote count drags on, the Post has not embraced any of Trump's unsubstantiated statements about voter fraud and the election being stolen from him."

It's been three days since the US election. You might have reasonably expected to have some kind of clue about the results by now.

Okay, so who is going to be the next president?

We still cannot say, because not enough votes have been counted for either Donald Trump or Joe Biden to claim victory.

But the moment we will be able to tell you someone has won does seem to be getting much closer. And results are still coming in.

The huge number of postal votes cast during this pandemic election, and different states' laws about how to count them, meant this always was going to take longer if the race was tight.

Hasn't Joe Biden won the popular vote?

Are Donald Trump and Joe Biden the only candidates for president? And why are the voting systems in Maine and Nebraska different to the rest of the United States?

Here are some of your key questions around the US election answered.

If you vote for someone who is not a Democrat or Republican, what happens to your vote? Jan, Australia

Your vote will still count. Because the focus of the 2020 US presidential election campaign is on just two men, Donald Trump and Joe Biden, it's very easy to forget that there are many other candidates.

According to the Federal Election Commission, a whopping 1,214 presidential hopefuls have filed papers for this election.

The vast majority of candidates, including the musician Kanye West, only stood in a few places.

image copyright Reuters image caption Kanye West at his first presidential rally

However the Libertarian Party's Jo Jorgensen was on the ballot for all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

In October, the BBC heard from three of these other presidential candidates.

In 1968, a third-party candidate, George Wallace, garnered nearly ten million votes, winning five states. In 1992, nearly 20 million people voted for Ross Perot, although he won no states.

Why do Maine and Nebraska split their electoral college votes? Elizabeth, London

Maine and Nebraska are the only two US states where the candidate with most votes does not take all of its electoral college votes.

Instead, they use what is called the ""congressional district method"". Each state's electoral college vote is equal to its number of Senate seats - always two - plus its number of congressional districts.

The candidate with most votes in each congressional district takes one electoral college vote and then whoever wins the state-wide vote gains two more college votes.

Having briefly used the split-vote method in the 1820s, Maine reintroduced it in 1969. This was because of concerns that a candidate in a three-way presidential election, like that of 1968, could take all the state's electoral college votes with little over a third of the popular vote.

Nebraska has used the split-vote system since 1996, according to one commentator, ""to attract presidential candidates to a state they usually ignore because it's so reliably conservative.""

How does the point system work with the presidential race? Robert Williams, Sacramento

The number of electoral college members - known as electors - from each state is roughly in line with the size of its population. Each state has as many electors as it has lawmakers in the US Congress (representatives in the House and senators).

California has the most electors - 55 - while some states with smaller populations like Wyoming, Alaska and North Dakota (and Washington DC) have the minimum of three. There are 538 electors in total.

Each elector represents one electoral vote, and a candidate needs to gain a majority of the votes - 270 or more - to win the presidency.

Who are the members of the electoral college, how are they chosen and how long do they serve in the role? - Penny Reid, Northumberland, UK

The members of the electoral college are usually nominated by the Republican and Democratic parties for each election.

There are different rules for nominating them in each state, and they are officially selected on polling day.

The college members - known as electors - often have connections in the US political parties, like activists or former politicians.

Bill Clinton was a Democratic elector in 2016, and Donald Trump Junior was put forward by the Republicans.

Could Donald Trump try to contest the results of the election? - Basel, Israel

Yes. Both campaigns have said they're already preparing for legal disputes following the election.

They have a right to demand a recount in most states, usually if the result there is tight.

There's been a surge in postal voting this year, and it's also possible that the validity of these ballots could be challenged in court.

These lawsuits could make their way up to the US Supreme Court - the ultimate legal authority in the US.

This happened in 2000, when the Supreme Court stopped a recount in Florida and ruled in favour of Republican George W Bush, who became president.

What influence does the national vote have on the way the electoral college votes? - Caroline Bonwitt, Gloucestershire, UK

US presidents are not decided by the national popular vote, but by winning in enough states.

The winner in each state gets the support of a number of electors based roughly on its population.

These electors meet a few weeks after polling day - forming the electoral college - to vote to officially nominate the next president.

To win the White House, 270 electoral votes are needed.

media caption The US president is not chosen directly by voters, but by what's known as the electoral college

Pretty much everyone in the world is fed up with this ""electoral college"" nonsense. So how hard is it to just make US elections a majority vote and dump the college? - Judy, BC, Canada

The US electoral system is laid out in the constitution, so changing it would require a constitutional amendment.

This would have to be approved by two-thirds of both the Senate and the House of Representatives, or the same proportion of state legislatures. This would then need to be ratified by three-quarters of US states.

This is very unlikely to be successful, although there have been attempts to change the system in the past.

There is an ongoing effort by some states to award their electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote, no matter who wins there. This is a way off, but would effectively nullify the electoral college.

What happens if it's a tie? - Chinga, China

There are 538 electoral votes up for grabs, with a fixed number of electors representing each state based roughly on the size of its population.

This means a draw is possible at 269 votes each, although unlikely.

If no candidate gains a majority of votes in the electoral college, it would be up to the US Congress to decide.

Members of Congress elected in the 2020 elections would take on this responsibility.

The House of Representatives would vote to decide the president, with each state delegation having one vote - a majority of 26 is needed for a candidate to become president.

The Senate would select the vice-president, with all 100 senators having a vote.

Who will decide the presidency if there is no definitive winner via the electoral college? -Robert Pallone, Maryland

If there's no definite winner in the electoral college, it would mean there's either been a tie in the overall result (covered above), or that ongoing legal challenges in disputed states have not been resolved, and so their electors cannot be chosen.

The electoral college - whose job it is to formally nominate the next president - meets on 14 December this year. Electors must be put forward by each state for their winning candidate by then.

If the election results are still disputed and certain states can't decide which candidate to give their electors to, then it would be up to the US Congress to step in.

The US constitution imposes a final deadline - the term of the president (and vice-president) expires on 20 January at noon.

If Congress has been unable to choose the winner by then, there's a line of succession set out in law.

First in line is the Speaker of the House of Representatives, currently Nancy Pelosi, followed by the second highest ranking member of the Senate, currently Charles Grassley.

This has never happened before so it's unclear how, under these exceptional circumstances, this would work in practice.

What makes some states' votes count more than others? - S Robertson, Sussex, UK

Candidates tend to campaign in states where the result is uncertain - that's why people say the votes in these states ""count more"".

These places are known as battleground or swing states.

The US electoral system means that in all but two states, the margin of victory doesn't matter, as whoever gets the most votes wins all the electoral votes on offer in that state.

image copyright Getty Images image caption People waiting to vote in California

In states which are almost guaranteed to vote a certain way - like California (Democrat) or Alabama (Republican) - candidates have less incentive to campaign.

They'll put most effort into a handful of tight races, such as Florida and Pennsylvania, targeting voters that could go either way.

If postal votes that get counted several days after the election, change the final tally of a state from Trump to Biden or vice-versa, then what is the protocol for re-announcing a winner? - Charlie Etheridge, Kent, UK

There's no legal requirement to announce a winner on election night - this is done as a projection by major US media outlets.

The full count is never completed on the night - but enough votes are usually in to confirm a winner.

These are unofficial results which are certified only weeks later, when confirmed by state officials.

media caption Could postal voting upend the US election?

This year, the US media will likely be more cautious in calling a winner, as there are more postal votes and these take longer to count.

This could mean the leader on election night in some states could end up losing once all the votes - including postal ballots - are counted.

President Trump spoke early on Friday about the US election count, making a number of accusations of fraud for which he did not provide evidence.

We've fact-checked some of his claims.

Trump: ""I've been talking about mail-in voting for a long time. It's really destroyed our system. It's a corrupt system and it makes people corrupt.""

Mr Trump has posted more than 70 tweets casting doubt on mail-in voting, referencing voter fraud or ""rigged"" elections since April.

But there is no evidence the system is corrupt.

Electoral fraud is very rare in the United States - the rate is less than 0.0009%, according to a 2017 study by the Brennan Center for Justice. There's no evidence to suggest it's been a major issue at this election either.

The president himself has voted by post in the past. He lived outside the state he was registered in, Florida, and requested a postal vote.

This is known as an absentee ballot, which Mr Trump has said he is in favour of because he believes it has better safeguards.

But he has made a distinction with other forms of mail-in voting, such as when states automatically send out ballots to all registered voters.

Oregon and Utah have done so successfully in previous elections.

Trump: ""They mailed out tens of millions of unsolicited ballots without any verification measures.""

Registered voters in nine states (plus Washington DC) were automatically sent mail-in ballots without having to ask for them. Five of these states introduced this measure because of the coronavirus pandemic.

But eight of the nine states - Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, Washington, California, New Jersey, and Vermont - are not currently in contention.

All forms of postal voting have safeguards - such as authorities checking that ballots have come from a voter's registered address and requiring signatures on envelopes.

Voting by mail is not new - it has been used for many elections.

Trump: ""It's amazing how those mail-in ballots are so one-sided too.""

President Trump has repeatedly criticised plans to expand postal voting, saying - without real evidence - it was open to ""tremendous fraud.""

He urged Republican voters to turn up on the day, rather than using mail-in ballots.

There's evidence from the vote count that this is what has happened - Democratic voters favoured voting by post and Republicans voted on the day in person.

The count is not finished but in Pennsylvania, one estimate is that of more than 2.5 million postal votes received, nearly three times as many came from registered Democrats than from Republicans.

Trump: ""In Georgia, a pipe burst in a far away location, totally unrelated to the location of what was happening and they stopped counting for four hours.""

That's not true.

The pipe burst at State Farm Arena and affected a room where absentee ballots were being tabulated.

Here is the press release put out by the staff at the arena.

Trump: ""There are now only a few states yet to be decided in the presidential race. The voting apparatus of those states are run in all cases by Democrats.""

That's not true ""in all cases"".

In Georgia, which is yet to be decided, the governor and both houses of the legislature are Republican-controlled.

The secretary of state, who is in charge of the administration of the election, is Brad Raffensperger who is a Republican.

Here is a tweet from 2018 where Donald Trump endorses him.

Brad Raffensperger will be a fantastic Secretary of State for Georgia - will work closely with @BrianKempGA. It is really important that you get out and vote for Brad - early voting.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 26, 2018

To take another example, Nevada has a Republican secretary of state overseeing its election.

Trump: ""They wouldn't allow legally permissible observers.""

President Trump is talking about poll watchers. These are people inside polling stations who observe the counting of votes, with the aim of ensuring transparency.

These are allowed in most states, but they have to be registered before election day, usually affiliated with a party or a candidate, although rules vary from state to state.

President Trump has taken issue with a perceived lack of access for Republican observers in certain Democrat-run cities, such as Philadelphia and Detroit.

But poll watchers were allowed to observe the count in both cities.

The number of poll watchers allowed at a counting facility varies depending on its size. These limits are set out before election day.

In some areas numbers were restricted, in part to limit capacity due to coronavirus. There are also limits set to avoid intimidation.

In Detroit, more than 130 observers representing both the Democrats and Republicans were allowed inside the convention site.

The City Clerk Janice Winfrey said she wasn't aware of Republican observers being removed.

In Philadelphia, there was a viral video showing a certified poll watcher being turned away from a polling station, but as we reported, this was due to confusion over the rules and he was later allowed in.

Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar has said: ""Every candidate and every political party is allowed to have an authorised representative in the room observing the process. Some jurisdictions including Philly are also livestreaming, so you can literally watch their counting process.""

Trump: ""If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us. If you count the votes that came in late, we're looking to them very strongly, but a lot of votes came in late.""

President Trump is suggesting counting postal votes which arrive after election day is ""illegal"".

But late postal ballots can be counted in around half of US states - as long as they are postmarked by 3 November.

This includes the key states of Pennsylvania, Nevada and North Carolina where a winner is yet to be projected. The deadlines for how late a postal ballot can arrive varies from state to state.

Other states, such as Georgia and Arizona, don't count postal votes which arrive after election day.

In his speech, President Trump said in Pennsylvania late postal ballots were being counted ""without even postmarks or any identification whatsoever"".

The state's Supreme Court ruled late ballots with missing or illegible postmarks would be counted unless sufficient evidence ""demonstrates that it was mailed after election day"".

Every postal ballot goes through several steps to be verified, such as a signature and address check.

Trump: ""One major hub for counting ballots in Detroit covered up the windows again with large pieces of cardboard, and so they wanted to protect and block the counting area.""

Mr Trump is referring to the TFC Center in Detroit, Michigan - a battleground state.

On Wednesday, there were chaotic scenes when poll watchers claimed they were being blocked from the counting hall as windows were covered.

The City of Detroit's principal attorney, Lawrence Garcia, said in a statement: ""Some - but not all - windows were covered, because poll workers seated just inside those windows expressed concerns about people outside the center photographing and filming them and their work.""

Nigeria's Minister of Transport, Chibuike Amaechi, has dismissed allegations that the country offered its sovereignty as collateral when signing a $400m (£300m) loan with China.

The loan agreement - signed in 2014 with China's Export-Import Bank - contained a clause about Nigeria waiving its immunity on sovereignty if it defaults on repayment.

Lawmakers had questioned the intent of the clause and many in the country speculated that it had conceded the country's sovereignty to China, but Mr Amacehi has told the BBC that is not the case.

""The [Chinese] are saying that if we are unable to pay then we should go to court according to the agreement,"" he said.

He accused the country's main opposition party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP), of misinterpreting the clause to mean that the Chinese would appoint administrators to govern Nigeria if the country was unable to repay the loan."

The moment I decided who would get my vote,['Jessica Lussenhop'],"My act of rebellion

When Dr Ebun Ekunwe, 72, cast her ballot in 2016, she did so for Donald Trump. It was an act, she says, of “total rebellion” against the Democratic Party.

“I fervently supported Bernie Sanders,” she says. “I felt that the nomination was actually stolen from him. So we revolted against our own party.”

When Trump won, the retired doctor and pastor from Carrollton, Texas, hoped that he would rise to the occasion. Then, after white nationalists marched in Charlottesville in August 2017 and clashed violently with counter protesters, Trump made his now-infamous remark that “there were very fine people, on both sides”.

“For the purpose of healing the country, a leader does not go out and say that,” she says. “He has made the country about himself. He is reading the Constitution as ‘me, the president’ instead of ‘we, the people’.”

This year, even though she could vote by post, she wants to cast her ballot for Joe Biden in person.

“I want my voice to count,” she says. But doing so is not without risks for her in the pandemic - Ebun has sickle cell anaemia. She is managing her condition, but it will be on her mind as she casts her vote.

Ebun relies on Obamacare - another name for the 2010 healthcare law, which was designed to make medical cover affordable for the many Americans who had been priced out of the market. Without it, she says, she wouldn’t have been able to afford her cataract surgery

The pandemic has meant she has been unable to visit her doctor, and while her medical background enables her to take care of herself, she worries about others with pre-existing conditions. “I don’t know how they live from day-to-day,” she sighs. “They might be quietly, desperately saying, ‘Let nothing happen to my health’.”"
The boarding school ‘monster’ who always walked free,['Rebecca Woods'],"Maladjusted

Jack Mount was born in 1919 and grew up around the family farm near Barnsley in South Yorkshire. Living in the countryside with four brothers and three sisters was exhilarating, with days spent building tree-houses and dens, or catching rabbits and moles. In a memoir he wrote about his early life, Mount described the joy of watching Barnsley home games at Oakwell football ground, the smell of hops wafting over from the nearby brewery.

Then as World War Two loomed, a 17-year-old Mount lied about his age to join the Royal Signals. He started as a despatch rider, then became a wireless operator in France and Northern Ireland, where he met his first wife, Beth, before being posted to Italy.

It was clear from his autobiography - self-published to mark his 90th birthday - he enjoyed numerous extra-marital romances while away from home and he censored little about the many women he wooed, even including details of sleeping with a woman in Bologna while his wife was pregnant.

Curiously, he gave a copy to every family member, including Beth whom he had divorced in the early 1960s, and his grandchildren. When they questioned the gall he had in revealing his affairs, he was perplexed.

“He just said, ‘it was a long time ago, what’s wrong with you?’” his daughter Tricia recalls. “He couldn’t understand why we were so upset.”

Mount lied about his age to get into the Royal Signals Mount lied about his age to get into the Royal Signals

Mount, a slim man who was small in stature, left the Army determined to make something of himself and embarked upon a programme of reinvention. He moved Beth, their two sons and two daughters from Northern Ireland to Birmingham, completed a degree in child psychology, and, under the impression it was damaging his intellectual image, replaced his Yorkshire accent with the clipped sounds of an educated English gent.

After completing his teacher training, he worked in schools around Birmingham and became fixated with the idea of opening his own. When Hill House School in Shropshire came up for sale, he seized the opportunity. His new school, which he named Brookside, was opened up to almost every local authority in England and would cater for vulnerable children - or those deemed “maladjusted”. It was, at the time, a term used to describe highly dysfunctional behaviour - but some of the misdemeanors that landed youngsters in Mount’s care were, in fact, relatively minor.

Stephen Hesketh was considered one such child. His mother blamed his “unruly” behaviour on falling off a church roof and badly injuring his head, aged six. He says he doesn’t remember “being that bad as a kid”, but in 1968, he was taken from Liverpool to Brookside.

“My mum said to me, ‘if you don’t like it, just tell me and we’ll go’. I looked around and it seemed to me that the kids weren’t happy. I walked into a hall with big windows and I turned to my mum to say I didn’t want to stay.”

The last thing nine-year-old Stephen recalls seeing out of those windows was his mother driving away: “She just jumped in the car and left. I’ve never known whether to blame her or Mr Mount.”

Stephen was adopted by an American army captain in 1974 and has lived in the US ever since Stephen was adopted by an American army captain in 1974 and has lived in the US ever since

Stephen’s abuse began in much the same way as the others - while doing chores in the barn. He had gone to get hay when he heard his head teacher’s voice in the darkness.

“He asked another boy, ‘do you think he would do this?’ I ended up doing things I didn’t like. If you did, you got to have the horses and chickens. There were a lot of plusses to doing what he wanted you to do.”

He ran away three times - first to the police station, then by jumping on trains to Manchester and Liverpool. Every single time, Mount was called to take him back to Brookside.

“I thought, if I get home, mum will get the police, but she did not get the police, she called Mr Mount,” says Stephen, who later moved to Nevada when he was adopted by a US army captain. “I’d be in the back of the car knowing what was going to happen to me - he’d put me in the blazer room [and keep] me there for three to four days, maybe a week.”

On one occasion he was whipped with a bridle as punishment and passed out from the pain.

“For years I had nightmares.”

Both Stephen Hesketh and Steve Williams were approached while doing chores in the barn Both Stephen Hesketh and Steve Williams were approached while doing chores in the barn

One boy repeatedly fought off Mount’s advances and was regularly thrown in the blazer cupboard for his disobedience.

“The window had been nailed shut, but we learned we could get out if we lifted the floorboards and crawled under the door,” says Steve Williams, who later channelled his anger about how he had been treated into teaching martial arts.

“I ran away every chance I got. I made it clear that if Mount touched me I’d scream.”

Despite this, Mount persisted. On one occasion in the barn, he encouraged Steve to look at a pornographic magazine while performing a sex act in front of him. When the young boy refused to participate, he was knocked unconscious and awoke to find his headmaster abusing him. Later that night, Mount approached Steve in his dorm room - when he pretended to be asleep, he saw Mount assault a boy in a nearby bed.

“I can say that I saw what happened with my own eyes and he was 100% guilty.”

By 1974, police had been informed of more allegations against Mount. He went on trial in the December at Shrewsbury Crown Court, charged with indecent assault, attempted gross indecency, and incitement to commit gross indecency.

Records from the period are believed to have been destroyed due to the passage of time, but it is understood he was found not guilty of one charge and a retrial was ordered on the others. He was tried again at Stoke Crown Court two months later, in early 1975, but was cleared.

For the third time, he was free to return to Brookside, where he picked up the mantle of head teacher once more. This time, he opened up the school to girls."

The traditions that could save a nation’s forests,['Anthony Langat'],"In the aftermath of clashes over the evictions, I visit Nessuit village in the Mau Forest. What used to be a collection of vibrant timber and tin-roofed shops is now a heap of charred remains, with many people crowded nearby.

The Ogiek are a hunter-gatherer community that inhabit the Mau and Mount Elgon forests in Kenya and some parts of northern Tanzania. It is those living in the Mau Forest who have suffered the most from evictions from their ancestral land. Traditionally, the community allocated sections of forest to each of its 12 clans. The Ogiek People’s Development Program, a non-governmental organisation, explains that this allocation was to ensure that they “protect, conserve, preserve and utilise the forest in a suitable and sustainable manner”, detailed a document that marries the community’s customary laws to national and international laws. Like the Ogiek, the Sengwer – a larger community of about 33,000 people, within 21 clans – have documented their customary laws, which they vow to abide by if allowed to live in and conserve the forest.

“It is our way of life that preserves the forest and our way of life is guided by taboos that regulated how we interact with each other, the forest and its resources,” says Milka Chepkorir, a member of the Sengwer of Embobut. Elias Kimaiyo, who is also Sengwer, was part of a team that documented these customary laws. “We have put the by-laws in writing so that they can see the difference and appreciate the fact that they are inexpensive and easy to use,” Kimaiyo tells me.

Lina Taploson, an elder and a leader of the Ogiek residing in the forest-edge hamlet of Ndoswa in the Mau, describes a similar relationship between her community and the forest. “We lived in the forest, had our traditions and got everything including food and medicine from the forest,” she says.

Both communities’ lifestyles historically did not depend on cultivation, ensuring that no forest was cleared. “Women and children only picked dry sticks from the ground as it was taboo to cut a tree for the purpose of firewood,” says Chepkorir, of the Sengwer traditions. For medicine, they picked herbs from roots, barks or leaves. “One was required to only pick what was adequate for use only and not to stock the medicine,” says Chepkorir. “[We] were also required to cover the injured part of the root, back or branch where the medicine was harvested from to prevent the tree from drying up.”"
Asynchronous video interviews: The tools you need to succeed,['Peter Rubinstein'],"It may not feel remotely natural to sit in front of a computer screen and talk about yourself to an artificial prompt – but that’s exactly what many people could find themselves doing at their next job interview.

Since Covid-19 struck, hiring managers have had to think creatively about how to streamline their interview processes. With traditional face-to-face meetings on hold, the solution for some has come in the form of asynchronous video interviews, or AVIs, in which applicants film themselves answering a predetermined set of questions, with no human interviewer present.

In some cases, these recordings are then evaluated by a hiring manager, in others artificial intelligence and facial analysis software are used to assess candidates. Companies report that this type of interviewing can make the hiring process more efficient, but for applicants this job screening method − which may feel like a one-way Zoom conversation – can be uncomfortable.

As the pandemic continues to prevent in-person meetings, job seekers in manufacturing, retail and other industries are more likely to find themselves chatting with a bot at their next interview. Adapting to this format and understanding how to maximise the chance of a positive interview could be key to a successful job hunt.

Saving time

Even before the pandemic, AVIs were being used as the first stage of recruitment in the healthcare, pharmaceutical, tech, business and finance sectors, according to Carlos Flores, a career management specialist at Rutgers University in the US state of New Jersey. While exact statistics are hard to come by (AVIs have been adopted relatively recently by major companies and market reports don’t distinguish between them and face-to-face video interviews), experts say that for larger organisations with a national workforce of lower-skilled positions, AVIs have become a convenient way to skim through hundreds or thousands of applicants at a faster rate.

HireVue, one of the leading interview technology companies, says it is used today by more than 700 businesses, including a third of Fortune 500 companies, who collectively have conducted over 10 million interviews through its platform. Modern Hire, another interview technology platform, supported over 20 million assessments and interviews, and saw a 40% increase in users in 2019."
Europe’s city of dawdlers and loafers,['Will Buckingham'],"Bulgaria’s second city of Plovdiv is proud of its reputation for doing things its own way. As soon as you step off the bus from the capital of Sofia, you can feel the change in pace of life. People walk more slowly. They seem to have more time on their hands. The traffic is less hectic. As you walk to the city centre through the park, where old men gather to play chess and people lounge and chat in the shade of the old trees, Plovdiv immediately feels different. There’s a kind of insouciance to Plovdiv, something that is both immediately apparent and hard to put your finger on.

In the downtown Kapana district, people spill out of bars and cafes into the pedestrian streets. Under brightly painted murals on the walls, groups of young people hang out, flirt and check their phones. In the cafe by the Dzhumaya Mosque in the town centre, people sit for hours and sip cups of Turkish coffee. Even the cats in the cobbled streets of the old town seem more languid than elsewhere. They stretch and purr, then they roll over and go back to sleep. If you ask the people here why the city is so relaxed, they will tell you: Plovdiv, they will say, is “aylyak”.

The word “aylyak” is not much used outside of Plovdiv, even though it appears in Bulgarian dictionaries from the late 19th Century. It is a loan-word from the Turkish “aylaklık”, which means “idleness”, “dawdling” or “vagabondage”, and it’s rooted in the Turkish “aylık”, meaning “month”.

According to Yana Genova, director of the Sofia Literature and Translation House, the original meaning of aylyak was somebody hired to work month-by-month, who consequently knew what it was to have time on their hands. The verb that goes with aylyak is “bichim”, a derivative of the verb “bicha”, which means to strike, to whip, or to cut beams and boards from a tree trunk. The idea of striking, whipping or cutting is a reminder that aylyak is something active. If you want to practice aylyak, you have to slice out chunks of time for yourself. You must take the initiative to sever yourself from your daily concerns.

But whatever the origins of the word, in contemporary Plovdiv, aylyak has taken on its own meaning and significance, something not to be translated so much as lived. When you ask people to explain what it means, more often than not they will tell you a joke. The joke goes like this. A citizen of Plovdiv is hanging out with a Spanish visitor to the city. “What is aylyak?” the Spaniard asks. The Bulgarian thinks for a few moments, and then says, “It’s like your mañana, mañana, but without all the stress.”

In 2019, Plovdiv shared the title of European Capital of Culture with Matera in Italy. As a part of the City of Culture activities, one organisation – the Fire Theatre Mime Company, headed by Bulgarian actor, director and mime artist Plamen Radev Georgiev – ran a series of public consultations to explore aylyak in more depth. He wanted to know what aylyak is, what its origins are and how it became so closely associated with Plovdiv.

I caught up with Georgiev in a cafe in Sofia. He was born in Stara Zagora, about 80km to the north-east, and when he arrived in Plovdiv in 2018, it was as an outsider to the complexities of aylyak culture. “Our research was difficult,” he told me. “People asked why we were interested in aylyak. They said it wasn’t a value at all. It was just laziness.”

It’s like your mañana, mañana, but without all the stress

But through the public discussions, a broader picture emerged. Aylyak, people said, was about finding time. It was about sitting down for breakfast with friends and finding that you were still hanging out by nightfall. It was about taking pleasure in your environment. It was tied in with social status, with a kind of dandyish wandering the streets with nothing to do. And, on a deeper level – Georgiev called this “Zen aylyak” – it was to do with freedom of the soul. “Aylyak means that you can be engaged with the difficulties of life, but you remain safe from all life’s problems,” he said.

In Sofia, many people I spoke with were sceptical about aylyak, seeing it as nothing more than Capital of Culture branding or hipster marketing. I, too, was unconvinced. So, I caught the bus from Sofia to Plovdiv, to spend several days in the city and whip some aylyak of my own. In Plovdiv, I talked to Dr Svetoslava Mancheva, an anthropologist and director of ACEA Mediator, an organisation dedicated to linking communities and urban spaces. Originally from Kardzhali in the country’s south-west, Svetoslava is a self-confessed convert to aylyak. She has been living in Plovdiv for 10 years and has no intention of leaving. “Many people come to live here specifically because it is aylyak,” she said. Her colleague, Elitsa Kapusheva, told me she was brought up in Plovdiv but recently moved back from Berlin. She was glad to be home, she said: Berlin was good, but it wasn’t aylyak.

For Mancheva, aylyak is rooted in Plovdiv’s long history of cultural diversity. The historian Mary C Neuberger describes how the city was a thriving commercial hub in the 19th Century. Of all the cities in the Ottoman Empire, it was second only to Istanbul, and was home to Jews, Greeks, Bulgarians, Roma, Armenians and Slavs, crowded together in the streets and kafenes, or coffeehouses. Mancheva says that aylyak was a response to the challenges of living alongside strangers. “It’s about finding a space of your own in the city,” she said. “For me, the ground of aylyak is communication. You don’t need to like each other. What matters is the will to talk, the desire to understand.”

Historical accounts of Plovdiv’s coffeehouses in the 19th Century describe them as places where artisans and merchants mingled and where time passed slowly. The 19th-Century Bulgarian poet Hristo Danov wrote disapprovingly of how people spent all day in kafenes. People go to the kafene, he wrote, to smoke, talk, drink coffee, and “impatiently wait for the sun to set so they can move on to plum brandy”. Outsiders also picked up on Plovdiv’s uniquely relaxed feel. In his 1906 travel account, the British traveller John Foster Fraser was entranced by the pace of life in Plovdiv (then called Philippopolis):

“Picture the scene. A garden, lit with many lamps. Beneath the trees innumerable tables. At the tables sat ‘all Philippopolis,’ sipping coffee, drinking beer, toasting one another in litres of wine. At one end of the garden was a little stage. There was a Hungarian band which played rhapsodically… It was Sunday night and Philippopolis was enjoying itself.”

As I chatted to Mancheva and Kapusheva about aylyak, they returned again and again to one idea. Aylyak is about finding space. It is about finding space in a busy day to drink coffee. It is about finding nooks and crevices in the city – alleyways, small parks, benches – where you can hang out with friends, play music, drink beer or chat. It is about making space for others when you communicate. And, as Georgiev told me, it is about finding a space of freedom in the middle of life’s difficulties. For those who have developed the knack, like Mancheva and Kapusheva, there is no better way of living.

Aylyak means that you can be engaged with the difficulties of life, but you remain safe from all life’s problems

After several days in Plovdiv, I lost my scepticism and learned how to bichim aylyak. I strolled the streets. I took it easy. And strangely, I found I got no less done, only everything was done with less stress. Towards the end of my stay, I wondered whether Plovdiv has something to offer the rest of the world. I emailed the Bulgarian writer Filip Gyurov, who researched aylyak as a philosophy of life and as an alternative to economic growth as part of his MSc thesis at Lund University. “It is not all about the hustle and bustle of the big city, the need to buy the newest tech toy, the need to always climb the social ladder,” Gyurov wrote to me. “People, especially young people, have experienced the awful side effects of burnout. Hence the need to slow down, to de-grow, to live more in sync with nature and ourselves.”

On my last afternoon in Plovdiv, I sat in the cafe outside the Dzhumaya Mosque. I ordered a Turkish coffee and a portion of kyunefe, a dessert that originated in the Middle East and that, in a stroke of culinary brilliance, combines baklava and cheese. The coffee arrived with a small glass of sweet rosewater syrup that took the edge off the bitterness. Beside the mosque, underneath the rose bushes, a ginger and white cat dozed peaceably. I didn’t have my watch. I felt no need to check my phone. I had no appointments to keep. I drank my coffee and let the afternoon unfold, knowing that I had all the time in the world.

Election 2020 Live Updates: Biden takes the lead in key states as Trump promises legal fight,[],"Joe Biden appeared to close in on a victory in the 2020 presidential election against incumbent President Trump early Friday morning.

Biden was leading in Georgia and Nevada, and threatening to erase Trump's gains in Pennsylvania.

Still, both campaigns are projecting confidence that the increasingly narrow presidential race will end in their favor as the Trump team moves forward with legal challenges in several states.

Michigan GOP chairwoman says software glitch tallied thousands of Republican votes as Democrat,[],"President Trump’s supporters are pointing to a small Michigan county as evidence that vote-counting software used in the state may undercut Trump’s number of votes — as the Trump campaign fends off the appearance of inevitable defeat.

Republicans point out that in northern Antrim County, thousands of votes were counted in error for Biden, and for Democratic Sen. Gary Peters instead of GOP candidate John James.

Biden is ahead by 146,123 votes in Michigan with 98 percent of ballots counted, and the Associated Press and major news networks declared him the winner.

Michigan GOP Chairwoman Laura Cox said at a Friday press conference that “in Antrim County, ballots were counted for Democrats that were meant for Republicans, causing a 6,000 vote swing against our candidates. The county clerk came forward and said, ‘tabulating software glitched and caused a miscalculation of the votes.'”

JUSTICE ALITO: MAIL-IN BALLOTS RECEIVED AFTER ELECTION DAY IN PENNSYLVANIA MUST BE KEPT SEPARATE

Cox said that “since then, we have now discovered that 47 counties used this same software in the same capacity,” or more than half of Michigan’s 83 counties. She urged those counties to “closely examine their results for similar discrepancies.” Trump’s campaign circulated her remarks on Twitter.

The Detroit Free Press reports that Antrim County uses Dominion Voting Systems equipment. Results are stored on computer cards at precincts, then uploaded to another computer by county election officials.

Antrim County Clerk Sheryl Guy, a Republican, told the Free Press that it’s unclear if human error or a glitch caused the error, which was discovered because a Democratic wins were incongruous with the county’s conservative leanings. A manual review confirmed the error.

University of Michigan computer science professor J. Alex Halderman, a voting machine expert, told the Free Press that “it’s plausibly human error, but if a simple screw-up could cause these problems, that sounds like a technical design flaw.”

“It’s natural to wonder whether similar problems could have occurred in other jurisdictions that use the same machine. Fortunately, even if the county hadn’t noticed, this would have been caught and corrected during Michigan’s normal canvassing procedures, when they compare the results to the paper tapes from the machines,” he added.

A Michigan judge on Thursday tossed out a lawsuit from the Trump campaign to halt the counting of ballots in the Wolverine State, ruling that the vote count had already ended — in Biden’s favor.

Trump won Michigan by just 10,704 votes in 2016 against Hillary Clinton, and Biden boasted of his apparently wider lead in Wednesday remarks, when the state’s race was still tighter.

“In Michigan, we lead by over 35,000 votes, and it is growing, a substantially bigger margin that President Trump won Michigan in 2016,” Biden said.

Trump’s path to a second term appeared bleak Friday, with unofficial vote counts in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania tilting toward Biden. If those results hold, Biden will become president-elect."
"Nevada: More than 120,000 mail-in, provisional ballots in Clark County still need to be counted","['Vandana Rambaran', 'Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News', 'Politics At Foxnews.Com. She Can Be Found On Twitter']","There are still more than 120,000 total ballots that need to be counted in Nevada's Clark County, where the majority of uncounted votes reside, officials said Friday.

Clark County Registrar of Voters Joseph Gloria said at a press conference on Friday that at least 300 people are involved in the counting process and are working to enter some 63,262 ballots into their system by Sunday.

NEVADA GOP CITES VOTER-FRAUD CLAIMS IN CRIMINAL REFERRAL TO AG BARR

Most of these ballots were mail-in votes and don't include cured or provisional ballots or other absentee ballots that are still coming in through the postal service.

An additional 60,000 provisional ballots, cast electronically and in-person on Election Day, still need to be reviewed and it's unclear how many will actually go towards a final tally, Gloria said.

As of Friday morning, 241 ballots were received in the mail that also needs to be tallied.

He added that the state has up to Nov. 12 to cure ballots-- a process by which election officials will identify issues such as missing witness signatures or voter signature irregularities, and give voters the opportunity to rectify it so their ballots don't get thrown out.

NEVADA DEADLINE FOR ACCEPTING BALLOTS NOW NOV. 10, NEARLY 200K BALLOTS REMAIN TO BE COUNTED: OFFICIALS

""We're not interested in moving as fast as we can. We want to be accurate,"" Gloria said, responding to criticism that the closely watched county, where about 90% of the uncounted votes in Nevada reside, is moving too slow in processing the votes.

Nevada is one of three states still in play that could sway the outcome of the contentious presidential election.

Democratic nominee Joe Biden only needs six more electoral votes to amass the 270 needed to clinch victory to the White House. Biden is leading President Trump by a little over 20,000 votes in Nevada, which holds six electoral votes. With 87% of votes tallied, Biden has 627,104 votes, while Trump has 606,967.

Trump's camp has filed several lawsuits in battleground states including Nevada, Georgia, and Pennsylvania.

In the Peach State, Trump's lawsuit claims over 3,000 ineligible ballots were cast and that they have the evidence to prove it, though no such evidence has been made available yet.

But Gloria said Friday that the GOP lawsuit ""is based on something that happens regularly,"" in the state of Nevada.

""You don't have to live here to be eligible to vote here,"" he said, pointing out that hundreds of military personnel, government representatives, and students all live outside of the state but are still eligible to vote in Nevada.

""It's not unusual here at all,"" Gloria said.

The lawsuit looks to halt the counting of some mail-in ballots in Clark County and also appealed to have greater observer access to the vote-counting system."
Why is North Carolina taking so long to count votes?,[],"Counting votes can be a bit slower in North Carolina because the state allows more time, compared to other states, to count absentee and provisional ballots.

State law dictates individual counties have until Nov. 13 to report results from ballots tied to Tuesday’s election. But county election boards must also stick to a strict meeting schedule that is outlined by state law. And ballots are not counted until those meetings.

Nine county election boards met for their scheduled meetings to count absentee ballots for the first time since Election Day.

“This is the process we always go through and that we must go through under state law,” said Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the Tate Board of Elections in a statement released Friday afternoon.

State law requires county elections boards to schedule post-election absentee board meetings at least two weeks before Election Day, so the boards cannot meet sooner to count addition ballots. A county board cannot modify the meeting schedule after the election.

And ballots will continue to be counted as they arrive at the county boards as long as they are postmarked on or before Election until the Nov. 13 deadline.

Most of the state’s 100 county boards won’t count ballots until their post-election meetings next Thursday or Friday.

But nine counties that met Friday to count about 4,300 ballots could show whether absentee ballots might break for Democrats or Republicans.

In Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, election officials spent Friday evening reviewing a few thousand ballots. A small room was packed with media, elections officials and a handful of observers. The results are then reported to the North Carolina State Board of Elections, which has posted unofficial results since the polls first closed Tuesday evening.

As of Friday morning, North Carolina reported a potential 99,000 absentee ballots that remain outstanding.

These are ballots that were sent out, but could have been mailed back, never returned, or include people who chose to discard their ballot and vote in person on Election Day.

“The number of these ballots ultimately returned will be less than 99,000 because some voters cast their ballot in person on Election Day and others likely did not vote at all,"" a spokesperson for the state Board of Elections said in a news release.

North Carolina Republicans have called on the state to move faster, as President Trump and Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., have maintained leads in their respective contests.

The campaign manager for Cal Cunningham, the Democratic opponent in the Senate race, rejected Tillis’ claim he had won a second term.

“The State Board of Elections is continuing to count ballots, and we plan to allow that process to be carried out, so every voter can have their voice heard,"" said Devan Barber."
"Trump warns Dems aiming to take the Senate, doubles down on final victory","['Edmund Demarche', 'Edmund Demarche Is A Senior News Editor For Foxnews.Com. Follow Him On Twitter']","President Trump took to Twitter early Friday to warn his followers that Democrats have their sights set on winning the Senate, but vowed that Republicans would ultimately prevail, despite what looked like an uphill climb.

“So now the Democrats are working to gain control of the U.S. Senate through their actions on John James, David Perdue, and more. Would End the Filibuster, “Life”, 2A, and would Pack and Rotate the Court. Presidency becomes even more important. We will win!” Trump tweeted.

GOP STATE LAWMAKER SAYS VOTERS IN PENNSYLVANIA 'NO LONGER FEEL SECURE' ABOUT ELECTIONS

The president was referring to Perdue’s closely watched Senate race in Georgia against Jon Ossoff, a Democrat who has been making gains on the Republican's vote count. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that it appeared the two were headed to a runoff.

Fox News had projected an even split with both Democrats and Republicans holding 48 Senate seats after the election. Along with North Carolina's Senate race, Georgia's will be critical for each side achieving control of the upper chamber of Congress.

James' campaign ended in a narrow defeat in what turned out to be one of the tightest Senate races in the country against incumbent Michigan Democrat Sen. Gary Peters.

James said in a statement, “While Senator Peters is currently ahead, I have deep concerns that millions of Michiganders may have been disenfranchised by a dishonest few who cheat. While not everyone wins in an election, voters must be confident that the election was fair and honest. Failure to do so, is the end of democracy.”

Trump’s tweet came as some of his supporters held protests outside ballot-counting centers in key battleground states.

On Thursday, Trump held a news conference at the White House where he vowed he would not “allow corruption to steal” the election. He’s been criticized by Democrats and some in his own party over his claims of widespread voter fraud.

“This is a case where they’re trying to steal an election, trying to rig an election,” he said.

TRUMP CLAIMS DEMS ARE TRYING TO 'STEAL' ELECTION, SAYS HE'LL WIN IF 'LEGAL VOTES' ARE COUNTED

Trump has been vocal in his opposition to mail-in ballots. The day prior to the election, the president criticized the Supreme Court decision that allowed ballots to be counted for up to three days after the election, according to the Financial Times.

“The night of — as soon as that election is over — we are going in with our lawyers,” Trump said.

Democrats and some Republicans criticized the president's remarks prior to the votes all being counted.

Republican Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland tweeted that there was ""no defense for the President’s comments tonight undermining our Democratic process. America is counting the votes, and we must respect the results as we always have before. No election or person is more important than our Democracy.""

Pennsylvania Democrats ask Supreme Court to wait before taking up ballot deadline extension case,"['Tyler Olson', ""Shannon Bream Currently Serves As Anchor Of Fox News Channel'S"", 'Fnc']","Democrats in Pennsylvania on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to hold off any action on a petition from Republicans in the state that argues the tribunal should strike down a three-day deadline extension for Pennsylvania mail ballots sent by Election Day to be received by elections boards.

The filing by the state Democratic Party on Thursday was in response to a motion by the Trump campaign to join the state GOP in its effort to overturn the deadline extension, which was implemented by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Republicans argue that the state supreme court overstepped its authority because the U.S. Constitution gives the power to set up state election law to state legislatures.

Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, in a statement last week backed the Supreme Court's refusal to take up the case, saying there was not enough time to issue a ruling before the election. But they left the door open to decide the case post-election and said it is ""likely"" the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling is unconstitutional.

WHERE THE RACE STANDS: BIDEN ERASES TRUMP LEAD IN GEORGIA AND PENNSYLVANIA, NEARS 270 ELECTORAL VOTES

""There is no reason for the Court to expedite consideration of the pending petitions, let alone to grant certiorari at this time,"" the Pennsylvania Democratic Party said in its brief, urging the justices to exercise further patience.

""Because this Court may well not need to hear and decide these cases, it would be premature for this Court to rule on the motion to intervene,"" the state party also said.

As of Friday morning, Joe Biden leads in states like Georgia and Nevada, putting into question whether or not Pennsylvania would become unnecessary on the path to 270 electoral votes -- the number needed to win the presidency. And as Biden took a lead in the Pennsylvania vote count Friday, either he or Trump may end up winning the election in that state by a margin higher than the number of post-Election Day ballots that are even received, something the state Democratic Party acknowledged in its brief.

""Even if there were a legal basis for refusing to count any such ballots (and there is not), no reason exists to assume that the number of ballots received in that window would be large enough to be decisive in the races for President and House of Representatives,"" the party said.

The Pennsylvania Democratic Party did not oppose allowing the Trump campaign to join the suit. Meanwhile, the office of Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar argued against letting the Trump campaign join the suit by state Republicans.

Whether or not the Trump campaign can join the suit is unlikely to affect the outcome, though the Trump campaign is touting its efforts to join the state Republicans as part of its public relations strategy promoting some post-election lawsuits it's filed.

"Trump remains defiant in election battle, prepares to take fight to courts: report",['Brie Stimson'],"President Trump has been brushing aside advice from some campaign advisers who are privately urging him to prepare for a possible election loss, according to a report.

Instead, the president has remained defiant, with his legal team preparing to mount legal challenges in several battleground states, over claims of fraud in connection with the voting.

While aides have advised the president that lawsuits are unlikely to wipe out Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s leads in uncalled states like Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia, Trump has seemed uninterested in moving toward a concession, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing several sources speaking on condition of anonymity.

Trump remained behind Biden in the electoral count by early Saturday and appeared to have an increasingly small path to reelection as votes continued to be counted.

BIDEN TRANSITION TEAM'S WORK UNDERWAY, NOT WAITING FOR WINNER TO BE DECLARED

The president made allegations with little evicence of widespread fraud this week and said the election was being stolen from him when mail-in ballots counts began to favor Biden.

The campaign’s legal efforts have scored some gains – including an order by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito that any Pennsylvania ballots postmarked by Election Day but received afterward should be segregated and counted separately – but none have succeeded in changing the vote count in the president’s favor.

Some of the president's advisers told the Journal they believe a Trump loss is an eventuality.

“They have a no-stone-unturned strategy,” one adviser said, “but at some point, you have to wonder when enough is enough.”

Aides are also urging Trump to stay on script and to focus on his final months in office.

TRUMP DECRIES LEAD THAT 'MIRACULOUSLY' DISAPPEARED, URGES BIDEN NOT TO WRONGFULLY CLAIM WHITE HOUSE

One adviser told the Journal the president’s mood is “black,” and he has spent much of his time on the phone telling aides to do everything in their power to avoid an electoral loss.

Publicly, Trump’s team and many Republicans have supported his claims and called for any election regularities to be investigated.

Earlier this week, the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., accused “virtually all of the ‘2024 GOP hopefuls’"" of a ""lack of action.""

“They have a perfect platform to show that they’re willing & able to fight but they will cower to the media mob instead,” he tweeted.

Son Eric Trump on Friday alleged that the Democratic National Committe was behind ""spamming"" of the Trump campaign's voter fraud hotline, claiming it was a bid to ""bog down the thousands of complaints we are receiving!""

Despite a lack of evidence of mass voter fraud, the president maintains that votes that have been counted after Election Day are “illegal.”

State officials have said that in-person ballots were counted first on Election Day and tended to lean heavily in favor of Trump. Mail-in ballots submitted before or by Nov. 3 are now being tallied. Mail-in ballots have favored Biden.

“I easily WIN the Presidency of the United States with LEGAL VOTES CAST,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “The OBSERVERS were not allowed, in any way, shape, or form, to do their job and therefore, votes accepted during this period must be determined to be ILLEGAL VOTES. U.S. Supreme Court should decide!”

The tweet was flagged for misinformation by Twitter, along with a dozen others since Tuesday – a move the president took issue with in a separate tweet Friday.

“Twitter is out of control, made possible through the government gift of Section 230!”

""We had a very good [Election] Day,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Friday. ""Most pundits thought we were going to lose the Senate. But we have not yet actually secured the majority. That will be determined in Georgia where we will have two-runoffs.""

The two senate races in Georgia are headed for run-off elections on Jan. 5 because it appears none of the candidates received above 50 percent of the vote. Democrats will likely need to win both of them to retake the majority for the first time since 2014.

The balance of power in the Senate has not been called by the Fox News Decision Desk as of Friday afternoon.

Democrats, who had just two incumbents in jeopardy, so far have a net gain of one seat in the Senate. They flipped seats in Colorado and Arizona but lost Democratic incumbent Sen. Doug Jones in Alabama, according to Fox News Decision Desk race calls.

That puts the balance of power at 48 for Democrats and 48 for Republicans, so far.

Four races with Republican incumbents remain undecided in Alaska, North Carolina, and two seats are still undecided in Georgia. Republicans are holding the lead in Alaska and North Carolina, which would bring their numbers up to 50-48 if successful.

Then all attention will be on the two remaining races in Georgia, which will be decided two months from now and after the next Congress is sworn in.

Republicans would need to win just one race in Georgia to secure the majority. But if Democrats win them both, they'd secure 50 seats in the Senate. Assuming Joe Biden wins the White House, then Kamala Harris would serve as the tie-breaking 51st vote in the Senate to give Democrats the edge.

Here's a look at where the state of the Senate stands as of 1 p.m. Nov. 6.

Undecided races

Georgia

Control of the Senate looks like it will hinge on Georgia in January 2021. The special election to decide who serves the remainder of former Sen. Johnny Isakson's term is headed to a run-off on Jan. 5 between Democrat Raphael Warnock and GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who was appointed to the seat after Isakson's resignation for health reasons.

Both sides are also bracing for the second race to require a run-off between Republican Sen. David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff. If one candidate secures over 50 percent, he'll win outright. If not, a rematch between Perdue and Ossoff would take place on Jan. 5, 2021, without the Libertarian candidate Shane Hazel on the ballot.

Sen. David Perdue (R) vs. Jon Ossoff (D)

In the final days of the contentious election, Perdue canceled the debate with Ossoff to attend President Trump’s campaign rally in Georgia. Ossoff was hammering Perdue on his health care voting record. During their last debate, Ossoff labeled Perdue a “crook” who has been accused of insider trading, while Perdue claimed Ossoff has problematic ties to a Hong Kong-based media company.

Under Georgia law, if one candidate secures over 50 percent, he'll win outright. If not, a rematch between Perdue and Ossoff would take place on Jan. 5, 2021, without the Libertarian candidate Shane Hazel on the ballot.

Votes are still being counted but both sides are planning for the race to continue into overtime.

With 98 percent of the vote in, Perdue was at 49.84% and Ossoff at 47.85%

Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) vs. Raphael Warnock (D)

Loeffler, the wealthiest U.S. senator, is looking to retain the seat she inherited after Sen. Johnny Isakson resigned in 2019 for health reasons. In a 20-person special election, Loeffler defeated her biggest GOP challenger, Rep. Doug Collins, to advance to the run-off election. She secured 26% of the vote to Collins' 20%.

Democrat Raphael Warnock, a pastor and civil rights leader, led the crowded field with 33% of the vote with 98 percent of the ballots counted.

LOEFFLER, WARNOCK HEADED TO RUNOFF IN GEORGIA AS COLLINS CONCEDES

As the top-two finishers, Loeffler and Warnock will now face-off on Jan. 5.

North Carolina

Sen. Thom Tillis (R) vs. Cal Cunningham (D)

The swing state is too close to call for either the presidential election or the Senate.

Tillis, a first-term senator, had trailed Cunningham in polls throughout the race. However, Republicans seized on a sex scandal involving Cunningham and the wife of a military veteran and argued that he is unfit for office.

Tillis quickly claimed victory, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said afterward it was too early to call the race but remained optimistic Tillis would prevail when the votes were counted.

With 93 percent of the vote in, Tillis was ahead 49%-47%.

Alaska

Sen. Dan Sullivan (R) vs. Al Gross (I)

Sullivan, a first-term senator, appears to be fending off a challenge from orthopedic surgeon Al Gross, an independent who is running with Democratic support.

Sullivan was leading with 62% of the vote, compared to Gross at 32%, but the race has not been called because only about half the ballots have been counted.

Flip from Blue to Red

Alabama

Sen. Doug Jones (D) vs. Tommy Tuberville (R)

Jones failed to retain his seat in a red state that overwhelmingly supported President Trump’s re-election. Tommy Tuberville, the former head football coach at Auburn University, is a local legend and defeated former Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the GOP primary.

REPUBLICAN TOMMY TUBERVILLE DEFEATS SEN. DOUG JONES IN ALABAMA

Tuberville had won 60% of the vote compared to Jones' 40% with 99 percent of ballots counted.

Flip from Red to Blue

Arizona

Sen. Martha McSally (R) vs. Mark Kelly (D)

McSally, who was appointed to the Senate in 2019 to replace the late Sen. John McCain, lost the special election to Kelly, a former astronaut and moderate Democrat, Fox News has projected. McSally, who appeared alongside President Trump at several of his recent campaign rallies, has not conceded.

DEMOCRAT MARK KELLY SECURES ARIZONA SENATE SEAT, OUSTS INCUMBENT MCSALLY

Gardner faced an uphill battle to retain his seat in a state that Biden carried. Hickenlooper, the former governor, launched his Senate bid after a failed attempt to secure the Democratic presidential nomination.

SEN. CORY GARDNER IS OUT IN COLORADO

Hickenlooper beat Gardner 53-44% with 92 percent of the vote in.

Blue state remaining Blue

Michigan

Sen. Gary Peters (D) vs. John James (R)

Peters, a first-term senator and former congressman, prevailed in a very competitive race against James, a businessman and Iraq combat veteran, Fox News has projected.

President Trump smashed the so-called blue wall in 2016 by winning Michigan. But Democrats worked hard to prevent a repeat and Michigan returned to the blue column in favor of Joe Biden and Peters.

DEMOCRAT GARY PETERS WINS FIGHT TO HOLD ONTO BATTLEGROUND MICHIGAN SENATE SEAT

With 99 percent of the vote in, Peters won just under 50% and James had just over 48%. James has not conceded.

Red States remaining Red

Iowa

Sen. Joni Ernst (R) vs. Theresa Greenfield (D)

Ernst prevailed in her quest for a second term over Greenfield, a real estate developer who campaigned on greater health care access, and support for local farmers amid the U.S.-China trade dispute.

IOWA SEN. JONI ERNST HOLDS OFF DEM CHALLENGER GREENFIELD TO WIN REELECTION

Ernst had 52% of the vote compared to Greenfield's 45% with 99 percent of the vote in.

Maine

Sen. Susan Collins (R) vs. Sara Gideon (D)

Collins, a centrist Republican who sometimes breaks with her party, was elected to fifth term to the Senate --- something no modern-day Maine politician has ever done.

The state voted for Biden, but rewarded Collins for her independent streak by picking her over Gideon, who said Collins has aligned herself more closely with the Trump administration to the detriment of state residents.

SUSAN COLLINS CLAIMS VICTORY IN MAINE SENATE RACE, SARA GIDEON CONCEDES

Collins was up 51-42% with 99 percent of the vote in.

Montana

Sen. Steve Daines (R) vs. Gov. Steve Bullock (D)

Daines prevailed against Bullock, the Democratic governor who unsuccessfully ran for president.

Daines earned 55% of the vote compared to 45% for Bullock with 99 percent of the vote counted.

South Carolina

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) vs. Jaime Harrison (D)

A fixture on the national political scene, Graham won his most competitive Senate race ever against former Democratic Party official Jaime Harrison, who raised a record amount of money to flip the seat. Harrison touted his personal history of overcoming poverty in a campaign pitch to help middle-class families in South Carolina and pursue expanded health care coverage. Graham, meanwhile, returned to the national spotlight in recent weeks for successfully presiding over the confirmation hearings for Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.

LINDSEY GRAHAM DEFENDS SENATE SEAT IN SC, BEATING OUT DEM OPPONENT DESPITE RECORD-BREAKING FUNDRAISING

Graham had 55% of the vote to Harrison's 44% with 94 percent of the vote counted.

Texas

Sen. John Cornyn (R) vs. MJ Hegar (D)

Cornyn held his seat since 2002 and prevailed once again in a competitive race against Hegar, a Harley-Davidson riding Air Force veteran. The Democratic Party has been adamant that Texas could vote for Biden in the presidential election, fueling speculation for a similar upset victory in the Senate race, but both of those hopes were dashed in the Lone Star state.

SEN. JOHN CORNYN REELECTED IN TEXAS AS DEMOCRAT CHALLENGER HEGAR CONCEDES

Cornyn won 54-44% with 84 percent of the vote in.

Roger Marshall (R) vs. Barbara Bollier (D)

Democrats saw an opening in traditional red Kansas with the retirement of GOP Sen. Pat Roberts. But Marshall, a congressman, retained the open seat for Republicans against a challenge from Bollier, a state senator.

Marshall won 54-42% with 99 percent of the vote in.

""They're being fed a line of crap, yes,"" Brooks said. ""And if that's all you're hearing and Uncle Joe and Uncle Bob say the same thing and Cousin Mary say the same thing ... I don't think it's that people are dumb. I think it's that people, you know, how do we know what we know? We know what we know because people we trust talk to us and if everybody we trust is being fed the same s---, then s--- in, s--- out.""

Maher then pointed to President Trump's expanded support among Black voters in reported exit polls.

""Trump did a lot better with the Black vote than he did last time,"" Maher told Nance.

""We don't really know that,"" Nance pushed back. ""We don't really know that because the exit polling we saw were people who showed up at the polls. There's that 100 million Americans who actually voted by mail so I'm not exactly sure if I buy that. And that's sort of in the same thread of propaganda that we generally get from conservatives.""

""Well, this I read in the New York Times,"" Maher shot back. ""It's not a conservative paper. ... So you just deny the premise?""

""No,"" Nance responded with a smirk.

""Well, maybe you're right. That's true, the mail-in ballots, maybe we don't know,"" Maher conceded.

""We don't know,"" Nance agreed.

After Brooks suggested that Trump voters have succumbed to the far-right's ""information warfare,"" Maher pushed back against her as well.

""Or maybe people just see the world differently,"" Maher said. ""I think he's a terrible leader but I don't think that it's terrible that there's diversity in the Black community. Or in any community.""

Later on, during his closing monologue, Maher appeared to further repudiate Nance's characterization of Trump voters by calling for unity.

""Let's all stop seeing each other as deplorable,"" Maher pleaded to viewers."
Joe Biden's election update speech draws celebrity reactions,['Nate Day'],"One day after President Trump did the same, Joe Biden appeared before the nation to share his view of the state of the 2020 presidential election.

As votes continue to be counted, Biden took leads in both Pennsylvania and Georgia -- though both states had yet to call their races. A handful of other states' races remained uncalled as well.

During his Thursday address, Trump drew ire from celebrities as he continued to claim widespread voter fraud.

This time around, stars took to Twitter to praise for Biden -- as a path to victory appeared to emerge for the Democratic nominee.

CELEBRITIES REACT TO TRUMP'S ELECTION UPDATE

""How bizzare is it to hear a sane man after these last 4 years,"" wrote John Cusack. ""It’s almost weird to hear the sound of coherence.""

"Trump decries lead that 'miraculously' disappeared, urges Biden not to 'wrongfully claim' White House",['Morgan Phillips'],"President Trump on Friday night decried his initial lead in the presidential race that he watched ""miraculously disappear as the days went by"" and urged his opponent Joe Biden not to claim victory in the election.

""Joe Biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the President,"" Trump tweeted. ""I could make that claim also. Legal proceedings are just now beginning!""

Biden has been gaining votes in crucial battleground states like Pennsylvania and Georgia, where Trump had early leads because of how each of the candidates' supporters chose to vote -- Trump supporters tended to vote in person, and those votes were counted first, and Biden supporters tended to vote by mail.

""I had such a big lead in all of these states late into election night, only to see the leads miraculously disappear as the days went by,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Perhaps these leads will return as our legal proceedings move forward!""

Democratic nominee Biden has not claimed the office, but he has predicted victory once the final votes are counted.

On Thursday, Trump told reporters: ""If you only count the legal votes, I easily win.""

Earlier Friday, as Biden's lead grew, Trump vowed to keep “fighting,” saying he will use “every aspect of the law.”

“We believe the American people deserve to have full transparency into all vote counting and election certification, and that this is no longer about any single election,” the president said in a statement Friday. “This is about the integrity of our entire election process.”

The Trump campaign has filed a litany of lawsuits alleging procedural violations and illegal voting in nearly every state that has yet to report its final results.

ELECTION 2020 LEGAL BATTLES UNDER WAY AS JUDGES WEIGH IN ON TRUMP LAWSUITS IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES

In Nevada, the campaign is suing to stop the counting of what it calls ""illegal votes,"" claiming to have evidence that people who are deceased and nonresidents have cast ballots in the 2020 election.

The Trump campaign alleges there are ""tens of thousands"" of people who voted in Nevada who are no longer state residents. It said it is not seeking to stop the vote, but rather ensure that every “legal“ vote is counted and that no “illegal” votes are counted. Biden leads in Nevada by about 22,600 votes, with 87 percent of precincts reporting.

The campaign and Republicans are focusing much energy in Pennsylvania, where today the state GOP asked the Supreme Court to step in and ensure ballots received after Nov. 3 are segregated from those received by Election Day. Pennsylvania is allowing ballots that are postmarked by Nov. 3 but arrive up to three days later to be counted.

The petition will go to Justice Samuel Alito, but the state was already segregating these ballots before the emergency appeal was filed.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN BALLOT COUNTING LAWSUITS: WHAT TO KNOW

On Oct. 28, the high court said it wouldn’t fast-track an appeal to block vote-counting after Nov. 3. Alito had written a statement conceding ""there is simply not enough time"" to issue a pre-election decision.

The court's refusal to issue a fast-track decision does not mean it won't rule in the case. The petition asking for the court's review remains before the justices.

Therefore, Alito could ask the state to respond to the emergency appeal and set a deadline for those briefs to be filed. An order is expected in the coming days.

The Supreme Court could step in to overturn the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the ruling that essentially changed state election law, and void votes after they have been cast in a state that has the potential to decide the presidential election, which is what Republicans are hoping.

The Trump campaign is also asking the court to stop allowing voters to provide late missing proof of identification on Nov. 9, rather than the 12.

On Thursday a judge ordered the county boards of elections to segregate ballots for which ID was validated by Nov. 9 and ballots with valid IDs between Nov. 9 and 12.

The segregated ballots “shall not be counted until further order of this court.”

However, an appellate court in the state handed the Trump campaign a win Thursday by allowing elections watchers to stand as close as 6 feet away from vote counters to ensure a fair process in Philadelphia.

Still, the Trump campaign alleged that ""Democrat"" elections workers were blocking their access to vote-counting operations.

""On the heels of this ruling, Democrats are blatantly defying the law. These Democrats are blocking the doors to the counting center and pushing our observers outside the building while they continue to count votes inside with zero transparency. What are they hiding?"" Trump campaign attorney Justin Clark said in a statement.

A federal judge denied the campaign's request to stop the vote in Philadelphia over observer access, instead urging the sides to forge an agreement.

Eastern District of Pennsylvania Judge Paul Diamond scheduled an emergency hearing over the suit, before pushing the parties to reach agreement during recess, then ruling that each side could have 60 observers in the vote-counting room as long as they could follow social distancing and must stay behind a barrier.

The campaign had filed an emergency injunction to stop the vote count Thursday afternoon on the grounds of alleged due-process violations, accusing the county Board of Elections of ""intentionally refusing to allow any representatives and poll watchers for President Trump and the Republican Party"" while they continue to count votes.

Earlier, Clark said the campaign had sued to stop elections officials in Pennsylvania from what they characterize as ""hiding the ballot counting and processing from our Republican poll observers.""

Clark said that in Philadelphia and elsewhere elections officials had forced their elections watchers to stand 25-plus feet away to observe the counting process.

"Georgia Senate race: Perdue, Ossoff head to runoff after highly competitive campaign",['Morgan Phillips'],"Georgia’s Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. David Perdue and his Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff will head to a runoff race in January after neither candidate received more than 50 percent of the votes in Tuesday’s election.

Under the Peach State’s unusual election laws, candidates must receive an outright majority to win. Otherwise, the top two competitors head into a runoff race.

A final vote count left Perdue with 49.8% of the votes and Ossoff with 47.8%. Third-party candidate Shane Hazel took 2.32%, according to the Fox News Decision Desk.

A former Fortune 500 CEO, Perdue was first elected to the Senate in 2014.

Ossoff was the Democratic candidate in the most expensive House race in history for Georgia’s 6th Congressional District. Republican Karen Handel defeated him in a runoff, 51.8 percent to 48.2.

Perdue, 70, was squarely ahead of Ossoff, 33, until the final leg of the race, when Ossoff made headway, leaving the two neck-and-neck.

Both teams expressed confidence that they would win the runoff.

“There is one thing we know for sure: Senator David Perdue will be re-elected to the U.S. Senate and Republicans will defend the majority. Perdue will finish this election in first place with substantially more votes than his Democrat opponent,” Perdue’s Senate campaign manager Ben Fry said in a statement.

“It is clear that more Georgians believe that David Perdue's positive vision for the future direction of our country is better than Chuck Schumer's radical, socialist agenda. There's only one candidate in this race who has ever lost a runoff, and it isn't David Perdue,” he continued.

The Ossoff campaign expressed confidence Georgians would elect him for his stance on health care and to “put the interests of working families and small businesses ahead of corporate lobbyists.”

“We are confident that Jon Ossoff’s historic performance in Georgia has forced Senator David Perdue to continue defending his indefensible record of unemployment, disease, and corruption,” Ossoff campaign manager Ellen Foster said in a statement.

WHO IS DAVID PERDUE: 8 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE GEORGIA SENATOR

Perdue pulled out of the final debate last week after a clip posted by Ossoff attacking his opponent as a “crook” went viral on social media. Perdue said he was canceling the debate to instead appear with President Trump at a Georgia rally.

Ossoff had said Perdue was ""fending off multiple federal investigations for insider trading” after allegations arose that the lawmaker benefited from stock trades he made after a closed-door briefing on the threats of coronavirus in January.

""Perhaps Sen. Perdue would have been able to respond properly to the COVID-19 pandemic if you hadn't been fending off multiple federal investigations for insider trading,"" Ossoff said, adding: ""It's not just that you're a crook, Senator, it's that you're attacking the health of the people that you represent.""

Perdue had shot back that Ossoff worked as ""the mouthpiece of terrorism and Communist China,” displaying documents showing that Ossoff’s media firm accepted money from a Hong Kong media company whose CEO expressed opposition to pro-democracy protests.

Perdue avoided mentioning Trump in his campaign ads, instead portraying his opponent as a radical liberal on issues such as health care and police funding. Running on his record as a turnaround wizard for struggling corporations, Perdue has said he was inspired to run for office by the country's national debt crisis and national security crisis.

Ossoff, as a Southern Democrat, has in the past avoided getting caught up in national Democratic politics and ran a soundly local race. He has openly said he does not support the Green New Deal and when asked if he supported adding justices to the Supreme Court amid Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation, he responded: “I don’t support adding justices just because you don’t like the judicial philosophy of recently confirmed justices.”

Though he avoided mentioning Trump during his 2017 run for the House, this year Ossoff sought to tie his competitor to President Trump’s handling of coronavirus, noting that Perdue had characterized the virus as no worse than the flu.

Ossoff got in one last dig at his opponent on Tuesday, calling Perdue “the swamp” on Twitter, quoting a video of former President Barack Obama stumping for Democrats in his state.

Obama campaigned in Georgia against the two Republican incumbents on Monday in the run-up to Election Day.

“Your two senators publicly were telling you that the virus would be no big deal, but behind closed doors they were making a bunch of moves in the stock market,” Obama had said.

Closing this week's show, Maher began by celebrating the recent ""Instagram official"" engagement of Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani, calling it a ""symbol of reconciliation between Red and Blue America.""

Maher cited the tabloids last month that reported that the star couple was on the rocks because their ""opposing political views have become a big problem.""

""Just the fact that they're together is almost Shakespearean, 'Rodeo and Juliet,' but they make it work because they see each other as more than just who they voted for,"" Maher said. ""And they say, 'Yes, we're different but that's also more fun and we're going to make that work for us.' They see the world differently and they love each other. What a concept! I'd like to try it in America because that's how I feel about my country!""

MAHER URGES TRUMP VOTERS, LIBERALS TO MAKE PEACE AFTER ELECTION: 'LET'S SKIP THE CIVIL WAR'

He explained, ""I don't want to live in a country without the red states. I like traveling there. When people talk to you in Oklahoma, they're not scanning the room to see if there's someone more important. ... Also, they laugh like nobody's watching. They don't have a non-dairy, gluten-free, hypoallergenic stick up their ass. Even the pro-lifers will laugh at a good dead baby joke. Look, I'm pro-choice. But I also get it that fetus is irrefutably becoming a human life so can I see why some people think you are the one who's actually deplorable? Yes, I can. So let's all stop doing that. Let's all stop seeing each other as deplorable.""

The HBO star then quoted Joe Biden, who earlier this week said, ""We have to stop treating our opponents as enemies"" and asked his audience if they thought Blake Shelton ""looks like a racist.""

""I don't [think so] --- and I don't think Gwen Stefani would marry one,"" Maher answered. ""One out of ten Trump voters voted for Obama. I doubt that Blake Shelton was one of them, but that's OK! We don't all see the world the same way! Get over it! During the campaign, there was a lot of talk about who can unite us. No president can unite us! We have to unite ourselves!""

Maher warned that if the country doesn't come together, ""We'll turn into the Balkans,"" pointing to the once-diverse city of Sarajevo in the former Yugoslavia, where in 1984, ""Serbs, Croats and Muslims lived together as friendly neighbors.""

Then, just eight years later, Maher said, ""People were getting shot by snipers when they went out for milk.""

""Don't tell me it can't happen here. ... It not only can happen here, it kind of is happening here,"" Maher continued. ""People were afraid in this election to put lawn signs for the candidate of their choice if it was in a neighborhood where that was a decidedly minority opinion. That's like gang neighborhoods where you dare not get caught wearing the wrong color.""

The ""Real Time"" host concluded his monologue by circling back to Shelton and Stefani's engagement.

""Now more than ever, we need an example of cross-cultural love to send a message to our broken nation that love can lift us up where we belong, like a majestic eagle soaring above the fray and sh---ing all over the haters below!"" Maher exclaimed. ""And that is why for the sake of our nation, Gwen, Blake, you have to make this work! No seriously, it would be psychologically devastating if you, our one symbol of America's two halves coming together, s--- the bed on this. So don't!

Fox News' Jacqui Heinrich has learned that the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 230,000 Americans, will be the team's immediate focus.

Ted Kaufman, who served on Biden's staff for 22 years and was appointed to fill his vacated Senate seat when he was elected vice president in 2008, is leading the transition team.

TRUMP HAS NO PLANS TO IMMEDIATELY CONCEDE ELECTION AS BIDEN LEADS IN BATTLEGROUNDS

Kaufman started preparing for the job in April, shortly after Biden locked up the Democratic nomination.

“All governments, especially in the post 9/11 era, are at their most vulnerable during a transfer of power. I was keenly aware of this when I was part of the team in charge of the Obama-Biden transition in 2008,"" Kaufman wrote in the Delaware News Journal in 2015.

""I realized there was not nearly enough time between an Election Day in November and an inauguration day in January to adequately prepare for a new presidency.""

BIDEN SAYS HE HAS 'NO DOUBT' HE WILL DEFEAT TRUMP AFTER VOTE COUNT IS FINISHED

Former staffers for two of Biden's primary opponents, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, were laying the groundwork for a potential Biden administration.

The team is also staffed with top aides from the Obama administration, such as former Deputy National Security Adviser Avril Haines and former director of the White House National Economic Council Jeffrey Zients.

The advisory board includes at least two Republicans, Cindy McCain and former Veteran Affairs Secretary Bob McDonald.

While the team's top priority is countering the coronavirus pandemic, stimulating the economy with another relief package was also top of mind.

But Kaufman already tempered expectations about grandiose spending plans.

“When we get in, the pantry is going to be bare,” Kaufman told the Wall Street Journal in August. “When you see what Trump’s done to the deficit ... forget about Covid-19, all the deficits that he built with the incredible tax cuts. So we’re going to be limited.”

Biden's transition team also will be watching the remaining Senate elections closely, as 1,200 of a president's 4,000 appointees have to be approved by the upper chamber of Congress. If Democrats get control of the Senate, potential Biden appointees could have much more leeway during hearings.

Those electors are appointed based on voting tallies in the respective states. Hence, the counting of ballots determines who will occupy the White House for the next four years, not the liberal media.

The liberal media may declare a winner in the 2020 presidential election but such pronouncements are as irrelevant as the mainstream media itself. Given how so many of them predicted a “blue wave” landslide for former Vice President Joe Biden, no reasonable person should trust them now.

The presidency is chosen by electors from all 50 states, not liberal news organizations riven with bias or pollsters with deeply flawed calculations. Those electors are appointed based on voting tallies in the respective states. Hence, the counting of ballots determines who will occupy the White House for the next four years, not the media.

Herein rests a legal quagmire: should every vote be counted or only those votes lawfully cast? Democrats demand the former, while Republicans plead the latter. It seems inevitable that the courts —and perhaps even the U.S. Supreme Court— will have to sort it out. This is as it should be in a constitutional republic dependent on the rule of law. We resolve our differences in court, not on the streets (or in newsrooms).

NEWT GINGRICH: ELECTION CORRUPTION BY TRUMP OPPONENTS WIDESPREAD — IT’S TIME FOR US TO GET MAD

November 3, multiple lawsuits have been filed by Republican parties and the Trump campaign in states where the voting is close. This was preceded by a flurry of lawsuits filed by Democrats before the election seeking an advantage in how the votes would be counted. At present, there is litigation in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona. These cases fall into two broad categories.

The first involves the close monitoring of vote counting. In Michigan, for example, the Trump campaign is requesting that poll observers be permitted “meaningful access” to the counting process. Since the law requires this, the argument is sound. Yet, in defiance of the law, monitors have been sequestered anywhere from 20 feet to 30 feet away (in some instances, even more) from those individuals who are counting the ballots.

With such a restriction, they may as well be standing a mile away. From a distance it is not possible to witness what is on the ballot, how a vote was marked or tabulated, whether it is properly signed, or if it has a valid postmark. This is not “meaningful access, it is meaningless. A poll watcher must be able to actually watch how a ballot is being handled and computed in order to guard against suppression or chicanery.

State rules vary, but most allow for challenges if there is some indication of a voting irregularity. This cannot be accomplished from a distance where visibility is diminished. It is both wrong and illegal. The law demands transparency and the Trump campaign has every right to sue states that refuse to comply with the law.

If Americans are to have confidence in the honesty of our voting systems, they must be open to scrutiny. If we are to trust the outcome of an election, there must be a vigorous check on the process to ensure its integrity. Votes not lawfully cast should not be counted. Votes cast lawfully must be counted correctly. The only way to prevent ballot interference is to watch the process unfold.

The second legal challenge involves the exclusion of late ballots. In Pennsylvania, Republicans sued to enforce the law passed by the state legislature. That law is clear: all ballots must be received by the election boards by 8 pm on the day of the election, November 3rd. Ballots received after that time and day are not to be counted. (Georgia has a nearly identical law.)

In advance of the election and contrary to the plain language of the law, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court (elected Democrats) decided all on their own that ballots received days later could be counted, as long as there was a postmark on or before Election Day. By judicial fiat they ruled that a missing or indecipherable postmarked envelope is presumptively timely, which is absurd. A signature that does not match is automatically accepted. This is a recipe for voter fraud.

What these judges did is anathema to the constitution and a violation of the separation of powers. Without authority, the justices on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court tore up the law passed by the legislature and created a new law that conforms to their own political desires and, arguably, supports Joe Biden. It was a decision that reeks of partisanship. The legislature had considered and rejected the idea of allowing late ballots to be counted.

NEVADA: MORE THAN 120,000 MAIL-IN, PROVISIONAL BALLOTS IN CLARK COUNTY STILL NEED TO BE COUNTED

It is well to remember that judges are not lawmakers; they are not super-legislators. It is neither their duty nor right to nullify an existing law and invent a new one out of thin air to replace it. Yet, this is precisely what these justices did. They unconstitutionally usurped the power of the Pennsylvania legislature.

What is confounding is that the U.S. Supreme Court could have put a stop to this lawless action before the election took place. Republicans filed a petition to challenge the extra-legal ruling, not once but twice.

Thanks to Chief Justice John Roberts, who sided with the liberal justices, the high court refused to issue a “stay” and later declined to take up the case on the merits. This left the wrongful Pennsylvania decision in place.

Had Roberts and the Supreme Court done their job, the rules over which ballots can and cannot be counted in Pennsylvania (and Georgia) would have been clearly delineated in advance of the presidential election, avoiding the inexorable post-contest litigation and the acrimony that follows.

At the behest of Justice Samuel Alito, the high court urged Pennsylvania to segregate the tardy ballots. Are state election officials doing that? They say they are, but there’s no way to be sure. It is altogether possible (indeed, likely) that ballots have been co-mingled, making it exceedingly difficult after the fact to separate unlawful ballots from lawful ones.

Importantly, the case is still pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. On Wednesday, the Trump campaign filed a motion to intervene with the goal of resurrecting the dispute before the high court.

Will the Supremes act expeditiously to rectify their own failure? Don’t count on it.

Roberts has a long and distinguished track record of protecting the legacy of the court by dodging politically incendiary cases.

A presidential election is radioactive to Roberts. He seems to care less about the integrity of the democratic process, and more about burnishing his reputational leadership as Chief Justice.

Roberts appears to hope that it will all somehow go away. Like Cinderella, wishing is believing.

Democrats are now asking the Supreme Court to continue its stall. They know that, with the new addition of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a majority on the court would summarily strike down the Pennsylvania decision. It’s an easy call —a no-brainer. But at this point, it remains to be seen whether that same majority will now override the wishes of Roberts by voting to grant an expedited review of the case.

There are other lawsuits that have been filed by the GOP as well. Some deal with allegations of ballot tampering, ballot “harvesting,” the “curing” of ballots with discrepancies, cheating, and voter fraud. Some of these lawsuits are viable and raise legitimate concerns, while others do not.

In its rush to anoint Biden, the liberal-dominated media is already denouncing Trump for exercising his legal right to file lawsuits and contest the results. Those journalists seem to have forgotten how Al Gore did much the same 20 years ago when it took a month to resolve the endless litigation that culminated in a ruling by the Supreme Court that effectively gave the presidency to George W. Bush. They’ve never gotten over that one.

But hypocrisy and bias are endemic in the cesspool of mainstream media malfeasance these days. Increasingly, pundits, pollsters, and the liberal media have proven that they are unreliable purveyors of news and information. Frankly, they could screw-up a free lunch. Their adamant prophesy of a Biden tsunami on Election Day made a mockery of themselves and their profession.

In the end, it is the electors who chose the man who will occupy the Oval Office. Whether and to what extent the courts intervene to ensure that the process is fair and trustworthy remains an open question.

Ironically, the same liberal media that spent four years demonizing Donald Trump as an illegitimate president who stole an election may now be saddled with the identical sobriquet that haunts their chosen candidate, Joe Biden.

Stimulus fight reboots after Election Day,[],"WASHINGTON—Republican and Democratic lawmakers braced for a volatile lame-duck session, with another clash brewing over coronavirus aid and the outcome of the race for the White House, as well as some key Senate and House contests, still up in the air.

Each party logged victories in this week’s results, leaving neither side ready to make dramatic concessions in the long-running deliberations over another coronavirus relief bill. Democrats pointed to the likely path for their presidential nominee, Joe Biden, winning the White House, while Republicans said their unexpected gains in the House and victories in many contested Senate seats should compel new compromises from Democrats.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) is expected by lawmakers and aides to assume a larger role in negotiations that he had largely ceded to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Mr. Mnuchin failed to strike an agreement with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) during weeks of talks leading up to the election, and White House negotiators were often out of sync with Senate Republicans.

Mr. McConnell moved swiftly to plant markers this week, urging lawmakers to reach an agreement around a new Covid-19 relief deal before the end of the year. He pointed to data released Friday showing that the jobless rate had declined to 6.9% to highlight the logic behind the Senate Republicans’ roughly $650 billion proposal, far smaller than the $2 trillion Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin had been discussing.

WEALTHY FOCUS ON ESTATE PLANNING WITH TAX CHANGES POSSIBLE

“Our economy is really moving to get back on its feet. That I think clearly ought to affect what size of any rescue package we additionally do,” Mr. McConnell said Friday in Kentucky. “I do think we need another one, but I think it reinforces the argument that I’ve been making the last few months that something smaller rather than throwing another $3 trillion at this issue is more appropriate.”

House Democrats had initially passed a $3.5 trillion aid bill in May, before passing a scaled-back $2.2 trillion version last month to show their willingness to compromise on a smaller package as part of the negotiations with the White House. Republicans have argued the economy was on track to a self-sustaining recovery, Democrats have said more funding was needed to fully address the and contain the impact of the pandemic.

White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow indicated that the administration was talking with Mr. McConnell about a package similar to what the Senate GOP has proposed.

“We are not interested in, you know, $2 or $3 trillion,” Mr. Kudlow said. “We think we’re in a very strong position. The president and his policies have long coattails in this election.”

Mrs. Pelosi made clear on Friday that she wasn’t ready to abandon many of the priorities she had been holding out for in her negotiations with Mr. Mnuchin.

“That isn’t anything we should be looking at. It wasn’t the right thing to do before,” she said of the Senate GOP bill, which Democrats had blocked.

The GOP legislation includes another round of forgivable loans to small businesses under the Paycheck Protection Program, offers $300 in weekly federal jobless benefits, establishes legal protections for businesses and health providers, adds an infusion of funding for testing and vaccines and provides new money for schools and child care.

But it doesn’t include a second round of direct checks for Americans or funding for state and local governments, among other provisions Democrats have sought. Democrats also were seeking $600 in weekly jobless aid.

Lawmakers return to Washington after the election for a “lame duck” session that runs until the new Congress is sworn in in early January. Democrats are currently expected to maintain a narrow majority in the House, while control of the Senate is expected to be decided by two runoff races in Georgia in January.

There are incentives for both parties to try to cut an agreement while Mr. Trump is still in office, whether or not he wins a second term. Republicans will have less leverage if Mr. Biden takes power next year, while Democrats see advantages in passing a bill now as well to avoid a logjam if Mr. Biden is elected. If left unaddressed, the debate over a stimulus bill could quickly balloon next year if it gets ensnared with fights over spending bills or the debt limit, which is currently suspended through July 2021, draining Mr. Biden’s political capital early on.

But lame-duck sessions are notorious for accomplishing little and lawmakers worried this year’s dynamics could be particularly thorny.

“It’s going to be a challenge because we’re negotiating with McConnell and we don’t have a president who’s incentivized electorally to do anything,” Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.) said Friday of a Covid-19 relief bill. “We have to figure out now what’s the best we can get.”

Mrs. Pelosi faces frustration from some Democrats who had urged her to reach an agreement with White House officials before the election, when Mr. Trump was more motivated to cut a deal he believed could help boost his re-election prospects. It wasn’t clear, however, how such an agreement could have passed the GOP-controlled Senate, which Mr. McConnell had signaled would oppose a package with a nearly $2 trillion price tag.

Some Democrats said they were concerned about whether Mr. Trump would be willing to back a deal, considering he may be still challenging election results.

“My worry is that Donald Trump is going to be in a personal and political meltdown after he realizes he’s lost the election,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) said. “I worry that Trump will be the obstacle in the lame duck even if McConnell wants to do something.”

Some lawmakers from both parties believe a large package is out of reach.

Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of Senate GOP leadership, said Democrats’ losses in the House signaled that Mrs. Pelosi would have to make new concessions.

“The vast majority of her members also think she has to give some ground here, that the liberal agenda was rejected by voters,” he told reporters Friday.

“We should be looking at a very practical path forward. And it’s not going to be the $2 trillion or more. It’s not going to be there at all,” Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a centrist Democrat, said this week.

Other Democrats urged Mrs. Pelosi to stand firm.

“Providing a stimulus package is so urgently needed, but I don’t believe that we should shortcut the American people,” said Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.), who lost her father and cousin to complications from the coronavirus. “I have been supportive of the fact that the hill she wants to die on is providing aid to local municipalities and our states.”

Rahm Emanuel says Biden administration should help laid off retail workers 'become a computer coder',"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']","Former Chicago Mayor and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel insisted on Friday that a Biden administration will help offer a promising future for laid-off retail workers.

According to the Fox News Decision Desk, Joe Biden currently has 264 electoral votes, just six votes short of the magic number needed to win the White House.

During a panel discussion on ABC, George Stephanopoulos asked the former Obama official what Joe Biden needs to do as president to combat the coronavirus and its effect on the economy.

Emmanuel initially responded by acknowledging that the ""blunt instrument of a lockdown"" put in place earlier in the year was a ""mistake"" and said that the Biden administration needs to support testing and contact tracing in ""targeted areas"" to protect people of color and the elderly.

The ABC political analyst then pivoted to what should be Biden's economic plan.

""The first part of the stimulus is creating a floor so the economy doesn't sink any more. You can't get an economy growing if states and companies are laying people off,"" Emmanuel said. ""The second piece -- one of the things we've got to do to rebuild, mainly on infrastructure and there's going to be people like at JCPenney and other retail -- those jobs aren't coming back.

""Give them the tools [and say] 'Six months, you're going to become a computer coder. We'll pay for it.' And you'll get millions of people to sign up for that. They're not going back to parts of the retail economy and we need to give them a lifeline to what's the next chapter.""

AOC wants anti-Trump Lincoln Project to give money to those who 'actually' made a difference,['Michael Ruiz'],"After the Democratic Party failed to meet its electoral expectations in House races around the country on Election Day, one New York Democrat urged a conservative political group to donate money to progressive organizations.

In a string of tweets Friday night, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez argued that “the right thing” for the anti-Trump Lincoln Project would be to donate “a lot” of its money to “people who actually made a big difference.”

And if the group has already spent its fundraising proceeds, she said it should just raise more to give away.

AOC PUSHES BACK ON BLAMING PROGRESSIVES FOR DEMOCRATIC HOUSE LOSSES

“There’s potential incentive bc @ProjectLincoln is def in scam territory w these results,” she tweeted. “It’s a pretty bad rep even tho GOP has a thing for failing up. Come clean, say ‘listen, we thought it’d work, it didn’t, & in good faith we’re gonna raise X mil for these ppl who deserve it.’”

She also questioned how many Republican voters the group’s ads, which included billboards in heavily Democratic New York City, had actually persuaded.

Members of the Lincoln Project have said that they were hoping to swing a share of GOP voters and conservative independents toward Biden. They also spent millions in congressional races, attacking Republican incumbents who wound up winning reelection, like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

AOC RIPS MSNBC'S CLAIRE MCCASKILL: 'WHY DO WE LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO LOST ELECTIONS?'

“Our efforts are aimed at persuading enough disaffected conservatives, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents in swing states and districts to help ensure a victory in the Electoral College and majorities that don’t enable and abet Trump’s violations of the Constitution; even if that means Democrat control of the Senate and expansion of the Democratic majority in the House,” members of the group wrote in a New York Times op-ed announcing its mission.

Ocasio-Cortez separately blamed her outgoing House colleagues’ “execution on digital,” for their losses.

Joe Scarborough calls election 'absolute repudiation' of Dem 'brand' despite likely Biden win,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News.

According to the Fox News Decision Desk, Biden currently has 264 electoral votes, just six votes short of the magic number needed to win the White House. However, Democrats were far less successful down the ballot. with the party so far failing to take control of the Senate, losing several seats in the House, and even losing two state legislatures.

""I've got to put a sidebar in here because after the dust settles, if Joe Biden ends up winning the presidency, then I think a lot of people are going to turn to what happened to the Democratic Party,"" the ""Morning Joe"" co-host began. ""There is no way to put this other than to say ... Joe Biden winning looks like a one-off. This election for the most part was an absolute repudiation of the Democratic Party as a brand. Their brand doesn’t work across most of America. It just doesn’t.""

Scarborough went on, ""They got routed in Senate races they should have won. And I mean, and if you don’t believe me, just look back at all the predictions. Are Democrats going to win nine, 10, 11 Senate seats? The House results are perhaps even more shocking. Nobody thought that this was going to be close. The weekend before the election, Republican pollsters were talking about hemorrhaging support in suburbs and couldn’t believe the numbers. They said, 'We’re going to get destroyed.' Well, it ended up [that] they couldn’t believe the numbers for a good reason. The numbers were wrong!""

Head of agency that oversees US nuclear arsenal unexpectedly resigns,['Brie Stimson'],"The head of the National Nuclear Security Administration unexpectedly resigned Friday, the agency confirmed.

Lisa E. Gordon-Hagerty was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in February 2018, and was the first woman to hold the position at the agency that oversees the nation's nuclear arsenal.

Dr. William Bookless, who served as NNSA principal deputy administrator, will take over as acting NNSA administrator, “ensuring the continuity of NNSA’s vital mission to sustain the safety, security and effectiveness of our nuclear deterrent and strengthen our national security,” the agency said in a release.

Gordon-Hagerty “oversaw the modernization of NNSA’s infrastructure and the strengthening of its world-class workforce,” the release said. “She also made significant strides in improving NNSA governance and management and demonstrated a sincere dedication to the 50,000 men and women serving in the national security workforce.”

PENTAGON PUSHES BACK AGAINST NBC'S REPORT THAT ESPER 'PREPARED A RESIGNATION LETTER'

The agency didn’t give a reason for Gordon-Hagerty’s resignation but it came after months of tensions between her office and Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette, according to Defense News.

TRUMP SAYS THE US IS NEGOTIATING A NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION TREATY WITH RUSSIA

The NNSA is a semi-autonomous agency within the U.S. Department of Energy responsible for enhancing national security through the military application of nuclear science, according to NNSA’s website.

In September, a bill called the Department of Energy Organization and Management Improvement Act was passed by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which put the NNSA more fully under the DOE’s control, Defense News reported.

The move was reportedly seen as an effort by Brouillette to get rid of the NNSA.

Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, accused Brouillette of forcing Gordon-Hagerty to resign.

“A short while ago, I spoke with Administrator Gordon-Hagerty, who is an exemplary public servant and remarkable leader of the National Nuclear Security Administration,” Inhofe said in a statement released by his office Friday. “That the Secretary of Energy effectively demanded her resignation during this time of uncertainty demonstrates he doesn’t know what he’s doing in national security matters and shows a complete lack of respect for the semi-autonomous nature of NNSA.”

Gordon-Hagerty's departure coincided with two other Trump administration changes, NPR reported. Bonnie Glick, deputy administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, was replaced by the acting administrator John Barsa; and Neil Chatterjee, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, was moved to a different role inside FERC, according to NPR."
Pennsylvania GOP lawmaker claims Democratic officials worked to 'tip the scales' to Biden,['Charles Creitz'],"Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf and Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar have done everything they can in the way of ""changing the rules"" to help Joe Biden, state Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman claimed Friday

Corman, a Republican, charged on ""America's Newsroom"" that the executive branch's actions caused the integrity of the election to be compromised.

""The integrity of this election is called into question. I don’t have evidence of any misdoing,"" Corman told host Trace Gallgher, ""but all their actions are leading to us wondering why they didn’t want people watching this process and didn’t allow poll watchers in the pre-voting, or getting close enough to see what was going on.""

Hours before the election, Boockvar issued updated guidance to counties about how they should collect and separate ballots arriving after 8 p.m. ET on Election Day.

In addition, Boockvar's office issued orders that largely eliminated the ballot signature verification requirement. Pennsylvania officials also ordered that ballots arriving before Friday evening should be accepted but segregated if they are either postmarked by Election Day or lack a postmark.

PENNSYLVANIA LAWMAKER COMPARES STATE'S ELECTION CHAOS TO AFGHANISTAN

Boockvar has pushed back on calls by Corman, Senate President-Pro-Tempore Joe Scarnati, R-Jefferson, and Sen. Doug Mastriano, R-Franklin, to resign amid the electoral chaos playing out in Philadelphia and around the state, claiming Republicans ""don't like"" the idea of counting late ballots because ""they don't like anything that allows more eligible voters to be enfranchised.""

Additionally, State Rep. Russ Diamond, R-Lebanon, has called for a full ""audit"" of the statewide presidential vote, echoing demnds in a letter from House Speaker Bryan Cutler, R-Lancaster, to Wolf.

In that letter, Cutler also accused the Democratic-majority State Supreme Court of failing to allow the legislature to ""intervene"" before essentially changing the state's election laws on its own.

""[D]ue directly to these issues I am requesting that a full audit be conducted of the 2020 general election prior to the certification of any results,"" Cutler wrote.

Corman, R-Centre, told Fox News Friday that while the vote tally statewide may be completed soon, each of the 67 counties has to certify their vote. Time must then be allowed for legal challenges -- some of which have already been launched in Philadelphia County by Trump attorney Rudolph Giuliani.

""If there are requests for a recount they will have to go through that process,"" he said. ""This is the unfortunate part about what Secretary Boockvar has done -- and by extension Governor Tom Wolf -- by changing a lot of the rules over how this is done, and doing everything they could to tip the scales in favor of Joe Biden.""

Corman singled out Philadelphia County once again as a place where there is potential for ""misdoing"".

""If [Wolf] would have allowed everyone to watch it the way we normally are we would have more faith,"" he added.

Corman concluded by stating Democrats have done a ""great disservice,"" claiming that such ""shenanigans"" will cause any Biden victory to be deemed illegitimate by half the electorate."

Tucker Carlson: A Biden victory would usher in the Age of Oligarchy,"['Tucker Carlson', 'Tucker Carlson Currently Serves As The Host Of Fox News Channel S', 'Fnc']","Editor's Note: This article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the Nov. 6, 2020 edition of ""Tucker Carlson Tonight""

Who exactly is Joe Biden, the man who may be our president come Jan. 20? The truth is, as of right now, we don't really know.

We have no clue what Joe Biden actually thinks, or even if he's capable of thinking. He hasn't told us and no one's made him tell us for a full year. In fact, it's becoming clear there is no Joe Biden. The man you may remember from the 1980s is gone.

What remains is a projection of sorts, a hologram designed to mimic the behavior of a non-threatening political candidate: ""Relax, Joe Biden's here. He smiles a lot. Everything's fine."" That's the message from the vapor candidate.

So who's running the projector here? Well, the first thing you should know is that the people behind Joe Biden aren't liberals. We've often incorrectly called them that. A liberal believes in the right of all Americans to speak freely, to make a living, to worship their God, to defend their own families, and to do all of that regardless of what political party they belong to or what race they happen to be born into or how far from midtown Manhattan they currently live.

A liberal believes in universal principles, fairly applied. And the funny thing is, all of that describes most of the 70 million people who just voted for Donald Trump this week. Most of them don't want to hurt or control anyone. They have no interest in silencing the opposition on Facebook or anywhere else. They just want to live their lives in the country they were born in, and it doesn't seem like a lot to ask. So by any traditional definition, they are liberal.

However, our language has become so politicized and so distorted that you would never know it. What you do know for certain is that the people behind Joe Biden are not like that at all. They don't believe in dissent. ""You think one thing? I think another. That's OK."" No, that's not them at all. They demand obedience to diversity, which is to say, legitimate differences between people is the last thing they want. These people seek absolute sameness, total uniformity. You're happy with your corner coffee shop? They want to make you drink Starbucks every day from now until forever, no matter how it tastes. That's the future.

TUCKER CARLSON: MEDIA MISJUDGED TRUMP SUPPORT AMONG NON-WHITE VOTERS

Now, if these seem like corporate values to you, then you're catching on to what's happening. The Joe Biden for President campaign is a purely corporate enterprise. It's the first one in American history to come this close to the presidency. If a multinational corporation decided to create a presidential candidate, he would be a former credit card shill from Wilmington, Del., and that's exactly what they got. What's good for Google is good for the Biden campaign and vice versa. We have never seen a more soulless project. They literally picked Kamala Harris as Biden's running mate, someone who can't even pronounce her own name. Not that it matters, because it's purely an advertising gimmick.

We watched all of this come together in real time. We stood slack-jawed in total disbelief as a man with no discernible constituency of any kind rose to the very top of our political system, as if by magic. It's possible in the end that Joe Biden himself never convinced a single voter of anything over the entire duration of the presidential campaign, but he didn't have to. Joe Biden won the Democratic nomination because he wasn't Bernie Sanders. He came to where he is today because he isn't Donald Trump. It's the shortest political story ever written.

Now, whatever you may think of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, they did it the traditional way. Each one of them had the support of actual voters. Living, breathing people loved them, believed in them, vested their hope in them, and, by the way, agreed with their ideas, which they articulated clearly. But corporate America hated them both. They couldn't be controlled, particularly Donald Trump, whose complete unwillingness to submit made him the greatest possible threat. That's why they hate Donald Trump, because he won't obey.

It's insulting to say that Joseph R. Biden won this election, if that is what comes to pass. The tech companies will have won. The big banks will have won. The government of China, the media establishment, the permanent bureaucracy, the billionaire class -- they will have won, and not in the way that democracy promises. If a single person equaled a single vote, a coalition like that could never win anything. There aren't enough of them.

But as a group, they have something that Donald Trump's voters sadly do not have, and that is power. They have lots of power and they plan to wield that power, whether you like it or not. It's all starting to look a lot like oligarchy at this point. The people who believe they should have been in charge all along now may actually be in charge.

So what does that mean for the rest of us? Will corporate America declare victory and back off? Can we speak freely again? Will they take the boot from our necks? Can we have America back now that the Great Orange Emergency has passed? Well, the mandatory lying orders finally be lifted?

Those are the questions we'll be paying attention to, since we plan to stay in this country. And one other thing while we're at it, who's excited to greet our new corporate overlords? Who plans to collaborate, particularly of those on the right side, the Republican side, the side that said it was defending you? Who's happy about all of this? That seems worth keeping track of, just so we know who we're dealing with here."

Documentary: Minnesota man murdered by siblings felt threatened before grisly end,['Stephanie Nolasco'],"EXCLUSIVE: Minnesota man Edwin Hawes met a grisly end at the hands of his brother and sister.

The horrific case is being explored in Season 2 of Oxygen’s true-crime docu-series “Killer Siblings,” which spotlights some of the most terrifying slayings committed by family members. Psychologists, detectives, investigators and those who knew both the victims and killers speak out.

District attorney Paul Young told Fox News there’s no question Hawes’ murder will leave audiences stunned.

“When horrible things happen, it makes you want to communicate that information to others, so people can get an accurate understanding of what happened in the criminal justice system from the initial investigation to the trial,” Young said of why he shared his account for the show. “I think people benefit from getting accurate, first-hand information about how we handle some of the worst things to ever happen in our cities and communities.”

CALIFORNIA MURDER-FOR-HIRE PLOT LED BY RUTHLESS DEBT COLLECTOR EXPLORED IN NEW DOC: 'HE WAS PRETTY EVIL'

In late 2008, police found a burned body at a farm. When Hawes’ sister Elizabeth Hawes was asked about the large illegal fire, the then-43-year-old replied, “That’s not my brother,” the Star Tribune reported. Court documents also showed that at one point, she also said. “Maybe [Edwin] was in an accident. I hope he dies. He’s a very bad man.”

But dental records indicated it was her missing sibling.

Anoka County authorities later revealed Hawes was shot in the chest by a crossbow at his Andover home, beaten over the head with a baseball bat, run over, and then taken across the state where his charred remains were discovered at a farm owned by his brother Andrew Hawes, 36, the outlet shared.

Previously, blood was found on Hawes’ driveway, his home’s exterior and on the undercarriage of his car when he was reported missing.

“One thing that stood out to me was that it was very evident that multiple locations were crime scenes,” Young said. “We had the house where the blood splatter was, as well as articles that were attempted to be used to clean up scattered throughout. It was something that was planned and it was something that was violent.”

Young described Elizabeth’s initial statement to the police as “chilling.”

“It was a very bold statement,” he said. “You knew he’s missing. Well, maybe something happened. Maybe there was an accident. But this was personal. We have a sibling, someone you would trust. Someone who’s part of your family… But when you become desperate, you do desperate things.”

And bad blood ran deep in the Hawes family.

NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON’S SISTER SAYS SHE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE 10 YEARS AFTER MURDER: 'I WENT BIG'

A year before Hawes was killed outside his home, his mother, Demetria Hawes, said she discovered that family stocks, a retirement fund and even a burial fund, all entrusted to his care, had disappeared, the Twin Cities Pioneer Press reported.

The matriarch claimed in court that the family began to find out about the missing money in spring 2007. Hawes was granted power of attorney over his 100-year-old grandmother years earlier and her stocks were sold without her approval. Demetria said she believed the stocks amounted to $600,000, the outlet shared.

A loan had also been taken out on the grandmother’s home, and her prepaid burial fund was also gone. Demetria testified that when she checked on a retirement fund for her and her husband, she only spotted “two, three dollars in that account” where there should have been $20,000.

The outlet also noted that once the family learned that the money was gone, Hawes left the family lawn care business he was originally running with his brother Andrew.

It was also reported that Andrew threatened his brother once he was convinced that Hawes was writing company checks that had nothing to do with the lawn service. Despite the reported findings made by the siblings, it was reported that Hawes was never charged with a crime.

“The exact motive may never be known,” Young said. “Only two people could perhaps ever talk about that. But from the outside, from what the investigation showed, these acts were an exclamation mark, if you will, from misunderstanding, jealousy, and a deteriorating relationship that all came together. The brother and sister who killed Edwin determined in their minds that there was no other alternative but to commit this horrific crime.”

“… The animosity seemed to be most directed at money, how it was used, how much it should have been, and where it should be,” Young added.

Things had become so tumultuous between the siblings that Hawes was granted a restraining order against his sister a month before he died. Police would later find latex gloves with her DNA and Hawes’ blood.

“Edwin was attempting to create space and distance,” Young said. “And when somebody gets a restraining order, they feel threatened. They know they need help.”

Andrew testified that he provided the crossbow, accidentally backed the car over his brother in a panic and later dragged Hawes’ body into the fire pit and ignited it, the Star Tribune reported.

In 2010, the siblings were found guilty and received life sentences with no chance of parole.

“Andrew and Elizabeth were flawed individuals who took out whatever grudges they had, real or perceived, on their brother,” Young said. “I was not able to appreciate any remorse for what they did. Whether they had it or not, I can’t say. But what came across in court was the offering of excuses and pointing fingers.”

Young hopes the series will give audiences a clearer picture of how the justice system works, especially when it comes to a gruesome murder, like Hawes’.

“Edwin lost his life,” said Young. “His family who survived him has to go on without Edwin. There are two people in prison for committing horrific acts. Everyone’s lives are forever changed in this story.”

Manufacturers fare better than many service providers in COVID-19 economy,[],"The coronavirus has dealt a savage blow to the world economy, idling workers and bankrupting businesses around the globe.

Continue Reading Below

But months into the crisis, a clear divide between survivors and casualties is emerging. Countries, workers and industries that rely on making stuff -- from computers to furniture to toys -- are getting by, or even thriving, amid the economic maelstrom.

Meanwhile, those who provide the sort of face-to-face services that people avoid out of fear of infection -- traveling, eating out, going to the movies and some child care -- are struggling. Services that don't require physical proximity -- such as many financial services, software and telecommunications -- have been less badly hit, as have construction and farming.

This divide between manufacturing and services means the pain has fallen especially heavily on female and immigrant workers and on economies with large informal sectors or with heavy exposure to tourism, entertainment and travel.

That divide is especially alarming given this autumn's spike in infections in much of the West, suggesting workers, companies and countries reliant on services face a long, painful recovery that may only arrive when a Covid-19 vaccine comes into widespread use.

Historic divide

According to growth forecasts by the International Monetary Fund, the world's economies are diverging this year more sharply than ever before. Much of the difference seems to come down to the economic structure countries had going into the crisis, rather than their handling of the virus.

Manufacturing and export-heavy economies in Asia have performed well, while those with large tourism sectors have suffered, even where the pandemic had been brought under control.

For instance, Thailand has reported just a handful of local cases in the past three months, but relies heavily on tourism and has suffered. Taiwan, on the other hand, is a major exporter of computer components and electrical machinery.

ALUMINUM CAN SHORTAGE IN US HAS BREWERIES FEELING THE EFFECTS

Factories have largely recovered from the nationwide lockdowns some countries imposed in the spring, while trade with China -- which produces key inputs for many manufacturers -- has recovered.

But face-to-face services are still in the doldrums. For instance, in the U.K., industrial production was just 6% lower in August than in February, but services output was down 9.6%.

In September, global car production marked its biggest jump in production in a decade, as consumers avoided public transport...

...but travel and entertainment remain depressed.

That is hurting jobs...

Women's Work

US ECONOMY ADDED 638,000 JOBS IN OCTOBER AS UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS TO 6.9%

In a reversal of what happened in the wake of the global financial crisis, women have suffered larger job losses this time, in part because they are heavily represented in face-to-face services jobs. For economists, this is one of the big changes of the current recession, with men having suffered more job losses than women in each of the six downturns recorded in the U.S. since 1970.

The fall in employment in the three months through June from the same period a year earlier was larger for women in almost all of the countries surveyed by the International Labor Organization.

In the U.S., employment in leisure and hospitality recorded the largest fall in September since early this year, a sign that the new spike in infections is still hurting female employment.

Reverse Migration

Immigrants have been especially hard hit by the closure of restaurants, bars and other businesses that involve face-to-face contact. Migrants account for a larger share of employment in the accommodation and food-services industries than they do in the workforce as a whole, especially in Europe. Without those jobs, many were forced to return to their home countries.

In the Shadows

In many parts of the world, but especially the poorest countries, large shares of the workforce make their living outside of formal employment. Over two billion people work in the informal economy globally, according to the International Labor Organization, including over 80% of workers in populous countries like India, Indonesia and Nigeria.

Jobs in the informal sector are often in services, from cleaning houses to washing dishes in restaurants. Many of these jobs have fallen victim to the downturn."
Minnesota college president offers to bail out students arrested in protests,['Thomas Barrabi'],"A college president in Minnesota offered Thursday to help cover the costs of bail for any student arrested during protests related to the 2020 presidential election.

Macalester College President Suzanne Rivera said she “care[s] deeply about both the wellbeing of our students and their right to practice civil disobedience.” The school official said she wanted to “affirm” that students “have the support of Macalester in various ways.”

“Any currently enrolled student who participates in civil disobedience and needs help with bail or a fine they cannot afford can seek reimbursement by emailing me,” Rivera wrote on Twitter.

Macalester is located close to Minneapolis, one of several U.S. cities where protestors took to the streets as efforts to complete ballots in battleground states stretched beyond Election Day. More than 600 people were arrested in Minneapolis after staging an anti-Trump protest temporarily shut down Interstate 94.

Rivera offered a further explanation in an email to the Pioneer Press, telling the newspaper that her goal was to defend free speech regardless on both sides of the political aisle. To date, no student has requested financial assistance for bail.

Matthew McConaughey reveals why he's never shared details of his sexual abuse: Nothing 'constructive',['Nate Day'],"Matthew McConaughey is opening up about his past.

In his memoir published last month, the 51-year-old actor reveals he suffered sexual abuse twice in his youth, once when he was 15 and again when he was 18.

The mentions of the abuse are brief and without much detail and he also insists he ""never felt like a victim.""

Now, during an appearance on the ""Tamron Hall"" show, the Oscar winner has explained why he didn't further detail the abusive encounters.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY REVEALS HE WAS SEXUALLY ABUSED AS A TEEN IN NEW MEMOIR: REPORT

""Ultimately, there's nothing that I feel is constructive about the details,"" he said.

""I feel like those details, unless I had a really good constructive way that I saw it that could be relatable to other people, I felt like those details could have just been grabbed and reported for voyeurism,"" said the ""Dallas Buyers Club"" star, per E! News. ""They could've been the thing that every single show was going to go 'Read about the details of when Matthew was molested,' or 'Read about when he got blackmailed,' and that's the wrong headline.""

McConaughey reiterated that he never ""felt like a victim"" of sexual abuse.

""Was I victimized in those two situations? Sure. But that doesn't mean that I've carried on through my life the feeling of, 'Oh, I was victimized,' or, 'Oh, I was a victim,' or that those two unfortunate events have turned me into the man that I am or are even an excuse,"" he said.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: 'EMBRACE' RESULTS OF 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 'WHICHEVER WAY IT GOES'

The actor added that had the abusive encounters occurred when he was younger, he ""would've been more confused.""

""When they happened to me, it was very clear to me, that they were wrong, that they were not ideal, that they were not how it's supposed to be,"" McConaughey shared. ""So I think having that clarity means that it's probably why it didn't stick with me and confuse me later on or left me having a non-realistic view of the way the world is supposed to work.""

In 2012, McConaughey married model Camila Alves, with whom he shares three kids: Levi, 12, Vida, 10, and Livingston, 7.

"Facing worst COVID-19 surge, US tries to avoid lockdowns",[],"The rebound of the pandemic is driving some cities and states to bring back restrictions on daily life, but with a lighter touch than before in hopes of minimizing the economic damage caused by sweeping lockdowns.

The new targeted actions range from prohibiting indoor service at bars and restaurants in Illinois to fining the hosts of disorderly, overcrowded indoor parties in Hoboken, N.J., and new statewide mandates in Massachusetts and Maine requiring people to wear face coverings in public, regardless of physical distance from others.

""In the spring we only had blunt instruments -- close all schools, close all restaurants, close everything. We don't need to do that now,"" Rhode Island's Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo said when she issued a series of new two-week interventions this week, from limiting capacity at big box stores to asking people in an advisory to be home by 10 p.m. on weekdays and 10:30 on weekends.

Nearly every state in the U.S. is experiencing a resurgence of the virus as the nation this week logged its first day with more than 100,000 new cases. The seven-day average for new Covid-19 cases exceeded the 14-day average in 47 states Thursday -- an indication of acceleration, according to data from Johns Hopkins. An increase in hospitalizations and deaths has followed the rising numbers, and hospitals in the South and Midwest are showing signs of strain.

CHIPOTLE FACES EMPLOYEE SHORTAGES AS COVID-19 CASES SPIKE

Public-policy makers, including Ms. Raimondo, aren't necessarily precluding moving to broader closures if the spread of the virus worsens, but they say they are trying smaller, targeted measures first to avoid those harsher steps.

""If we need to take further steps and move back into Phase Three or even going back to shelter in place, I'm not going to hesitate to do that,"" Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a Democrat, recently warned residents. ""I hope that won't be necessary, but it is all in your hands.""

After surges during the spring and summer, public-health officials cautioned that the pandemic could intensify again as temperatures fall, driving people indoors at a moment when pandemic fatigue is causing many to let their guard down. Hospitalizations in recent days hit their highest point in three months.

""These alarming numbers really suggest that we need to double down and really focus on a public-health response,"" said Dr. Thomas Tsai, an assistant professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Public officials are able to take more focused steps because they know more about how the virus spreads, and hospitals are better equipped to prepare for surges and treat the disease, said Dr. Tsai. He said targeted steps to reduce interactions between people, such as curtailing dining hours or the number of people allowed at gatherings, can reduce spread. He noted, for instance, that research of mobility data from cellphones in the U.S. and Europe found a roughly 10% reduction in social mobility or movement translated to a similar decrease in the number of Covid cases.

""I think this is a moment where this large basket of smaller interventions can be effective and needs to be implemented in a lot of the hot-spot areas,"" he said.

On Friday, seven of the top 10 states with the most new cases in the past seven days were in the Midwest, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Illinois ranked No. 1.

FULL-SERVICE RESTAURANTS COULD TAKE 5 YEARS TO RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC: REPORT

The rise prompted Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and state health officials to start implementing mitigation measures on a regional basis a few weeks ago. As of this week, every region of the state is under heightened restrictions, including a ban on indoor service at bars and restaurants.

Mr. Pritzker, a Democrat, said if the state's Covid-19 case trajectory doesn't change, some areas will run out of hospital beds, nurses and doctors, and lead to statewide mitigations at a level that ""nobody -- and I mean nobody -- wants.""

He admonished county and city leaders who haven't been enforcing the reinstated restrictions.

""Far too many governments across the state are failing to enforce any mitigation measures, allowing this continued rise in positivity to balloon out of control,"" he told a news conference. ""It's time to take some responsibility.""

While governments in Europe and the U.K. have recently imposed widespread lockdown measures as coronavirus cases rise, the response in the U.S. is more patchwork. That stems from the fact that most public-health powers rest with the states under the Constitution, according to global health experts.

In El Paso, Texas, the seven-day average of Covid-19-related hospitalizations was 991 on Thursday, more than triple the previous high in late July. Emergency officials have set up a field hospital at the convention center. El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego, the county's Democratic chief executive, said mortuaries are backing up. He has imposed a two-week stay-at-home order through Nov. 11. On Friday, a state court said the order could remain in place, rejecting a request from a group of restaurant operators and the state's Republican attorney general for a temporary injunction.

""We're about to go into crisis mode,"" Mr. Samaniego said. The attorney general's office said it would appeal.

Wisconsin's leaders have been divided over how to respond to the pandemic, with the public-health orders and mandates issued by the administration of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers regularly being challenged by the Republican-controlled legislature and others.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court recently agreed to hear a lawsuit challenging the powers that Mr. Evers used when issuing a statewide mask mandate. That mandate was recently upheld by a circuit court judge.

In Iowa and Ohio, Republican governors said they are considering increased mitigations but were concerned about the consequences to the economy and residents, many of whom say they are only just recovering from the hardships caused during the first wave of the pandemic. The governors urged residents to do their part to slow the spread of the virus by wearing masks, washing their hands and adhering to social-distancing guidelines.

""This should scare you that you have this much spread in your hometown,"" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said. ""A lot of this we can't micromanage and we can't control, but the public can, people can.""

In Iowa, Gov. Kim Reynolds said that while her administration continues to weigh measures, she wants Iowans to double down on voluntary actions like wearing face masks and social distancing. She was planning to roll out a public-awareness campaign aimed at fostering a sense of civic mindedness.

""I've heard from business owners who are finally starting to make a comeback and have indicated they can't afford another shutdown, families who for the first time received assistance from the state or their local communities when they couldn't make ends meet because they lost their jobs, parents who are grateful to finally have their children back in school,"" she said. ""These stories and those of countless others are why it is so important that every Iowan does their part to stop the spread of Covid-19."""

Jason Day in contention in Houston Open on eve of Masters,[],"Jason Day was back in contention on the eve of the Masters after two eventful days alongside Phil Mickelson.

Winless in 2 1/2 years and fighting lingering back and neck problems, Day shot a 2-under 68 on Friday in the Houston Open to pull within two strokes of second-round leader Sam Burns at difficult Memorial Park.

The Australian watched the 50-year-old Michelson hit into the water twice en route to an 8 on the par-3 ninth, then hole out from 193 yards for eagle on the par-4 18th. Lefty missed the cut, following an opening 76 with a 73.

“He kind of left himself in some pretty tough positions and you’re just struggling the whole day,” Day said. “It’s one of those courses where you’ve just got to be patient and try to get your birdies when you can.”

Day had three birdies and a bogey.

“It’s one of those courses where you can walk off kind of shaking your head even though you play some good golf,” Day said. “I was chatting to Phil about that on the second hole today because he went out there and hit a nice 9-iron, pulled up short, rolled away off the green and you’ve got a 60-footer putting back up that hill. It’s one of those golf courses where it can be a little bit frustrating at times, so just got to kind of be smart about it.”

Day was in contention three weeks ago in Las Vegas in the CJ Cup when the neck problem forced him to withdraw early in the final round. The 12-time PGA Tour winner returned the next week at Sherwood to tie for 60th, and took last week off.

“It’s been very inconsistent, obviously, because I’m trying to change my swing a little bit just to try and help the back out,” Day said. “I guess I’m stuck in between patterns right now, what I want to feel, my body just won’t handle it and sometimes it just compensates elsewhere. That’s why it happened to my neck at CJ.”

Burns birdied all three par-5 holes in a bogey-free 65 to reach 7 under.“

It takes a lot of discipline around here,” Burns said. “You get out of position, you just try to get it back to where you can get it up-and-down or get it in a section of the green where you can lag putt it. Fortunately, early we got some good looks and I was able to convert, so solid.”

Winless on the PGA Tour, the 24-year-old Burns also took a two-shot lead into the weekend in the season-opening Safeway Championship in September. He ended up tying for seventh that week at Silverado.

“I think slowing down a little bit, really talking through the shot with Travis (caddie Perkins) and making sure we have a clear picture of what we’re trying to do,” Burns said. “I think that was really helpful to learn that.”

Carlos Ortiz of Mexico had a 68 to match Day at 5 under.

First-round leader Brandt Snedeker followed his opening 65 with a 71 to drop into a tie for fourth at 4 under with Dawie van der Walt (66), Corey Conners (67), Aaron Wise (66) and Patton Kizzire (67).

“Didn’t drive it as good today as I did yesterday and that’s going to put you behind the 8-ball here,” Snedeker said.

Top-ranked Dustin Johnson followed an opening 72 with a 66 to get to 2 under in his return after a positive coronavirus test knocked him out of the CJ Cup and Zozo Championship.

“It was very solid today,” Johnson said. “ I felt like I played pretty well yesterday, just a little rusty. ... I swung it pretty well, just hit a couple bad iron shots. But I think that was more just from not trusting what I was doing, just from not being out there. But today did a lot better, hit a lot of really nice iron shots and felt like I managed my game very well, drove it well, hit a lot of quality shots.”

The tournament — at public Memorial Park for the first time since 1963 — is the first domestic PGA Tour event to have fans since March. Tickets are capped at 2,000 a day.

While the fate of the presidential election still hangs in the balance, Trump is projected to win Florida's 29 electoral votes thanks in large part to Cuban American voters in the traditionally Democratic stronghold Miami-Dade County, which has a heavily Hispanic population.

""Maybe this information will help put an end to the incessant virtue-signaling and reliance on identity politics the Democrats love so much."" — Tomi Lahren, Fox Nation

Cuban-American voters favored the president’s reelection, even though 59% of Hispanic voters, in general, supported Biden, according to polling from the Fox News Voter Analysis, compared to Trump’s 40%.

""Pretty incredible considering the fact the Democrats and much of the mainstream media have spent the last 5 plus years telling us he’s a racist, particularly against Latinos,"" Lahren observed.

Pundits have spent the week pontificating about what Trump did right and Biden did wrong to win over non-White voters in the Sunshine State. According to Lahren, it was Biden's embrace of socialist policies and his party's abandonment of ""tradition, family and faith"" that drove away the growing voting bloc.

"" As it turns out, Latino voters seem to be far less concerned about the media’s assessment of Donald Trump’s character and far more concerned with becoming a socialist nation,"" Lahren said.

""Perhaps because many of those voters, especially in Florida, know a thing or two about socialism and understand that people flee from it, not to it.""

According to the Pew Research Center, for the first time ever, Latinos are expected to be the nation's largest racial or ethnic minority in a U.S. presidential election. According to Politico, the Trump camp has spent $3.1 million on Spanish-language TV ads in comparison with Biden's $4.2 million.

MEDIA 'CRIED WOLF' ABOUT TRUMP FOR YEARS, NON-WHITE VOTERS STOPPED LISTENING

""This shift is great news for the conservative movement and a great lesson to other Republicans with presidential aspirations. You don’t have to kiss butt and pander; your policies speak for themselves,"" Lahren said.

""And,"" she continued, ""maybe this is even bigger than that. Maybe this information will help put an end to the incessant virtue-signaling and reliance on identity politics the Democrats love so much.

""I would take that as a win.""

Dems flip GOP seat in Georgia in first big pickup,['Marisa Schultz'],"Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux flipped a red seat in a suburban Atlanta congressional race that was called Friday, marking the first big pickup for Democrats after a string of unexpected losses.

Bourdeaux, a college professor, beat Republican emergency room physician Rich McCormick in Georgia's 7th Congressional District. Bourdeaux had come close to winning the seat in 2018 against GOP Rep. Rob Woodall, R-Ga. But she secured her victory two years later after Woodall didn't seek re-election and McCormick, a first-time candidate and Marine Corps veteran, became the Republican nominee.

PELOSI FORMALLY ANNOUNCES HER RUN FOR HOUSE SPEAKER AGAIN, ASKS FOR SUPPORT

""Three years ago, I stepped up to take on a four-term incumbent,"" Bourdeaux tweeted. ""They said this district could never be won by a Democrat, but we knew better. Together, we put this race on the map. Today, we finished the job.""

It’s the first time a Democrat has won the seat since Buddy Darden lost to Republican Bob Barr in the 1994 GOP takeover of the U.S. House, and reflects the rapidly diversifying population of the district.

The margin of Bourdeaux's victory was 51% to 49%.

WHERE THINGS STAND IN THE HOUSE

News of the win was a bright spot for Democrats after a tough week. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Cheri Bustos, head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, had gone into Election Day saying they would expand their majority in the House by flipping red districts President Trump carried four years ago.

Instead, their projections and polling turned out wrong, and Republicans won back a handful of swing seats that Democrats took in 2018.

As of 4 p.m. ET Friday, Democrats had won 212 seats and Republicans had secured 194 seats. Democrats had a net loss of four seats. There are 29 races that have not yet been called and Republicans are optimistic about more pick-up opportunities and predict their numbers could swell to 208 seats and beyond.

The DCCC invested more than $4.6 million to help flip the Georiga seat from red to blue and cheered the result Friday.

PELOSI ON HOUSE LOSSES: 'WE WON THE WAR. WE HAVE THE GAVEL'

“Carolyn Bourdeaux is a policy expert, working mom and advocate for Georgians, and I’m proud of the part the DCCC played in bringing her to Congress as the first woman to ever represent Georgia's 7th Congressional District and the first Democrat to win this seat in 26 years,"" Bustos said in a statement.

John Yoo: Trump-Biden presidential race could be decided by Pennsylvania case before Supreme Court,"['John Yoo', 'John Yoo Is A Law Professor At The University Of California', 'Berkeley', 'A Visiting Fellow At The Hoover Institution', 'A Visiting Scholar At The American Enterprise Institute. He Is The Author Of', 'Defender In Chief', 'Donald Trump S Fight For Presidential Power.']","With the presidential election still undecided, President Trump’s campaign has launched a flurry of lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada and Georgia. The suits raise a range of claims. These include the exclusion of observers from vote-counting rooms, voting by non-residents, and even the counting of votes listed as being cast by people who have died.

But the case that could decide it all started weeks ago, and is currently waiting at the U.S. Supreme Court. The Boockvar case involves a decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court regarding how late mail-in ballots can be counted in that state.

If the Supreme Court takes up this case and the presidential election hinges on the result of the vote in Pennsylvania, the high court could determine who is elected president.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN PREDICTS VICTORY AS EARLY AS FRIDAY: 'DONALD TRUMP IS ALIVE AND WELL'

The U.S. Constitution does not establish a system that uses the courts to pick the president. The Founding Fathers created the Electoral College — an institution that survives to this day — to pick select our nation’s leader.

In the Electoral College, each state receives as many votes as it has members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. California, our most populous state, gets 55 electoral votes — more than any other state. Our least-populated states each get 3 electoral votes.

The founders rejected direct election of the president by the populace as a whole. They feared demagogues who might flatter and bewitch the people would get elected. But they also did not want Congress to choose the president. The founders believed that the president must remain independent so he could stand up to Congress and not be beholden to lawmakers to stay in office.

State legislatures were given the power under the Constitution to choose members of the Electoral College. However, legislatures have delegated that power to voters. So when you cast your ballot in presidential elections you are not actually voting directly for a candidate. You are voting for electors pledged to vote for that candidate.

This system represents a compromise that blended a popular voice with the institution of the states to elect the president — while avoiding Congress altogether. In most states, the legislature has decided that whichever candidate gets the most popular votes gets all the state’s electoral votes.

The Constitution also gave state legislatures the exclusive authority to regulate the “Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives.” While Congress can overrule the choices of the state legislatures, state courts cannot. This is a crucial point. State legislatures set the deadlines, define the validity of ballots, and the manner of counting the votes.

This system can handle any normal election. But the election this week was no normal election. The COVID-19 pandemic forced some states to adopt large-scale mail-in balloting for the first time. Pennsylvania, for example, had 266,000 mail-in ballots in 2016, but 2.5 million this year. Most states have never mounted such a massive mail-in and counting effort before.

Further, America simply cannot make up its mind. Aside from Barack Obama’s two elections, the presidential elections from 2000 on have been so razor-thin that the Electoral College has made all the difference.

If President Trump is reelected, he will have won the Electoral College but lost the popular vote for two elections in a row. Gone are the days when television networks and other news organizations could call the presidential election in the early evening because of the projected popular vote alone.

In this context, the litigation in Pennsylvania could make all the difference if that state’s 20 electoral votes are needed to determine whether President Trump or former Vice President Joe Biden wins the election.

As I write this, Trump and Biden are within a single point of each other in the popular vote in Pennsylvania. The candidate winning the state’s 20 electoral votes remains undetermined.

The mail-in ballots received between Tuesday and Friday this week in Pennsylvania and accepted under the order of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court could decide the winner of the presidential race in that state, even if the winner prevails by a very small number of popular votes. This is not unprecedented. In 2000, George W. Bush won Florida, the state’s electoral votes and the presidency by about 500 votes.

It is at this point that Trump has a strong case pending in the U.S. Supreme Court. His campaign and the Republican Party of Pennsylvania can challenge the vote in the state on the grounds that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court unconstitutionally interfered with the state legislature’s sole authority over the time, place, and manner of federal elections and over the selection of presidential electors.

If the U.S. Constitution directly grants those powers to the legislature of Pennsylvania, state courts have no authority to alter state election law for federal office, including the presidency. As a result, the U.S. Supreme Court could strike down the extension of the Pennsylvania deadline to accept ballots until Friday and order the state to reject any ballots that arrived after Election Day on Tuesday.

This is not some constitutional flight of fancy. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito has already made clear his view that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has violated the U.S. Constitution by allowing mail-in ballots to be accepted until Friday.

In an opinion urging the U.S. Supreme Court to accelerate its consideration of the issues raised in the Boockvar case, Alito wrote: “The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has issued a decree that squarely alters an important statutory provision enacted by the Pennsylvania Legislature pursuant to its authority under the Constitution of the United States to make rules governing the conduct of elections for federal office.”

Joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, Alito concluded: “That question has national importance, and there is a strong likelihood that the State Supreme Court decision violates the Federal Constitution.” In a separate case, Justice Brett Kavanaugh adopted the same view.

Some critics will argue that the U.S. Supreme Court should defer to state courts in the interpretation of state law. Chief Justice John Roberts, who voted to delay the Boockvar case at the U.S. Supreme Court until after the election, admitted as much in a similar case from Wisconsin, where he agreed to overturn a federal judge’s order to extend the Election Day deadline.

Roberts remains sensitive to political attacks on the U.S. Supreme Court. He probably fears a rerun of Bush v. Gore, in which the Supreme Court stopped recounts in Florida 2000 and sealed George Bush’s victory over Vice President Al Gore in the presidential election that year. Democrats and liberals have attacked the political legitimacy of the Supreme Court ever since.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, however, could upend Roberts’ carefully laid plans. Barrett had not yet joined the court when Roberts prevented the court from accelerating consideration of Boockvar. The case still remains on the Supreme Court docket, neither rejected nor accepted for review.

If Barrett joins the other four conservative justices, who share her originalist approach to constitutional interpretation, then Roberts could not stop the Supreme Court from intervening in Pennsylvania or from deciding in favor of invalidating all mail-in ballots that came in after Election Day.

President Trump, who came from the world of reality TV to the unreal world of politics, will then be hoping that Pennsylvania 2020 turns out to be a rerun of Florida 2000, allowing him to serve a second term.

This election’s clearest losers were Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the public faces of the unhinged left.

The Democratic Party is split, and if Joe Biden prevails, it will be because he claims (accurately or not) to represent its moderate wing. He spent his campaign hiding from his party’s progressive agenda, and toward the end even disavowed parts of it. Mr. Biden’s greatest selling point was always his promise of a return to normalcy.

This was a hit on his own party. If Washington has been a circus these past four years, it is in substantial part due to congressional Democrats. Americans elect lawmakers to pass budgets, confirm judges, develop considered legislation. The Pelosi-Schumer era has been day after painful day of faux scandals, gotcha hearings, breathtaking accusations, progressive-fantasy bills and promises to dismantle longstanding institutions.

The press would normally check such behavior. Instead, Democrats and their media allies allowed their disdain for Donald Trump to lull them into believing they’d benefit. The liberal FiveThirtyEight election-analysis outfit in July mused on Twitter: “Could Democrats pick up 13 seats in the Senate?”—an estimate that now looks to be off by a mere 12. The accompanying video envisioned Democrats presiding over a “filibuster-proof majority.”

"Steve McQueen became a born-again Christian, found comfort in Billy Graham before succumbing to cancer: book",['Stephanie Nolasco'],"EXCLUSIVE: Steve McQueen, hailed as ""The King of Cool,"" saw the light before he succumbed to cancer.

The actor, who died on Nov. 7, 1980, at age 50, is being remembered in a new book commemorating the 40th anniversary of his death titled “Steve McQueen: In His Own Words” by Marshall Terrill.

The new release features interviews, personal letters, rarely heard reflections from audiotapes as well as more than 500 photographs, personal documents and memorabilia, many of which are being seen by the public for the first time.

Terrill, who has now written seven books on the Hollywood leading man, told Fox News the star considered doing an autobiography toward the end of his life, but cancer had ravaged his body so quickly that he never had the chance. The author believes the new book will allow the box office champion of the ‘60s and ‘70s to finally share his story.

JOHNNY CASH REMAINED DEVOTED TO HIS FAITH DESPITE DRUG WOES, WAS NEARLY KILLED BY AN OSTRICH, BOOK REVEALS

“Many of these interviews have never seen the light of day,” said Terrill. “I started this book in 2014 and it took years to compile everything together told by Steve McQueen himself. A lot of people have always written him off as just a blue-collar guy who liked motorcycles and cars. But if you read his words, the man has great wisdom to him. He’s got this rich life experience that I wanted to share with people.”

“The reality is, Steve McQueen didn’t really like talking about himself,” Terrill shared. “So when he did, there were these little flashes where he unveiled his true self.”

For the book, Terrill discovered documents that give clearer insight on who McQueen’s father was -- a man the star desperately tried to track down in his lifetime but was three months too late. According to Terrill, McQueen was on the cusp of stardom with “Wanted: Dead or Alive"" when William McQueen, a Merchant Marine, died of cirrhosis of the liver in November 1958. The patriarch was buried in an unmarked grave in Long Beach, Calif.

“I finally traced him to a small town here in California, but it was too late,” McQueen recalled. “He died three months earlier -- so we never got to see each other. His friends told me he used to watch me on TV and that he was real proud of me. But maybe they just said it because they figured I wanted to hear it… I wanted to stand in front of him, just face him squarely and ask why he left us the way he did. It did hurt my mother at the time, and it hurt me later.”

JOHNNY CASH'S FORMER MANAGER TACKLED SINGER'S DRUG BATTLES BUT QUIT OVER RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES, BOOK CLAIMS

After a stint in the Marines, McQueen found refuge on the stage when he gave acting a shot in the early ‘50s. However, despite the fame and fortune he achieved in Hollywood, McQueen always yearned for something else -- and he finally found it toward the end of his life.

“In the search for his father, he was also looking for his heavenly father,” Terrill explained. “At the end of his life, he met a pilot named Sammy Mason, who was probably 10-15 years older than Steve. However, Sammy had a special presence about him. One day, Steve finally said, ‘There’s something different about you. I can’t put my finger on it.’ Sammy said, ‘Well Steve, I’m a born-again Christian.’ And from that point on, Steve wanted to emulate him.”

According to Terrill, McQueen became so intrigued by Christianity that he asked if he could go to church with Mason. McQueen met pastor Leonard DeWitt and later “grilled him for two hours” during lunch.

“Leonard said, ‘Well Steve, I only have one question for you,’” said Terrill. “[Steve] goes, ‘You want to know if I’m a born-again Christian?’ Leonard replied, ‘Yes, Steve, that’s all that really matters to me.’ And then Steve said, ‘Yes. Do you remember a couple of weeks ago when you asked everyone to bow their heads and accept Jesus Christ? Well, I closed my eyes and did that.”

STEVE MCQUEEN’S EX-WIFE NEILE ADAMS BLAMES ‘FREE LOVE’ FOR FAILED MARRIAGE

Terrill pointed out that columnist Liz Smith was the first to report that McQueen became a born-again Christian in June 1979 -- nearly six months before he was officially diagnosed with cancer.

When McQueen later learned he had a rare, normally fatal form of lung cancer, he reached out to evangelist Billy Graham.

“Steve McQueen knew he was dying,” said Terrill. “So he requested Billy Graham to come to see him. And so Billy did, right before Steve McQueen left to go to Mexico for his last operation. They were going to pray together when Steve said, ‘I don’t have my Bible.’""

""Billy Graham instinctively gave him his Bible,"" Terrill continued. ""It became Steve’s prized possession. To Steve, like many people, Billy Graham was perhaps the closest thing that you could probably get to God on Earth. I think Steve wanted to tap on his knowledge. Steve wanted to share testimony with him and what Christ did for him.”

STEVE MCQUEEN WAS PLAGUED WITH INSECURITIES CAUSED BY HIS TROUBLED CHILDHOOD, REPORT SAYS

McQueen was in a Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, hospital for surgery on a massive tumor when he was stricken with a heart attack, the Los Angeles Times reported. The outlet reported the cancer had spread widely through his upper body. Terrill said when McQueen was found, he was still clutching to Graham’s Bible. McQueen died on what was Graham’s 62nd birthday.

Graham passed away in 2018 at age 99.

Terrill hopes his book will shed some light on how McQueen viewed his legacy over the years.

“Before cancer, McQueen’s outlook on life was very cynical,” said Terrill. “I think Christianity gave him comfort. He was going to announce that he was a Christian but he never got that opportunity. But he did promise that if he got well, he was going to make that announcement. He revealed that his body is gone, it’s broken, but his spirit isn’t broken and his heart isn’t broken. I think that says it all.”"
"Ron Perlman reverses Ga. production stance, slams Gov.Kemp",['Nate Day'],"Ron Perlman has flipped on his stance about Hollywood productions taking place in Georgia.

The 70-year-old actor explained on Twitter on Friday that he'd avoided working in Georgia, in protest of their current governor, Brian Kemp, a Republican.

However, amid the 2020 elections with Democratic nominee Joe Biden obtaining a slight lead over President Trump, which Democrats are crediting Stacey Abrams' efforts to register and mobilize voters in the state, Perlman said he's now willing to work in the state again, praising Abrams directly and slamming Kemp.

""To my dear friends in Georgia, I hate Kemp,"" he said plainly. ""He is ugly, he is dirty, he is arrogant and he stole an election.""

RON PERLMAN'S WIFE RESPONDS TO DIVORCE FILING 8 MONTHS LATER, SEEKS SPOUSAL SUPPORT

Perlman is also known for roles in ""Hand of God,"" the ""Hellboy"" films and ""Beauty and the Beast,"" which earned him a Golden Globe win and two Emmy nominations.

Georgia has been the filming location for many iconic movies recently, including several Marvel movies.

Abrams has drawn praise from Democrats for her grassroots campaign that resulted in an influx of voter registrations by minorities after she lost the 2018 governor's race, alleging voter suppression as a reason for the loss.

Paulina Porizkova feels 'heartbreak and rage' over death of husband,['Nate Day'],"Paulina Porizkova is clearing the air.

The 55-year-old model was married to late Cars frontman Ric Ocasek since 1989. They separated in 2017 and were in the midst of their divorce when the rockstar died in the couple's New York apartment last year. Despite the split, the former couple remained living together up until Ocasek’s death.

Since Ocasek's passing, Porizkova has been open about grieving the loss, but now is letting her followers know that her mourning isn't exactly as it appears.

On Friday, the star shared a makeup-free selfie taken in the great outdoors on Instagram to connect with her fans.

PAULINA PORIZKOVA OPENS UP ABOUT DEPRESSION BATTLE AFTER HUSBAND RIC OCASEK'S DEATH

""Friends. Your support and love has been immensely helpful. Thank you all. I wish I could do the same for everyone of you,"" she began in the caption. ""That said, I’d like to clear up some misconceptions.""

The model said that if fans follow her because they believe she's ""a tragic/romantic widow bereft of the great love of her life,"" they may wish to unfollow her account.

""While my love for my husband was steady and my trust in him absolute, I was clearly delusional. I believed I knew him. I believed we had the same definition of 'love,'"" Porizkova said. ""Grieving him is an equal amount of heartbreak and rage.""

Ocasek had cut Porizkova out of his will before his death.

“I have made no provision for my wife Paulina Porizkova (“Paulina”) as we are in the process of divorcing,” Ocasek wrote in his will, according to documents obtained by Page Six in November 2019. “Even if I should die before our divorce is final … Paulina is not entitled to any elective share … because she has abandoned me.""

So the star suggested people unfollow her if they believe she's fallen ""from supermodel to pauper,"" making her more ""relatable.""

PAULINA PORIZKOVA SAYS SHE'S 'NEVER CRIED AS MUCH' AS SHE HAS 'IN THE LAST YEAR' AFTER RIC OCASEK'S DEATH

""I’m not penniless,"" the model said. ""I’m not allowed to share my situation since we’re in litigation, but I’m still an incredibly privileged person with nothing to cry about except for my own stupidity.""

Despite her struggles, Porizkova seems to have a positive outlook when it comes to overcoming the challenges ahead of her.

""This is what I have to face now. Myself. My mistakes. Of which there are many,"" the star wrote. ""And I have no doubt- if I’m lucky- I’ll make lots more.""

To conclude her post, she added: ""#olderyetnotwiser.""

Last month, the star said she'd been battling depression since Ocasek's death, comparing it to ""paddling a canoe in a stormy sea.""

""Depression and anxiety are familiar to so many of us. I tend to be on the anxiety spectrum- which- oddly- sort of gives you energy and propels you - if you learn how to use those jitters,"" Porizkova wrote on Instagram. ""Depression is a different beast, although they are always lumped together. Depression is a complete lack of any sort of energy.""

Unemployed man finds new job by posting huge resume on truck,"['Janine Puhak', 'Janine Puhak Is An Editor For Fox News Lifestyle.']","It’s a full-time job to look for a job, but one man refused to let opportunity drive by, and found work after posting his resume on the back of a truck.

The Annesley man applied for about 100 jobs and went on two interviews, but the opportunities ultimately, unfortunately, fell through.

The determined dad kept striving, sending companies “edible” versions of his resume — i.e. packages of brownies featuring a QR code that linked to his website. No employers ate up the gimmick, but Pemblington’s luck changed when he won a contest to have his resume displayed on the back of an 18-ton truck.

Acai shop's oddly-placed bathroom mirror sparks fears on TikTok that bathroom-goers are being spied on,['Michael Hollan'],"If a bathroom mirror isn’t above the sink, it’s in a weird place.

There’s nothing more unsettling than finding something unexpected in a bathroom. So when a TikTok user discovered a mirror in an acai bowl shop’s bathroom that was placed in a bizarre spot, she had to share it.

WARNING: FOOTAGE CONTAINS OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE

TRUCK DRIVER IN MCDONALD'S DRIVE-THRU GETS STUCK, ALMOST FLATTENS CAR ON HIS WAY OUT

In a video posted to her TikTok page, Stacy Ceja documented the strange mirror at her “local acai bowl spot,” which appears to be positioned low on the wall, almost as if it had been put there to perfectly capture the reflection of someone as they sat on the toilet.

There also appears to be another bathroom mirror placed above the sink, which, as most bathroom users would likely agree, is the more normal place to put a mirror.

In the video, which currently has 2.6 million likes, Ceja approaches the mirror and holds her finger against it, allegedly as some sort of test to determine whether the mirror is a two-way mirror. When she does, the reflection of the tip of Ceja’s finger does not appear to be clearly visible, which is often said to be an indicator of a two-way mirror. Ceja also shared an image from WikiHow, which purports this test to be accurate.

This led many commenters to believe that it was indeed a two-way mirror, and possibly a conduit through which to spy on bathroom users. However, one TikTok user decided to find out for sure.

Samantha Trottier later posted a video of herself going into the same bathroom with a screwdriver, and removing the mirror. Fortunately, the wall was solid behind it, meaning that the mirror wasn't transparent from the other side — just positioned in a very, very odd place."
"More pets than children in Taiwan as birthrate drops, report indicates",['James Leggate'],"A stroller on the streets of Taipei is seemingly just as likely to carry a puppy as a human baby these days.

Strollers with dogs have become common in Taiwan’s capital, in part because the metro system requires pets to be held in carriers, but also because there are now more pets than children in Taiwan as more people have been adopting pets and the country’s birthrate has declined, The Guardian reported Friday.

“Dogs in Taiwan are pampered and well cared for, but can also be an accessory to show off, and the more portable the better,” Taiwan resident Tom Parker told The Guardian.

Taiwan officials estimated there were close to 3 million pets in the country during the second half of this year, a number even larger than the number of children age 14 or younger, PetFoodIndustry.com previously reported.

At the same time, Taiwan has a declining birth rate – down 6% from 2016 to 2019, Taiwan News reported.

The report pointed to social pressure against having a child outside of marriage, as well as short maternity leave periods and low wages, as the largest barriers to having children in the country.

Taiwan isn’t the only country where pets outnumber children. Japan’s pet population has reportedly outgrown its child population since 2003. Even the U.S. has an estimated 135 million dogs and cats, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association, while there's only around 73 million person under the age of 18, per the U.S. Census Bureau.

The growing number of pets in Taiwan isn’t an accident. The country has encouraged pet ownership by boosting pet accommodations like pet-friendly restaurants and hotels in Taipei, according to PetFoodIndustry.com. The city, with a population of about 2.7 million people, had more than 120 pet-oriented hospitality businesses as of last year, such as eateries that offer “gourmet” pet menus with human-grade ingredients.

Taipei even introduced several “pet-friendly” bus lines last year in which animals just need to be on a leash, not in a carrier.

Some accessories traditionally associated with humans have also become more popular for pets in Taiwan, according to The Guardian. For instance, it's not completely uncommon to see a dog sporting a raincoat, sunglasses or socks."

"‘Dallas’ star Patrick Duffy on his parents’ 1986 murders, how faith helped him cope","['Julius Young', 'Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News.']","In November 1986, Patrick Duffy’s parents, Marie and Terence Duffy, were murdered at the Montana bar they owned, and now the “Dallas” star is opening up about how his faith propelled him in coping with the tragic loss.

“There was something about the eternity of life that had set deep inside me,” Duffy, 71, told People magazine in an interview published on Friday. “As horrific as that was, I didn’t feel disconnected from them.”

The outlet said Duffy had been entrenched in deep practicing of Buddhism for 15 years at the time of his parents’ slayings at the hands of Sean A. Wentz and Kenneth A. Miller, who were both 19 at the time.

Both Wentz and Miller were found guilty and sentenced to jail. Miller has been released on parole since 2007.

“That has been essential to my life for the last 48 years,” he said. “I apply those lessons, hopefully from the time I wake up. Even if I’m by myself, I try.”

"Sean Connery ‘was absolutely a great kisser,’ recalls Bond girl Barbara Carrera: ‘The scene was so sacred’",['Stephanie Nolasco'],"EXCLUSIVE: When it comes to Sean Connery, Barbara Carrera isn’t afraid to kiss and tell.

The actress, who starred alongside the late Scottish actor in 1983’s “Never Say Never Again,” told Fox News she has fond memories sharing the screen with Connery - especially when it came to filming their kissing scene.

“He was absolutely a great kisser,” the 74-year-old chuckled. “Everything that has been said about him is true.”

“But he was also a gentleman,” she continued. “And you knew his wife was on set at all moments. He was very vigilant. So the idea of stealing kisses did not occur to us. But the scene was so sacred, so pure. It was so special to me.”

SEAN CONNERY IS REMEMBERED BY 'INDIANA JONES' COSTAR HARRISON FORD: 'GOD, WE HAD FUN'

However, locking lips with James Bond wasn’t always so simple.

“I remember were filming our kissing scene,” recalled Carrera. “We looked up and there was [his wife] Micheline staring right back at us. It took us right out of the scene. So, Sean had her taken off the set. We laughed about that a lot after filming was long over. Micheline had a great sense of humor about the whole thing.”

Carrera said she was initially offered to star 1983’s “Octopussy,” which featured Roger Moore as 007. However, when she heard that Connery was poised to appear in an upcoming film about the suave secret agent, she turned down the part, even if it meant taking on a smaller role.

Connery initially promised to never play Bond again as he was eager to take on different roles. However, he was lured back by an offbeat script about a middle-aged 007. Connery took the role and helped produced the film. The result was “Never Say Never Again,” a title suggested by his wife, Micheline Roquebrune.

SEAN CONNERY ‘PUT ME AT EASE’ DURING BED SCENE IN ‘NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN,’ FORMER BOND GIRL VALERIE LEON SAYS

“The minute I learned Sean Connery was coming back to do another Bond film, I just knew I had to do it,” said Carrera. ""It was a film that everyone really wanted to see. So I agreed to it without thinking twice, without ever seeing a script. I just wanted to work with my hero. He was my Bond. He was the one I grew up with. So it was too incredible of an opportunity for me to turn down.”

“Sean Connery is Bond,” she continued. “He had a magnetism about him that just drew you in. He was a man’s man. He was the kind of person that men wanted to emulate. And women wanted to be dominated by him. He was the quintessential James Bond. I think all the other Bonds have tried to capture that certain magic he had, but it’s just something that can’t be duplicated. It belongs to him and only him alone.”

In “Never Say Never Again,” the former Playboy cover girl starred as professional assassin Fatima Blush. But despite her hard-as-nails persona, Carrera said it was difficult not to melt at the sight of Connery when he first walked on set.

“When I looked in his eyes, I saw Bond,” she recalled. “It was hard to separate the man from the character. But as I got to know him, I saw things about him that were not totally Bondish. He was a very sensitive man. He appreciated music when we weren’t filming. And even though I was very nervous, he was always patient and kind to me. I never forgot how he made me feel. It was magical.”

SEAN CONNERY, SCOTTISH ACTOR WHO PLAYED JAMES BOND IN 7 MOVIES, DEAD AT 90

According to Carrera, there was one thing that she wasn’t expecting from her idol while filming “Never Say Never Again.”

“He was afraid of the deep ocean,” she shared. “He and I had a scene where we had to scuba dive in the ocean. I had never done that before and neither had Sean, I found out. We were supposed to do this when we were in the South of France that first month of shooting, but we kept making excuses on why we couldn’t get together with the instructor. We eventually found ourselves in Bermuda where we were supposed to do that water scene. Neither of us had gotten the nerve to go in the water as it was shown to us by the instructor.”

“I remember we were in our scuba gear and every time I would look at Sean, his lips were so blue,” she recalled. “I kept saying to myself, ‘Oh my God, he’s going to have a heart attack.’ I tried joking with him, but he wasn’t having it. I realized he was petrified. I don’t know how he did it, but we went underwater and did the scene. But it was amazing to see this man show such vulnerability where you knew he was afraid.”

Carrera said that she and Connery stayed in touch over the years.

“Whenever he was in town, we would get together,” she said. “The last time I saw him and his wife was in Los Angeles at the Four Seasons hotel. He was running away from some women chasing him. It’s been 10 years since I last spoke to him. You know how it is with these things. You don’t see a friend for a decade and then when you get together it’s as if time stood still. That was our kind of friendship over the years.”

Connery passed away on Oct. 31 at age 90. His wife and two sons said he “died peacefully in his sleep surrounded by family” in the Bahamas, where he lived. Son Jason Connery said his father had been “unwell for some time.”

Connery is survived by his wife, brother Neil and sons Jason and Stefan. His publicist, Nancy Seltzer, said there would be a private ceremony followed by a memorial service once the coronavirus pandemic has ended.

“I think his role as Bond will live on forever,” said Carrera. “He had this special quality on-screen. You never knew if he was going to kiss you or kill you. It was the greatest thrill of my life. I feel honored to have had the opportunity to work with such a great actor and a great person like Sean. He’s going to be missed. I know I will always miss him.”

The Arsenal player was caught by police on his way home from practice in his Mercedes-Benz G-Class SUV.

“When attempting to rationalize my actions, I believe it was the combination of the empty road, with no other vehicles to gauge my vehicle's speed against, and the misapprehension that I was traveling kph rather than mph,” Özil said in his testimony, according to The Sun.

“The vehicle I was driving has very low engine noise and it is automatic transmission. I am a German national and I am obviously used to driving vehicles that would display speed in kilometers as compared to miles per hour.”

"Jet2 passenger allegedly threatens to urinate on cabin crew member, instead urinates on locked restroom door",['Michael Bartiromo'],"Another day, another allegation of an airline passenger peeing where he isn’t supposed to.

A man who traveled with Jet2 in October has been fined 670 pounds ($880) for allegedly threatening to injure, and also urinate on, the cabin crew who requested he wear a mask during his flight.

Christopher Tooth, 57, appeared in Manchester Magistrates Court to plead guilty to charges stemming from the Oct. 23 incident, which took place aboard a Jet2 flight from Cyprus to Manchester, per the Manchester Evening News.

During the flight, Tooth, who was travelling with his 34-year-old son Matthew, reportedly became abusive toward staff after his son was accused of eating one of the crew member’s meals. Both Tooth and his son were said to have followed the crew into the galley where they became “abusive and aggressive,” but eventually sat back down.

Upon reaching their seats, however, Matthew was reminded to wear a face covering, at which point Tooth reportedly became very angry with a fellow passenger, coming only “inches” from the traveler’s face.

A cabin manager intervened to hold Tooth back, the Manchester Evening News reported, at which point Tooth allegedly threatened the manager by telling him he’d “f---ing drag you off this plane.”

Then, when the plane landed, Tooth reportedly would not remain in his seat — claiming he wanted to use the plane’s restroom — and responded to a flight attendant by asking, “Shall I p--- on you then, w---er?”

“Once the plane came to a standstill, he made his way to the rear of the aircraft to go to the toilet, which was locked. He broke the handle into the toilet and urinated with the door open in view of the female crew member,” a prosecutor told the court, adding that Tooth also urinated in his seat.

At the Magistrates Court, Tooth admitted to being drunk when he boarded the Oct. 23 flight.

Tooth’s lawyer told the court that Tooth regretted his actions, and wished to apologize to both the police and the flight crew for “having to deal with him.”

The judge sentenced Tooth to pay 670 pounds ($880) in fines, along with additional court costs and a victim surcharge, the Manchester Evening News reported.

Tooth’s son Matthew, meanwhile, was also due in court that day, but failed to appear. A warrant was issued for his arrest.

As strange as it sounds, Tooth’s behavior marks the second recent incident of a plane passenger allegedly peeing in a non-restroom area.

"Truck driver in McDonald's drive-thru gets stuck, almost flattens car on his way out",['Michael Hollan'],"Drive-thrus are supposed to make getting food easier, not harder.

Video footage has surfaced online of a truck driver attempting to navigate their way through a fast-food restaurant’s drive-thru. Unfortunately, it looks as though the driver overestimated how much space they had to maneuver.

The footage was originally uploaded to YouTube on Oct. 16 by Remote Ally, a security camera company. The incident took place at what appears to be a two-lane drive-thru at a McDonald’s, though the location of the chain is not shared.

As the footage begins, the truck can be seen starting a wide turn across the far lane. Almost immediately, however, the driver runs into trouble and isn’t able to make the turn. Oddly, instead of stopping, the vehicle keeps moving forward, hopping the curb possibly striking a small tree planted off the side.

The truck backs up a little bit before pulling forward, once again hopping the curb. This time, it definitely hits a tree and may have struck a fence that’s slightly off-camera. Meanwhile, a smaller car enters the drive-thru, seemingly unaware of the truck’s predicament.

This causes further problems, as the vehicle can’t complete the turn without the back of its trailer striking the car. The two vehicles begin backing up and rolling forward until the truck finally has enough space to get out of the drive-thru.

Eunice Kennedy Shriver marries in grandmother's Dior wedding dress,"['Janine Puhak', 'Janine Puhak Is An Editor For Fox News Lifestyle.']","This bride's “something borrowed” was extra sweet.

Eunice Kennedy Shriver got married in her namesake grandmother’s vintage Dior wedding dress in a small Miami wedding.

Shriver recently tied the knot with Michael Serafin Garcia, saying ""I do"" in the 67-year-old gown her grandmother wore to wed Sargent Shriver in 1953, Vogue reports. The coronavirus pandemic forced the couple to scale back their 200-person guest list, (which surely would have included loved ones like the bride’s first cousin Katherine Schwarzenegger and aunt Maria Shriver), marrying instead before their immediate family of 32.

“We were hoping things would have eased by October, but we came to the realization that [with] the way things were, it didn’t feel right to ask guests to travel to Florida or do a larger event, especially if it wasn’t going to be the way we envisioned,” the bride explained.

As for the special dress, Shriver said it was all the more sentimental that it aged with time.

“The dress has aged into a French vanilla ivory, and there are a few holes in it, but I didn’t care,” she said.

In a twist of serendipity, “the bride and her grandmother happened to be the same height and have the same size waist, so the dress fit perfectly,” according to Vogue. With a little help from bridal boutique Ever After Miami, the Dior gown was restored and made modern with a new bodice and ivory veil.

Test drive: Is the 2021 Toyota Rav4 Prime the optimum hybrid?,"['Gary Gastelu', ""Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor Covering The Car Industry"", 'Racing. Follow']","The Toyota Rav4 is on a roll.

The compact SUV is the bestselling vehicle in America that’s not a pickup and also comes in a version that’s the bestselling hybrid — but now it’s going for a trifecta.

The Rav4 Prime is the first plug-in hybrid version of the model. It enhances the standard Hybrid’s drivetrain with more powerful electric motors and an 18.1-kilowatt-hour battery pack good for up to 42 miles of driving between charges in all-electric mode. A fill-up takes 12 hours on a standard 110v outlet, while the SE can do it in 4.5 hours and the XSE in just 2.5 hours on a 220v charger. The Prime also gets 38 mpg in hybrid mode, and the driver has the choice of which one to use as long as there’s enough juice left in the battery pack, which is big enough to qualify for the full $7,500 federal tax credit on plug-in vehicles.

That’s a significant figure because the top of the line Rav4 Prime XSE I tested starts at $42,600, which is $6,975 more than a similarly equipped Hybrid XSE. Throw in the various state incentives available for the Prime and it starts looking like a very good deal. There’s also a $39,295 Prime SE, which is a trim level the Hybrid doesn’t offer.

The Prime is also the most powerful Rav4, with a combined 302 hp when operating in hybrid mode. It uses more potent electric motors than the Hybrid, but the same basic combination of a 2.5-liter four-cylinder-based hybrid unit driving the front wheels and a single electric motor at the rear. Toyota hasn’t said exactly how much power is available in pure electric mode, and it’s noticeably slower, but doesn’t have trouble getting out of its own way.

Aside from the extra flap on the left rear fender where you plug it in and some badging, the Prime mostly looks like any other Rav4 inside and out. That includes a standard safety package with automatic emergency brakes, adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist with additional tech like a head-up display, 360-degree parking camera and a rearview mirror with switchable live video feed on the options list.

The only thing missing is five cubic-feet from the cargo area compared to Hybrid’s, but it’s still pretty big. Unfortunately, the designers didn't carve out a storage space for the portable charging cable, so you’ll have to count it as luggage if you plan to plug-in to someone’s house.

Getting there should be a pleasant experience. The Prime feels like the other Rav4s, which means a nice ride and handling combination that’s more comfortable than sporty. The extra power makes passing a lot easier, however, and the max tow rating is 2,500 pounds compared to 1,750 pounds for the Hybrid and 1,500 pounds for the non-hybrid models. Factor in the HOV lane access that the Prime qualifies for in a lot of places and it’s by far the fastest Rav4 in real life.

All things considered, the most expensive Rav4 may be a bargain.

"Queen Elizabeth has never worn a face mask in public for this possible reason, royal author claims",['Nate Day'],"As the coronavirus pandemic continues to rage around the globe, health officials and professionals have urged the wearing of masks in an attempt to curb the spread of the novel virus.

While the U.K. just began its second national lockdown, one high-profile citizen has yet to don a mask in public.

According to Robert Lacey, author of ""Battle of Brothers: William, Harry and the Inside Story of a Family in Tumult,"" Queen Elizabeth II has never been photographed wearing a face mask throughout the pandemic.

QUEEN ELIZABETH STEPS OUT WITH PRINCE WILLIAM FOR FIRST PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT SINCE MARCH

In a piece published by Vanity Fair, Lacey -- who also serves as a historical consultant to the hit Netflix series “The Crown"" -- pointed out that the 94-year-old monarch's family members, including Prince Charles and Prince William, have all worn masks ""since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis in order to set a public example.""

""The Queen’s thinking on this matter remains a mystery,"" wrote Lacey before claiming: ""The closest that anyone has come to explaining why Elizabeth II should not just ignore but apparently flout government guidelines is because she wants to show Britain a picture of the magnificent and mask-less times that lie ahead.""

Pointing out that Buckingham Palace has yet to confirm such a theory, he added: ""Her Majesty is holding out for hope.""

'THE CROWN' TRAILER DEPICTS TENSION BETWEEN PRINCESS DIANA, QUEEN ELIZABETH, AND PRINCE CHARLES

The Queen has not been seen in public for nearly a month, last being seen on Oct. 15 at Porton Down, again without a facemask.

Per Lacey, who has been writing about the British royal family for 40 years and previously worked at the royal archives, the Palace explained that the 48 individuals set to come in contact with the monarch for the day had been tested for COVID-19 before meeting with her.

The coming weekend, however, will provide an opportunity for the Queen to wear a mask: Remembrance Day on Sunday, Nov. 8.

The holiday pays tribute to those that have died in defense of the U.K.

""So surely on Sunday we will see Her Majesty honor their sacrifice by wearing the mask that has become the symbol of our national determination to defeat this cruel and insidious enemy?"" suggested Lacey.

RNC chair Ronna McDaniel calls for patience so voter 'irregularities' can be reviewed,"['Joshua Nelson', 'Joshua Q. Nelson', 'Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com. You Can Find Him On Twitter']","Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Friday that she has ""seen a lot of irregularities"" with the electoral process, alleging Republicans were stopped from observing the ballot-counting process in Michigan.

“I would also call to be patient because we have seen a lot of irregularities,” McDaniel told ""America's Newsroom.""

“I have been in Michigan, we’ve been pursuing reports coming in on our hotline, people who were disenfranchised from observing the vote count and some more serious allegations that we’re seeing, so, be patient and allow that to play out,” McDaniel said.

McDaniel said that there is a “canvass” and “certification” process for a reason after an election.

“I would say some of these [irregularities] that are coming from Michigan are very, very serious,” McDaniel said.

She continued: “I want to let this play out and allow the lawyers to look at this, but, it is not something that is little, so, be patient. What is disconcerting is the amount of Democrat-run counties and precincts in the country where Republicans were not allowed to observe here in Michigan. I have hundreds of witnesses who talk about being disenfranchised, being removed from counting centers as elections workers cheered as they were removed.”

TRUMP VOWS TO KEEP ‘FIGHTING,’ WILL USE ‘EVERY ASPECT OF THE LAW’ IN BALLOT-COUNTING BATTLE

Trump on Friday vowed to keep “fighting,” saying he will use “every aspect of the law” as election officials in key battleground states continue to count ballots for the uncalled 2020 presidential race.

“We believe the American people deserve to have full transparency into all vote counting and election certification, and that this is no longer about any single election,” the president said in a statement Friday. “This is about the integrity of our entire election process.”

The president said that, “from the beginning, we have said that all legal ballots must be counted, and all illegal ballots should not be counted, yet we’ve met resistance for this basic principle by Democrats at every turn.”

“We will pursue this process through every aspect of the law to guarantee the American people have confidence in our government,” he continued. “I will never give up fighting for you and our nation.”

The president’s statement comes as races have yet to be called in key states: Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia and Nevada.

The Trump campaign has already filed lawsuits in a number of states this week, seeking access to poll-watching, as well as a federal lawsuit in Nevada urging officials to stop counting “illegal” ballots, claiming thousands of ballots were sent to non-residents and the deceased.

McDaniels said the removal of Republican poll observers was only happening in major cities like Detroit and Philadelphia, saying, “We don't control the counties and so if they are forcing us to leave and they say you are not following COVID restrictions and they are keeping our counters six feet away where they can’t even see the ballots, that’s a problem and that is why we file lawsuits and this is why we have documented it and this is why we’ll have affidavits and statements to this effect.”

McDaniel said that everyone needs to be assured that the process was “observed and done properly.”

Chris Wallace: So far there is not evidence of fraud large enough to overturn election results,"['Joshua Nelson', 'Joshua Q. Nelson', 'Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com. You Can Find Him On Twitter']","There is so far not evidence of massive voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election as President Trump has claimed, Fox News' Chris Wallace said Friday.

“You heard John Roberts just said there is a debate in the White House. Some people are saying give up gracefully, talk about the unity of the nation and concede the election. That doesn’t seem to be certainly based on what the president said around 6:30 eastern last night,” the host of ""Fox News Sunday"" told “America’s Newsroom.”

Wallace said Trump has “every right to challenge the election count in a lot of these states.”

“So far, you’re not seeing the kind of mass fraud of a scale that would be enough to overturn an election that would lead to victory,” Wallace said.

Wallace said the difference between the 2000 Bush-Gore legal dispute over the Florida electoral process and the current situation is that it had a legitimate issue: the margin was 500 votes and there was a controversy over “butterfly ballots.”

TRUMP'S VOTER-FRAUD REMARKS DRAW CRITICISM FROM SOME REPUBLICANS

Trump faced some pushback from his own party Thursday after warning about illegal voting and an attempt to ""steal"" the presidential election.

Republican Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland tweeted that there was ""no defense for the President’s comments tonight undermining our Democratic process. America is counting the votes, and we must respect the results as we always have before. No election or person is more important than our Democracy.""

After Trump's speech, Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, tweeted: ""A sitting president undermining our political process & questioning the legality of the voices of countless Americans without evidence is not only dangerous & wrong, it undermines the very foundation this nation was built upon."" Hurd announced last year that he wouldn't seek reelection.

Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., appeared to accuse Trump of spreading false information.

While votes are being counted in Democratic strongholds Allegheny County and Philadelphia, Wallace said it appears Trump does not have a path to overcome Biden’s lead in Pennsylvania. Wallace said “there is every reason to believe that Biden is going to continue to advance his lead.”

“With Pennsylvania now, the president is trailing by 6,800 votes. On election night, he was leading by a total of more than half-a-million votes,” he said.

Wallace said that even if Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina were given to Trump, Biden would reach the “270 mark.”

“If he does that, and if the news organizations declare that he has won Pennsylvania, then he is the next president, even without any of the other states on that list,” Wallace said.

""After all this is over and if the president loses, he and certainly a lot of Republicans, are going to regret their strategy of denigrating mail-in voting so strongly,"" he told ""America's Newsroom.""

""The president has made problems for himself throughout the campaign at various times,"" York, a Washington Examiner columnist, said.

Pro-Trump Republican strategists told York the president's criticism of mail-in voting ended up hurting him in the sense that he had discouraged Republicans all along from voting by mail.

""Instead, he fostered distrust in mail-in voting and urged his voters to have a big red wave on Election Day. Meanwhile, Democrats, day after day after day, had bagged hundreds of thousands and then millions of votes already in the bag by the time Election Day came around.""

Biden sits at 264 electoral votes in states where races have been called while Trump has 214 in called races.

Biden needs just one win in any of the swing states with races that have not yet been called by the Fox News Decision Desk -- Nevada, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia -- while Trump would need to win all four of those states plus Alaska, which he is expected win, but it is too early to call it because of a lack of votes reported.

Russian MPs introduce bill to give Putin lifetime immunity from prosecution,"['Peter Aitken', 'Peter Aitken Is A New York Born-And-Raised Reporter With A Focus On National', 'Global News.']","Russian lawmakers have introduced legislation that would provide Vladimir Putin lifetime immunity from prosecution if and when he leaves office, according to reports.

Current laws protect the sitting president from liability for crimes committed during their terms, but a parliamentary group proposed to extend these immunities beyond the president’s term, the Moscow Times reported.

“The bill secures immunity guarantees for ex-presidents beyond the terms of their presidential powers,” Senator Andrei Klishas, the group’s co-chair, was quoted when speaking to reporters. “This expands the timeframe of immunity guarantees for a president who stops exercising their powers.”

The measure would, however, allow both chambers of the Russian parliament to strip presidents of immunity by a two-thirds majority within three months if accused of severe crimes, such as high treason or other felonies.

Putin submitted a bill last week under constitutional reforms that would give presidents a lifetime seat in the senate after leaving office.

The Kremlin said during Thursday’s press briefing that many other countries provide lifetime guarantees for their former presidents.

""This is a tragic outcome to a case we were hoping would end differently,"" Los Angeles Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas said in a statement. ""On behalf of the men and women of the LAFD, we send our deepest condolences to Firefighter Aguilar's family and we stand ready to assist them in the days to come.""

NANCY GRACE URGES DALLAS POLICE TO RAMP UP SEARCH FOR VANISHED 23-YEAR-OLD WOMAN

Aguilar was last seen on Aug. 20 after traveling to his condominium near Rosarito, a popular coastal destination on Mexico's Baja California.

Family members said at the time the Army veteran traveled alone last month to Rosarito, 13 miles south of the border city of Tijuana, to check on a condominium his family rents out on Airbnb. The trip was only supposed to last a few days.

When family members went to check on him, they found the condo ransacked.

""The condo was ransacked, tables were overturned. It was a crazy, crazy episode,"" Aguilar's daughter, Bella Aguilar, told KABC-TV at the time. ""Vehicles were missing, items were missing. It was devastating to hear ... It was so heartbreaking to hear.""

Last month, a couple identified as a 32-year-old woman Aguilar knew as ""Fanny N"" and a 27-year-old man named ""Santos N"" were arrested on a highway near Rosarito Beach, located south of Tijuana.

The couple had some of Aguilar’s belongings in their possession, including credit cards that had been used in Rosarito, Ensenada and Tijuana after his disappearance.

Baja California central state prosecutor Hiram Sánchez said at a news conference on Wednesday the two will now be charged with murder.

Fanny N. allegedly lured Aguilar to meet her but then allegedly became a kidnapping target by Santos N. During the botched kidnapping, Aguilar was shot and later died.

In Germany, where fear of trade wars and tariffs has been long brewing, there was optimism on markets Thursday morning.

""The Dax is pleased. If we take the vote count as of now, Joe Biden will become US president. That is good for Europe, good for Germany,” Robert Halver of Baader Bank said. “There is no trade war, the export nations breathe a sigh of relief, the export titles too, there is more transatlantic warmth again, less conflict with China; so the world economy is getting back on track.

As world leaders largely try to keep their thoughts to themselves, France's foreign minister did let on that the Trump years have been testing ones for Europe – which is no secret after Trump's very public disputes with NATO and discord over the Iran nuclear deal.

Meanwhile, Russians interviewed on the street had colorful views of it all.

""I believe Trump would be better for Russia, it would be calmer,” she said. “Biden is a grandfather having dementia. I don't know what it will look like.""

Travous explained that the child was taken into protective custody early on Saturday morning, revealing that the youngster was ""exhausted"" after being awake for much of the night.

Correctional Officer Litteken bought the child diapers, clean clothes and a stuffed animal with her own money, the acting chief deputy said. Detective McClaren watched cartoons with the child in the office’s telecommunications center, where the youngster eventually fell asleep. Deputy Davis, who took the child into police protection, also spent the morning with the little one, until a family member was able to take over custody.

“I don't write this to toot our own horn, but to try and show what sheriff offices and police departments all over the country do every day,” Travous argued. “The national press would rather fixate on the negative.

Election Cake: A brief history of the long-lost American tradition,"['Alexandra Deabler', 'Alexandra Deabler Is A Lifestyle Writer', 'Editor For Fox News.']","If you’re having a hard time deciding how to treat yourself after waiting in long lines at the voting polls, perhaps Election Cake should be in your future.

Election Cake used to be a tradition as American as, well, voting.

Originally, the unique leavened cake, which typically calls for sourdough starter, was called “muster cake” and was created by colonial women to feed to incoming troops who were ordered for military training by the British. (Some early colonists also called them ""great cakes,"" after a similar dessert served in England, the New England Historical Society notes.)

The dense cake was served to militia men, as well as onlookers who flooded villages to watch the military drills.

However, after the American Revolution, the boozy fruit-and-spice cake became better known as Election Cakes, after women would bring the baked goods to polling places for the white men, who were allowed to vote at the time, to eat.

The first recorded recipe for the patriotic confection was written in 1796 by Amelia Simmons in her second edition book, ""American Cookery,"" according to Bon Appetit. The recipe required 30 quarts of flour, 10 pounds of butter, 14 pounds of sugar and three dozen eggs, among spices, alcohol and 12 pounds of raisins. Several different recipes for Election Cake have since been logged, calling for different ingredients, though all seemingly have the same yeast base.

Women – who were not allowed to vote before 1920 – had allegedly also used the cakes as a way to sway the men to vote in line to their interests.

Beyond a political ploy, however, the cake was used as a celebration for the democratic process. At the time, Election Day was a holiday reportedly as large and important as any.

Election Cake has steadily declined in popularity since the early 20th century; some speculate the waning interest is due to a dissatisfaction with politics as years went on. And the cake never really caught on outside of New England states.

But in the past few years, especially during the 2016 election, the special Election Cake made a resurgence with bakeries vowing to “Make America Cake Again.”

Susannah Gebhart, baker and owner of Ashville, N.C., outpost Old World Levain Bakery, is credited with coining the phrase, and was joined in 2016 by San Francisco café Craftsman + Wolves’ owner William Werner, as well as other bakers, in a push to bring Election Cake back. They even shared her own recipe online, for anyone attempting an Election Cake at home.

“[Election cakes] were intended to be served to the masses, to people who were celebrating the democratic process and the election,” Gebhart said in a 2016 interview to NPR.

According to social media, Gebhart’s cakes were a hit with customers who stopped by in 2016, but the bakery isn't selling any ahead of the 2020 election — rather, the shop is taking a page out of history and giving away slices.

""We decided this year that we would not sell election cakes, but instead give them away,"" Gebhart told Fox News this week. ""We're offering free and by-donation slices to people at the farmers market who have voted. All donations that we collect are going to the Buncombe County chapter of the League of Women Voters.""

Oregon sheriff's deputies help hitchhiker safely get to and from court appearance,"['Janine Puhak', 'Janine Puhak Is An Editor For Fox News Lifestyle.']","Need a ride?

Multiple law enforcement agencies in Oregon recently partnered to help a hitchhiker safely travel to and from a court appearance, after learning the man was attempting to walk over 200 miles to stand before the judge.

In a now-viral post shared to Facebook, the Gilliam County Sheriff's Office explained that a deputy learned about a hitchhiker named Marvin, who was walking from Portland to Pendleton one night last week in order to make his 8 a.m. court date the following morning.

An Oregon State Trooper had given Marvin a courtesy ride from milepost 118 to Arlington, and the deputy felt compelled to offer assistance as well. Aware that the man had “long way to go, and not a lot of time to get there” on his 213-mile journey, the deputy drove Marvin to a Morrow County truck stop to shorten the trek.

The sheriff’s office learned the next day that Marvin successfully made the court appearance, but unfortunately found himself stuck when his ride didn’t show.

“We knew the temperatures were dropping and would be unsafe to walk all the way back to Portland from Pendleton, so multiple agencies teamed up to make sure Marvin made it safely back,” the Gilliam County Sheriff's Office wrote.

From there, Office Sgt. Braun of the Morrow County Sheriff's Office, Deputy Redden of the Gilliam County Sheriff's Office, Deputy Yoon of the Sherman County Sheriff’s Office and Trooper Mitro of the Oregon State Police Trooper relayed to drive the man back to his final destination of Troutdale.

At one point during the trip, Marvin and two of the law enforcement officers stopped to take a selfie that has since gone viral with 4,000 likes and 1,600 shares.

In posting the news, the Gilliam County Sheriff's Office praised the “amazing working relations” with other local agencies in safely getting the man where he had to go.

Commenters said they were moved by the tale, highlighting that you never know where you'll make a new friend.

“[I used to] hear about things like that all the time from my parents and grandparents,” one said of the feel-good news. “God bless each and every one of them!”

“Glad he made it safely with your help!” another echoed. “That would be one long, cold walk!”"

"NASCAR's Bristol playoff race is sold out, may have largest US sports crowd since pandemic began","['Gary Gastelu', ""Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor Covering The Car Industry"", 'Racing.

Speedway officials announced Wednesday that the socially-distanced allotment of seats for the Sept. 19 event has been spoken for. It didn’t say exactly how many were made available, but the 162,000-seat track has been approved by the state to have roughly 30,000 fans in attendance.

That was also the case for the NASCAR All-Star race in July, where 22,000 fans showed up, according to the Associated Press. NASCAR and its host tracks do not typically release official attendance numbers.

The July race took place two days after Tennessee reported its peak daily number of COVID-19 cases at 3,314, which has since declined by 75%.

"Chiefs having limited fans at Arrowhead Stadium may be safer than watching game at bar, crowded home, health official says","['Ryan Gaydos', 'Ryan Gaydos Is The Sports Editor For Foxnews.Com. Follow Him On Social Media']","The Kansas City Chiefs are just one of a handful of teams that are going to allow a limited number of fans to come through the gates at their stadium starting in Week 1 against the Houston Texans.

Arrowhead Stadium will be filled at 22% capacity with 16,000 fans at the maximum being allowed into the building.

KANSAS CITY CHIEFS HIGHLIGHT GAMEDAY EXPERIENCE WHEN ATTENDING HOME GAMES AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC

One school district in Missouri took issue with the Chiefs being allowed to have 16,000 fans in the stands while high schools are only allowed to have 100. The Blue Springs High School was issued a warning on breaking capacity limits for a sporting event at the end of August and could face a ban if the limit is broken again, according to FOX 4 KC.

Dr. Rex Archer, the Kansas City health director, told the station that the difference between a professional NFL game having thousands of fans during a pandemic versus a high school event comes down to hours and hours of extensive planning and manpower.

“Just because the Chiefs have the resources to do this in a relatively safe matter doesn’t mean that a high school stadium does,” Archer told FOX 4 KC.

Archer said he supported the limit on the number of fans at schools and contended that having fans at a larger event space like Arrowhead Stadium could be safer than having fans in a bar or crowded living room.

“We want to give it a try. There’s no guarantee we will even have the second game if this doesn’t work, but we thought it was worth trying,” he said.

The Chiefs laid out specific planning on their website for fans.

Seating and high-traffic areas of the stadium have been modified to support social distancing standards, and all concessions, retail points of sale and parking tollbooths will be cashless. All bags will be prohibited inside the stadium, and everyone must wear a mask at all times except when eating or drinking.

2020 NFL season: Everything you need to know ahead of kickoff,"['Ryan Gaydos', 'Ryan Gaydos Is The Sports Editor For Foxnews.Com. Follow Him On Social Media']","The 2020 NFL season might be the most anticipated in recent memory.

The Kansas City Chiefs are coming off a magical season in which Patrick Mahomes led the team to its second Super Bowl championship in dramatic fashion over the San Francisco 49ers.

Both teams got back to work after the clock hit triple zeroes in Miami. But along with the other 30 teams in the league, had to face the uncertainty regarding the coronavirus pandemic which has claimed the lives of thousands and even affected some NFL players directly.

The pandemic forced the NFL to hold a virtual draft for the first time in history. Most of the seven rounds took place from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell’s basement. Fans got to peer into rookies’ homes to see how they were celebrating and even got to witness a few general managers at work.

After the draft was over, the NFL held virtual minicamps and eventually canceled the preseason in hopes of being more prepared to deal with the unknown come September when the Chiefs and the Houston Texans kick-off.

In the midst of the pandemic, there were also some offseason shakeups.

Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Cam Newton joined the New England Patriots. Mahomes, Chris Jones, and Travis Kelce received lucrative contract extensions. Several coaches were fired and hired.

All roads have led to Sept. 10 – the first game of the 2020 season and the start of the journey to Tampa, Fla., where Super Bowl LV will take place.

Deroy Murdock: Democrats are to blame for 2020 post-election hanky-panky,[],"The polls closed on Tuesday night, and Americans still don’t know who won the presidency. As usual, when things go haywire, Democrats are to blame.

Democrats are 100 percent responsible for the dog’s breakfast that the Trump-Biden race has become. They exploited COVID-19 to expand mass-mail-in ballots. In-person voting was too risky, they insisted. Then they demanded early in-person voting. Which was it?

Democrat politicians and liberal judges weakened or abandoned signature-verification rules, expanded vote harvesting, and extended deadlines for submitting ballots beyond Election Day. They dropped requirements that ballots be postmarked by midnight on November 3.

Perhaps bowing to multiculturalism, Democrats have turned America’s voting system into something that even the Third World would scorn.

NEWT GINGRICH: ELECTION CORRUPTION BY TRUMP OPPONENTS WIDESPREAD — IT’S TIME FOR US TO GET MAD

Nevada Democrats got this ugly ball rolling by blasting ballots across the Silver State, as if from a confetti cannon. These were not standard absentee ballots requested by actual voters who were sick, infirm, or away. Instead, Democrats sent unrequested ballots to every registered voter. So, no surprise, sacred ballots got mailed to inactive, relocated, and even dead voters.

Las Vegas resident Jim Murphy was disgusted last month to find 15 such ballots strewn about the pavement at his apartment complex and, sickeningly, inside a nearby trash can.

“I’m sure this is happening all over the state,” he told me. “I’m very concerned my vote gets canceled out by one of these orphan ballots.” Murphy returned these ballots to his building’s management and hoped for the best. Were others so honest? Who knows?

“Mail-in voting is not how our Founding Fathers intended for us to vote. I believe that the Democrats know this was going to happen, and that is exactly what they wanted,” Murphy added. “Sending ballots out to everyone who ever registered is simply nothing but chaos! And it leaves the opportunity for fraud.”

No wonder President Donald J. Trump calls these “The phony ballots that are all crooked as hell.”

Democrats have diluted or scrapped signature-verification standards. Most Nevada counting machines accept ballot envelopes with signatures that match those on-file at least 50 percent. Clark County (Las Vegas) Democrats are counting ballots that match just 40 percent (a 60 percent mismatch). This is a forger’s dream.

Further breaking the chain of custody between ballots and election officials, Democrats pushed ballot drop-off boxes, which sat on sidewalks, unsupervised. Brilliant. In Baldwin Park, California, an arsonist ignited one such box. Mayor Manuel Lozano said nearly 100 ballots were burned or wet. Were these ballots legitimate, or did fraudsters complete mass-mail ballots on behalf of dead or relocated voters? Who knows?

In Boston, a derelict named Worldly Armand allegedly torched a drop box near Copley Square. Among 122 ballots involved, 35 were too torched to tabulate.

Nice work, Democrats.

With no poll workers to guard them, at least three dozen ballots were found in bags of stolen mail tossed into a Seattle-area ditch, according to Washington State officials. Near Louisville, Kentucky, 112 absentee ballots headed for Zip code 40299 were discovered in a dumpster. Authorities charged a now-dismissed Postal Service employee. While the blank ballots eventually got delivered, how many such ballots languish in landfills or, even worse, got submitted by cheaters? Who knows?

Skullduggery aside, the Democrats’ mass-mail-in ballot panacea turns out to be snake oil, among other factors, thanks to the inconsistent U.S. Postal Service. USPS aims for 97 percent correct, timely delivery of electoral and political mail. Thus, 3 percent failure is not a bug. It’s a feature. With Biden and Trump separated today in some states by mere decimal points, not delivering 3 percent of mail-in ballots profoundly could influence this race and, frankly, American history.

That makes this news downright disturbing: The Washington Post reports that USPS did not deliver some 150,000 ballots by Election Day. In five swing states, USPS properly delivered just 84.6 percent of electoral mail. As the Post explained: “That means roughly 15 out of every 100 ballots in processing plants were not sorted — or delivered — in time.” This included 2,958 in North Carolina and 3,439 in Pennsylvania. Fairly or not, these late arrivals will be counted.

Meanwhile, the 864 late ballots in Arizona and 853 in Georgia were disqualified. With Biden leading Trump in the Peach State by just 1,557 votes at this writing, the absence of that many “It’s too late, baby” votes could have an enormous impact on the final outcome.

Epic fail.

Furthermore, since Election Day, dodgy deeds have unfolded across Democrat-led jurisdictions.

•California will count Election-Day-postmarked ballots that arrive through November 20, the Friday before Thanksgiving! That’s seventeen days after Election Day and 43 days since mail-in ballots were distributed on October 5. Come on, man!

•In Atlanta, Georgia, Republican poll watchers have been ordered out of vote-tabulation facilities. According to one poll worker’s affidavit, verboten ballots that arrived after Election Day are being comingled with genuine votes.

•“We want all the Republican challengers out of this room!” yelled a man wearing an official-looking lanyard in a Detroit, Michigan, vote-counting facility. As GOP observers were forced out, people in BLM shirts reportedly applauded. In a literal assault on transparency, the tabulation room’s windows were papered over to conceal actions within.

•In North Carolina, mail-in ballots may arrive for tabulation until November 9. Democrats begged for this extra time. Tarheel ballots began arriving September 5 — 59 days before November 3. Was that too little time for Democrats?

•A Pennsylvania judge ordered election officials to let Republicans observe vote counts at six feet of social distance. GOP witnesses previously were kept 30 to 100 feet away, behind police barricades. Some watched the tally through binoculars.

Pennsylvania’s Democrat-dominated Supreme Court accepted mail-in ballots until November 6, violating state law. Postmarks and matching signatures are optional. What could go wrong?

Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reported via Twitter on Wednesday: “Two more batches of Pennsylvania vote were reported: -23,277 votes in Philadelphia, all for Biden -about 5,300 votes in Luzerne County, nearly 4,000 of which were for Biden.”

The first figure is terrifying and demands immediate investigation. Second, 4,000 votes among 5,300 in Luzern County represents 75.5 percent for Biden. Strange: Real Clear Politics finds Biden losing there with 42.2 percent versus 56.8 percent for Trump.

Allegheny County (Pittsburgh) officials announced at Noon Thursday, that staff would handle administrative duties and resume counting on Friday. Evidently, they had more urgent business than determining America’s next president.

•Milwaukee’s Voting Ward 326 enjoyed a stunning 125 percent turnout among its registered voters. In fact, 122 such wards saw participation at or above 80 percent, outpacing Wisconsin’s 72.3 percent turnout and America’s at 66.3 percent. Such stratospheric civic engagement is either highly admirable or highly suspicious.

The great news is that Team Trump will not roll over and lose gracefully. Rather than tolerate these Democrat shenanigans, the president’s attorneys have filed suit to protect all legal votes and disqualify fraudulent ballots. President Trump’s defenders are ferocious, relentless, and righteous.

Trump fans, take heart!

We’re lawyered up.

Gianno Caldwell: Trump has attracted increased Black and Latino support — GOP needs to get more,"['Gianno Caldwell', 'Gianno Caldwell Is The Host Of The Iheart Podcast', 'Outloud With Gianno Caldwell', 'The Author Of', 'Taken For Granted', 'How Conservatism Can Win Back The Americans That Liberalism Failed. Follow Him On Social Media']","Regardless of the outcome of the presidential election, Republicans need to be forward-thinking about their party and the conservative movement and expand their support among Black and Latino Americans.

President Trump has made important strides in this effort. Republicans must build on this and do more.

As of this writing, exit polls conducted by Edison Research show President Trump won at least 18% of Black men in the election that concluded this week, up from 13% in 2016. He received support from 8% of Black women voters, doubling his percentage from four years ago.

GREGG JARRETT: BIDEN 'BLUE WAVE' PREDICTIONS BY LIBERAL MEDIA WERE WAY OFF. TRUMP SHOULD PURSUE THESE AVENUES

The president also increased his standing with Latino Americans. According to Edison Research, he captured the support of 36% of Latino men and 32% of Latino women who voted. These votes helped Trump secure victories in Texas and Florida.

Four years ago, Trump made a pitch to Black Americans like no Republican presidential candidate ever has.

“Look at how much African American communities have suffered under Democratic control,” he said at the time. “To those hurting, I say: What do you have to lose by trying something new like Trump?”

After years of Republicans ignoring the Black vote, Trump’s approach was fresh — and controversial.

It’s easy to see why the GOP didn’t bother trying to woo Black voters for so long. Some 90% of them consistently vote for Democrats. Why waste the time, energy, and resources on a lost cause?

But Trump knew that Democrats had taken the Black vote for granted for decades, so he invested in the Black community — especially once he became president — through concrete, practical policies.

The First Step Act, Opportunity Zones, funding to historically Black colleges and universities — these and other initiatives pursued by Trump made clear that he was serious. And parts of the Black community recognized that seriousness, leading the president to receive some surprising endorsements from prominent Black figures in the final days of his reelection campaign.

No one would mistake the hip-hop community as a bastion of the Republican Party — or of conservatism. And yet, this overwhelmingly pro-Democratic constituency flocked to support Donald Trump on a scale that few expected.

I saw it coming. For years, hip-hop culture has celebrated President Trump as an icon. Indeed, rappers and other hip-hop artists have acclaimed the opulence of his lifestyle and his wealth. Plus, the president has maintained many long-time friends within the hip-hop community.

It shouldn’t be so surprising, then, to see that many people in the hop-hop community still view Trump favorably. In fact, it wasn’t until he ran for president as a Republican that some began to speak of him differently, largely out of fear of cancel culture.

On a recent episode of my podcast, “Outloud with Gianno Caldwell,” football legend Herschel Walker expressed a similar sentiment. He said he gets many calls from players in the NFL who support Trump but cannot publicize their support out of fear of retribution.

In the final days of the 2020 campaign, artists and celebrities began speaking up on the president’s behalf. Most recently, Lil Wayne, the artist who brought us superstars Drake and Nicki Minaj, enthusiastically endorsed Trump for president.

And Lil Wayne wasn’t alone in his support for President Trump. Kanye West, for example, who also ran for president, praised Trump many times and said he didn’t care if his candidacy took votes away from former Vice President Joe Biden. In fact, West had bashed Biden but rarely said anything negative about Trump, leading some to believe that he entered the race to help the incumbent.

Several other hip-hop artists — such as Waka Flocka Flame, Asian Doll, 6ix9ine, 50 Cent, and Lil Pump — also signaled their support for Trump.

Last weekend, I spoke with Lil Pump about his support for Trump. He was enthusiastic and gave me the impression that there are other artists like him who may also support the president but don’t say so publicly.

But even hip-hop artists who oppose Trump still recognize the harm that Biden has done to the Black community. In an interview posted on my Instagram, TI and Charlemagne Tha God both discuss the damage Biden has caused and even say he’s “worse than Trump.”

I know what some of you are thinking: Why should I care if some rappers and celebrities endorsed Trump? The answer is that the country’s demographics are quickly changing.

It's no secret that, for decades, Republican voters have largely been White, many of them older. The GOP clearly needs more diversity. Indeed, the census projects that Whites will be a minority in America by 2045.

It's crucial that my party, the Republican Party, woos more minority voters. Republicans should not change our principles to accommodate new voices, but we should welcome them in.

Trump’s approach has certainly done that.

I have been a conservative Republican for over a decade. When I joined the party, the prevailing philosophy was that if you weren’t conservative on every issue, then you weren’t a true Republican. That stubborn, myopic attitude kept the tent limited.

But that stubbornness and myopia ended with Trump. The president is not an ideologue. To him, the best ideas — what will do the most good for the American people in concrete, practical ways — should prevail, regardless of ideology. To be clear, most of those ideas are conservative, but not necessarily all of them in the strictest sense. That’s a great approach for the Republican Party and one we should welcome.

Biden widens margin in Georgia, Pennsylvania as final votes tabulated Gwinnett County election workers look over absentee and provisional ballots at the Gwinnett Voter Registrations and Elections office on Nov. 6, 2020, in Lawrenceville, Ga. Jessica McGowan / Getty Images Joe Biden's vote margin over President Donald Trump continued on Saturday to widen in several key battleground states, where the final votes were being tabulated. While no winner has been projected, Biden entered Saturday with higher vote totals in four key states — Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania. But all four remained rated by NBC News Decision Desk as too close to call. A call in both Nevada and Arizona in Biden's favor would put him right at the 270 electoral votes needed to win, while a victory in Pennsylvania alone would give him 273 electoral votes. As Americans watched as the vote count entered the fourth day, Democrats have tried to project optimism. “We don’t have a final declaration, a victory yet. But the numbers tell us a clear and convincing story,” Biden said in a brief speech Friday night. “We’re going to win this race.” Read the story. Share this -

WILMINGTON, Del. — Joe Biden on Friday night once again predicted victory in the 2020 race, calling for unity after the final results come in and claiming that the vote that had so far been counted proved that the nation had given him a “mandate for action” on issues like combatting the pandemic.

He Grew Up In Nashville']","As Americans once again look to the Electoral College to resolve another close presidential contest, it’s worth remembering that a half-century ago, the nation nearly did away with the system entirely.

Over the course of the 1960s, a movement to reform and, ultimately, get rid of the Electoral College steadily gained momentum.

“Mere procedural changes in the present system would be like shifting around the parts of a creaky and dangerous automobile engine.""

In 1966, Sen. Birch Bayh, an Indiana Democrat, introduced an amendment calling for the direct election of the president by the popular vote. While others had called for small changes to the Electoral College before — removing the middlemen of electors, for instance, or allotting a state’s electoral votes on a more proportional basis — Bayh called for scrapping the antiquated system entirely.

“Mere procedural changes in the present system would be like shifting around the parts of a creaky and dangerous automobile engine, making it no less creaky and no less dangerous. What we may need is a new engine,” he suggested, “because we are in a new age.”

Arguably, we're still living through that crisis today. We've felt the restrictions of the Electoral College in this current election, as we watch former Vice President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump tediously battle it out for electoral votes county by county. In two of the previous five presidential elections, the winner of the popular vote was denied the presidency due to the Electoral College. And for a brief period this week, it seemed likely that it might happen once again in 2020.

In these instances, the margin between the popular-vote winner and the winner of the Electoral College has only grown. In 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote by a half million votes; in 2016, Hillary Clinton won it by nearly 3 million votes. As of Thursday evening, Joe Biden had racked up roughly a 4 million vote lead, with more votes yet to be counted, but not even that margin was enough to guarantee a win. (As some noted before the election, Biden could have won the popular vote by 5 or 6 percentage points and still had a real chance at losing the race.)

Biden could have won the popular vote by 5 or 6 percentage points and still had a real chance at losing the race.

Bayh’s proposed constitutional amendment fared better than any one like it, receiving bipartisan support from presidents and legislators alike and even passing in the House by wide margins. But of course, the reform movement failed and the Electoral College lived on. But the history of this effort serves as a powerful reminder that it wouldn’t be unthinkable to replace this engine, especially as it’s only gotten creakier and more dangerous over the years.

The spark for the 1960s movement came out of a series of landmark Supreme Court cases that together established the precedent that democratic elections should be based on the principle of “one person, one vote.” These cases, which Chief Justice Earl Warren later declared were the most important of his entire tenure on the court — more important than Brown v. Board of Education, even — involved “malapportionment” in state-level elections.

In the early 20th century, several states instituted new measures for counting votes in state elections, measures that exaggerated the political influence of older rural areas at the expense of newer urban ones. States from California to Vermont enacted these schemes, but the most notorious systems sprang up in the Jim Crow South.

As these states became more urbanized in the mid-20th century, the imbalances became impossible to ignore. In Tennessee’s system, a single vote cast in a rural county had the same weight as 19 votes from Hamilton County. Under Georgia’s program, meanwhile, a lone ballot in the state’s smallest county counted as much as 99 votes sent from Atlanta’s Fulton County.

The Supreme Court had long shied away from “political” cases, but the egregiousness of the imbalance — and the ramifications it had in southern and national politics — convinced the Warren court to wade in at last, articulating the “one person, one vote” principle and implementing it across the South and the nation.

Pointedly, the justices argued that geographic distinctions could not justify political inequalities. Warren explained in one decision, “The basic principle of representative government remains, and must remain, unchanged — the weight of a citizen's vote cannot be made to depend on where he lives.” Heavily populated cities didn’t deserve to be penalized, and sparsely populated rural regions didn’t deserve to be rewarded. “Legislators represent people,” the chief justice noted, “not trees or acres.”

“Legislators represent people,” the chief justice noted, “not trees or acres.”

The logic of the court’s rulings at the state level applied to nationwide presidential contests, of course, but the Electoral College’s place in the Constitution meant a change could only come through a constitutional amendment. That’s where Bayh came in.

In 1966, Bayh had a track record with constitutional amendments, successfully shepherding the 25th Amendment on presidential succession through Congress and through ratification by the states. The new proposal proved popular, too. In 1967, for instance, the Gallup Poll reported that 65 percent of Americans favored replacing the Electoral College with a new system in which the president was directly elected by the popular vote.

The very next presidential election underscored the need for change. Alabama Gov. George Wallace, running an independent third-party campaign, made a surprisingly strong showing, winning 45 electoral votes across the South. Wallace’s performance nearly denied Richard Nixon the votes needed to win in the Electoral College, a development that would have sent the election to the House of Representatives and sent the nation into chaos. America had narrowly avoided a “brush with catastrophe,” Bayh argued. Americans overwhelmingly agreed, with Gallup reporting that support for electing presidents by popular vote had jumped to 80 percent.

Bayh’s amendment quickly snapped up supporters from both parties, with nearly half the Senate signing on as formal sponsors. In September 1969, the change passed the House by an overwhelming margin of 339 to 70, with votes in favor drawn nearly equally from Democrats and Republicans alike. As the proposal headed to the Senate, Nixon announced his support as well.

Bayh tried to keep the crusade alive, though he never succeeded. But his warnings remain with us. “It is essential,” he wrote in 1969, “that action be taken before we experience an actual crisis that could shake the very foundations of our democracy.”

At this rate, we’re on a course for an election soon in which one candidate wins the popular vote by a staggering margin — 8, 9 or perhaps 10 million votes — but is denied the presidency due to the archaic mechanisms of the Electoral College. If that happens, the engine will explode, and perhaps our democracy will, too."
"The 2020 election isn't over yet, but why should that stop the post mortems?","['Hayes Brown Is A Writer', 'Editor For Msnbc Daily', 'Where He Helps Frame The News Of The Day For Readers. He Was Previously At Buzzfeed News', 'Holds A Degree In International Relations Michigan State University.']","After what has felt like several lifetimes of lead-up, Election Day 2020 has now come and gone. The votes are being tallied, and at least we can say with certainty that an election has, indeed, happened — but not much more than that.

Do these facts contradict each other? Absolutely. But — isn’t America, in a way, the biggest contradiction of them all?

Democrats, being the stalwart and pragmatic folks that they are, have spent the last three days vacillating between feeling certain the election has been a complete and utter failure, and holding on to fleeting shreds of hope. In this time of jubilation and/or utter despair, heaps of wisdom and sage advice for the Democratic Party has begun to pour in based on the votes cast, counties won, and — most importantly — fear that the data will never fully shift in their favor.

As we wait, it seems like a good time to aggregate some of those takeaways that have been gleaned from the 2020 election process so far. Is it too soon to make any solid judgements about the results of an election that hasn’t been fully decided? Yes. Do these facts contradict each other? Absolutely. But — isn’t America, in a way, the biggest contradiction of them all?

I figured we could use some satire and irony to help process the slowly unfolding developments of this election. And so, here are the nine most important takeaways from the defining event of the year, according to me.

1. Black voters turned out overwhelmingly for Biden and show the deep bond between Democrats and the black community

Biden went all-in on the Black vote in South Carolina in the Democratic primaries in the first step to winning the nomination. It likewise looks like Black voters, especially Black women, will have propelled him to the White House if he wins, thanks to massive shows of support in major cities like Detroit and Atlanta. Black turnout didn’t quite reach the levels it did when former president Barack Obama was on the ticket, but it definitely beat out the numbers that went to the ballot box for Hillary Clinton in 2016. With Sen. Kamala Harris on course to be the first Black woman to be vice president, it’s clear that Biden can rest easy knowing that the Black community is on his side forever and nothing can change that — ever.

2. Trump doing better with minorities than in 2016 shows that minorities are abandoning Democrats

Yes, Trump is a known racist. But NBC News’ poll of early and Election Day voters showed that 80 percent of Black men supported Joe Biden this time around, compared to 82 percent who went for Hillary Clinton four years ago. He worked hard to get Black luminaries like Ice Cube and Lil Wayne in his corner and it appears that those efforts paid off. And in Texas and Florida, Trump did way better with Latino voters — who should totally be grouped together as a uniform voting bloc — than expected. That shows that Democrats should go into overdrive trying to win back these voters — or give up the idea of ever winning 100 percent of a demographic — one of the two.

3. A Biden win will be because of white voters leaving Trump, so he should ignore the left wing of the party

Trump slipped hard with white voters this time around, especially members of the working class and people living in conservative suburbs, as Politico Magazine’s Tim Alberta wrote in a recent article. Biden appealed to them enough to pull off a win in crucial Wisconsin by just 20,000 votes, according to NBC News’ latest tally. Democrats can’t afford to let that demographic slip away again, and Biden should tailor his policies to keeping their votes locked in for 2024. That includes working closely with conservatives in the Senate and the very canny plan to include Republicans in any potential Biden cabinet.

4. A Biden win will be because of progressive turnout and he should swing to the left in response

Biden absolutely needed to win a string of states in the Midwest for a shot at victory, including Michigan and Minnesota. Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar unquestionably delivered those states for Biden, running up the score in their districts. Tlaib, who represents Detroit, beat her Republican challenger by about 200,000 votes. And Omar did the same in Minneapolis, pulling in more than 150,000 more votes than her opponent. If these two overtly progressive members of The Squad can win big, so can Democrats around the country, even in deeply conservative areas. Biden should definitely govern with them in mind and go big on projects like the Green New Deal.

Democrats have spent the last decade and a half leaning heavily on the fact that they’re not racist bigots, but that may be off-putting to some of the voters they clearly need.

5. Democrats shouldn’t focus so much on identity politics over economics

Democrats have spent the last decade and a half leaning heavily on the fact that they’re not racist bigots, but that may be off-putting to some of the voters they clearly need. In some analyses, the decision to focus on things like Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ rights distracted from any effective economic message. Claire McCaskill, former senator from Missouri, said in an appearance on MSNBC on Wednesday that the GOP had “adroitly” chosen cultural issues as their main focus:

""As we circled those issues, we left voters behind and Republicans dove in with a vengeance and grabbed those voters. I’ve seen it in the South, I’ve seen it in the rural areas of my state. We’ve got to the meat and potatoes issues, we’ve got to get back to the issues where we’re taking care of their families.""

(McCaskill apologized via Twitter on Wednesday for her word choices during that segment, including referring to “transsexuals.”) But failing to completely crush the GOP in the middle of an economic crisis clearly shows that that Democrats aren’t highlighting economic policies that would make inroads to working-class voters. Constant screaming into a metaphorical megaphone about big-budget investment in the American people, following the model of the New Deal, is exactly what the Democrats need.

6. House Democrats lost seats because of ""socialism""

Thursday’s call between members of the House Democratic Caucus was … rough. In what was supposed to be a blowout year, Democrats actually seem on track to lose as many as a dozen seats in the lower chamber, keeping the majority but by a smaller margin.

Rep. Abigail Spanberger reportedly implored her colleagues to stop talking about socialism and called the House’s strategy a “failure.” (She also reportedly said that if they ran the same strategy in 2022, Democrats will be “f---ing torn apart again.”) Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell agreed. She lost her seat after her opponent called her a socialist, dragging her down among Cuban and Venezuelan voters despite her denunciations of Communism.

Also earlier in the call Debbie Mucarsel-Powell who lost her race was crying , and mentioned how people can’t pronounce her name, and said stop being negative on Twitter — Erica Werner (@ericawerner) November 5, 2020

Democrats need to move wholeheartedly away from leftist policies and big spending if they want a chance of holding onto the House in 2022.

7. Moderate Democrats lost seats because they didn’t stand for anything

Many of the House Democrats who lost their seats did so in districts where they ran as solid moderates, barely distinguishing themselves from their opponent. Both Rep. Kendra Horn and her challenger, state senator Stephanie Bice, played up their moderate credentials in the race to represent Oklahoma City’s congressional district. Bice won her primary by noting that she was more moderate than her opponents, before attacking Horn as not being an independent voice in Congress.

Horn, as The New York Times wrote, “had also upheld her moderate credentials and her willingness to break with her party, including rejecting Democratic stimulus proposals for being too costly and partisan.” In the end, Horn lost after winning the seat in 2018, leaving Democrats with no representatives from the state once again. Democrats can’t lean on centrism if they hope to win races in the 2022 midterms.

Democrats can’t lean on centrism if they hope to win races in the 2022 midterms.

8. Moderate Democrats won their seats because they were national security focused

National Journalist columnist Josh Kraushaar pointed out on Twitter that Democratic congresswomen with national security backgrounds outperformed the rest of their counterparts. Moderates like Michigan’s Elissa Slotkin, New Jersey’s Mikie Sherrill, and Virginia’s Spanberger serve as a “model” for the Democratic Party going forward, Kraushaar noted.

Some of the strongest Dem downballot performers -- in a disappointing night for Congressional Dems -- were the Dem women w/ national security backgrounds.



Slotkin, Spanberger, Luria, Sherrill re-elected with big wins in tough districts. They're a model for D party going forward. — Josh Kraushaar (@HotlineJosh) November 5, 2020

Sure, Slotkin went out and campaigned in her district and championed health care and held socially distant events unlike some of her counterparts, but that CIA service? I mean, it had to do something good there, right? Democrats clearly need to focus more on getting women who were in the security services to run for office.

9. Senate Democrats didn’t win the majority because they didn’t run the right candidates

Democrats were supposed to be cruising toward January with control of the Senate returned for the first time since 2014. Instead, they’re left hoping that two seats in Georgia go to a run-off that maybe, maybe gets them to 50 members in the 117th Congress. Clearly, this has more to do with the candidates that the Democrats ran than any deficiency in the structure of the Senate itself.

That includes Amy McGrath, who lost in her race against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky. Because everyone knows that a moderate woman who’s a former Air Force pilot isn’t going to fly in that state. The same is true in Montana, where Sen. Steve Daines kept his seat: Why would you expect a popular governor with moderate policies to do well against an incumbent Republican who most people outside the state would need a name tag to identify? This failing is clearly on the shoulders of the candidates themselves — the Senate .

As you can see, the path for Democrats moving forward is clear: They need to stop doing bad things during elections and start doing smart things. With an abundance of discordant lessons like the above, how could the Democrats possible go astray? Onward to 2024!"
White women didn't desert Trump in the election. Polls show some white men did.,"['Liz Plank', 'An Msnbc Columnist', 'Award-Winning Journalist', 'Author', 'Was The Host Of', 'Positive Spin.', 'Her Book']","The ballots are still being counted in this year’s record voter turnout election, and so far we have an electoral map that looks a lot more like election 2016 than the polls (or, the “poles” if you go by President Donald Trump's tweets) projected.

But one thing that does look different in 2020 is a significant narrowing of the gender gap. While one would assume it’s because more white women with college degrees voted for former Vice President Joe Biden, it appears, in fact, to have more to do with the white men who did not vote for Trump this time around.

White men were the reason Donald Trump became president, and four years later it appears they’re a key reason this election is so very close.

While there has been a lot of chatter about white women, infamously labeled “wine moms,” deserting Trump, embarking on an apology tour and promising to kick him out of office, that trend doesn’t seem to have materialized in the exit polls so far. Based on the exit poll data we have, which, it must be noted, is preliminary and can be flawed, more white women seemed to have voted for Trump than they did in 2016. White women, and especially those without college degrees, have shown time and time again that they are one of the most loyal voting blocs for Republicans (even when they say they find their candidate disgusting and sexist).

Again, exit polls can be flawed; according to data journalist Mona Chalabi, they can be more or less trusted if interpreted with at least a 5 percent margin of error.

But what’s surprising here is not white women’s unflagging devotion to Trump, but white men’s apparent desertion of him. One of the most surprising trends in the exit polls was that Trump seems to have gained traction with every single demographic of voters, with the exception of white men.

As NBC News reported, Joe Biden’s win in certain states can be attributed to white women with a college degree and voters of color, but “it was his relative strength among white men without a college degree, though, that helped put him over the top” in those states.

A trend of white men turning their back on Trump is surprising because he deliberately and shamelessly — and by all appearances, successfully — has painted himself as both their champion and their savior. I noticed this trend and wrote about it a few weeks before the election after having numerous conversations with recovering white Republican men who were fed up with Trump.

Now we have the exit polls to support it. White men were Trump’s firewall, and that firewall appears to be been usurped. In other words, white men were the reason Trump became president, and four years later it appears they’re a key reason this election is so very close.

According to Jackson Katz, masculinity studies expert, author and creator of the film “The Man Card: White male identity politics from Nixon to Trump,”white men peeling away from Trump can be explained by the same phenomenon that led men toward light beer in the 1970s, after beer companies famously used hypermasculine football players in their advertisements.

White men peeling away from Trump can be explained by the same phenomenon that led men toward light beer in the 1990s, after beer companies famously used hypermasculine football players in their advertisements.

Seeing tough men drinking light beer on screen gave men permission to associate themselves with a product commercially reserved for women. Katz refers to this behavioral concept as a “permission structure” and he says it applies to white men dissenting from Trump because the high-status men who publicly abandoned him gave them license to do it, too.

“A lot of prominent men, including white men, publicly criticized Trump, whether it’s military generals, national security state officials and former Republican operatives ... like the Lincoln Project,” Katz explained. “If you have men who have traditional masculine credentials that say that they do not support Donald Trump and in fact think that he is a bad leader, it gives cover to men,” he said. “These men gave permission to men to say ‘you can be a man and be against Trump.’”

Trump’s ineptitude when it came to controlling the coronavirus may have also driven male voters away. According to Katz, it was Trump’s colossal failure in his duty to protect millions of Americans from the coronavirus that could have been the mortal blow. “If you want to use gendered terms, it’s the failure to fulfill the fundamental role that a man is supposed to hold in traditional terms,” he said. “In that sense, Donald Trump failed. ... It didn’t line up with his performance of manhood.” Worse, his erratic approach and the fact that he himself contracted the virus revealed his inability to fulfill his own definitions of being a quote-unquote tough guy. “Isn’t Covid an enemy?” Katz said. “His failures were failures to protect.”

Frankly, the alternative form of masculinity that Biden modeled and bestowed upon white men couldn’t have been more distinct from the guy who will be remembered for bragging about his penis size and calling women ugly when he ran for president. Biden “was the first VP for the first Black president and now the first president with a vice president who is a woman of color,” Katz explained. “He is modeling a kind of white masculinity that is a transitional model. Instead of being threatened by women or people of color like Donald Trump is, ... Joe Biden is confident enough to welcome it.”

Despite Trump’s reactionary backlash to racial justice and women’s rights, there’s a palpable shift trending toward a more diverse coalition of leadership, with the 2020 election a historical night for black and LGBTQ+ candidates like Ritchie Torres and Mondaire Jones becoming the first openly gay Black men elected to Congress and Black Lives Matter activist Cori Bush becoming Missouri’s first black congresswoman. White men have a choice: Embrace it, or be scared of it.

Don’t get me wrong; when I spoke to Republican-voting men, they were generally enthusiastic about voting against Trump, but not necessarily about voting for Biden. John Chapman, a 36-year-old who interned for the Republican National Committee and spent a summer working for the Bush administration, told me he felt lukewarm about voting for Biden but he couldn’t get himself to vote for Trump because he was a ""symptom” of the toxic masculinity so many have grown up with and emulated. For Chapman, and a lot of other men, casting a vote for Biden isn’t about endorsing Biden’s brand of masculinity, it’s about having the agency to choose their own.

This election pushed Trump's masculinity into the spotlight. And if nothing else, it may have made some men rethink what kind of men they really want to be — and the kind of man they want sitting in the Oval Office.

CORRECTION (Nov. 5, 2020, 9:25 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the decade when beer companies launched ad campaigns for lite beer targeted at male consumers. It was the 1970s, not the 1990s."
Trump's 2020 election strategy is to desensitize America to brazen GOP voter suppression,[],"We are in the weeds now with this election, counting the ballots as they come in for the remaining counties and states. But as we focus on the numbers, the ups and downs, and the ultimate winners, we should not lose sight of the philosophy that has animated the president and his supporters in this election cycle so far, which is to try and keep the ballots cast by people who vote against them from being counted.

Trump seems to have so dulled our national sensibilities that we are unable to muster much collective outrage over even the most undemocratic behavior.

Voter suppression has been a consistent strategy of the Trump administration. What’s new is that it’s explicit and it’s coming direct from the Oval Office. That in itself should be shocking and people of all political stripes who are committed to our form of representative government should be outraged. But Trump seems to have so dulled our national sensibilities that we are unable to muster much collective outrage over even the most undemocratic behaviors.

A president who seems to claim the ability to select his voters instead of letting the voters choose him should not have even a pretense of legitimacy. But Trump has run a campaign grounded in keeping ballots from being cast and counted. He came out and acknowledged it in late March when he reacted to a proposal that would have provided resources for absentee and mail-in voting during the pandemic by saying that if you had high levels of Democratic voting “you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.”

The strategy of voter suppression was apparent in a spate of cases brought by Republicans ahead of the election to challenge common-sense safety accommodations designed to make voting safer during the pandemic, in an effort to prevent ballots from counting.

Where Democrats sought additional days for ballots to be received in the mail when Postal delivery slowed, Republicans went to court to try and block the new rules, arguing ballots received after Election Day shouldn’t count. Provisions for drive-thru voting were challenged as well. With Election Day behind us, Republicans now seem prepared to continue this effort to keep Democrats' votes from counting, seeking to challenge each individual ballot instead of statewide rules in some cases.

Where Democrats sought additional days for ballots to be received in the mail, Republicans went to court to try and block the new rules being put in place to make it easier to vote during the pandemic.

Before the election, there were already reports that Trump intended to claim victory on election night before all of the votes could be counted. So, it came as no surprise that, moments after former Vice President Joe Biden counseled Americans to have patience and keep the faith as state vote counts continued, Trump tweeted: “I will be making a statement tonight. A big WIN!” Hours later, he subsequently took to the White House's flag-encrusted podium to claim victory, falsely insisting he had won states where all of the votes were yet to be counted, according to the states’ election officials.

I will be making a statement tonight. A big WIN! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 4, 2020

That shameless lie is reprehensible. What makes it worse is the context. Trump has often worked harder to make sure ballots from Biden supporters weren’t counted than he has to win over people to vote for his policies and his leadership. That fundamentally flawed approach, which erodes Americans’ fundamental right to vote, is one more norm unacceptably shattered by Trump.

Voter suppression has been a long-term problem in America, but having a president publicly invoke it is something altogether unprecedented.

Voter suppression is not typically a strategy that 21st century politicians have explicitly embraced. Democrats and people in the civil rights community denounced and fought against it — such is the legacy of John Lewis and Selma — and while politicians who engaged in questionable practices have defended themselves by saying they were using legitimate techniques to prevent voter fraud, they never openly embraced the suppression of votes. That’s a new development with Trump, who has openly advocated for it. Any post-election litigation on his behalf should be evaluated in light of this context and rejected, hopefully by both the courts and by the country.

A look at Wisconsin, where the race seems likely to come down to mail-in ballots, tells this story. Ahead of the election, Republicans challenged a federal court’s decision allowing additional days after the election for mailed-in ballots to be received. That decision was based on evidence that Justice Elena Kagan noted established “unusually” slow mail delivery meant as many as 100,000 voters who had fully complied with the rules would be disenfranchised. And yet, when Trump made remarks in the early morning hours after the polls had closed, he charged that the continued counting of votes was in some way disenfranchising people who had voted for him, charging that the continued counting of votes that had arrived in the mail amounted to stealing the election from him.

Wisconsin is now very close. Justice Kagan pointed out that without extra time for ballots, which USPS was handling unusually slowly, to be received in the mail, as many as 100,000 voters who had fully complied with the rules could be disenfranchised. https://t.co/LO56yjCgnR — Joyce Alene (@JoyceWhiteVance) November 4, 2020

Republicans are also challenging the “management and monitoring” of ballot drop-boxes in Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, demanding that those ballots be separated so they can be challenged after election results are in. In Nevada, the Trump campaign filed an emergency motion to try and prevent mail-in ballots from being counted and are prosecuting an appeal to permit them to review signatures. There are other lawsuits in these states where votes are critical to the outcome of the election, designed to prevent American’s ballots from being counted, because the president doesn’t want them to have any say.

Moreover, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., has set a hearing for Wednesday after the Postal Service, which was previously found to be engaging in deliberate conduct to slow delivery of ballots, declined to comply with a court order that would have put those ballots in election officials’ hands before the close of Election Day. A reported 300,000 ballots that were entrusted to the Post Office lacked a scan showing they had been delivered and states including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania fall within the court’s order. The suppression has been widespread and at least partially successful.

Trump has often worked harder to make sure ballots from Biden supporters weren’t counted than he has to win over voters of his own.

It is worth pointing out that this is not an issue where both sides of the political divide are equally deserving of criticism. While the Republican party has tried to narrow the number of eligible voters who get to vote — whether by restricting registration, requiring identification or limiting voting days — Democrats and their allies in the civil rights community have sought to expand opportunities for eligible voters. They have sued and advocated for policies that make it easier to register and to vote, while pushing back against a false narrative of voter fraud that the president has pushed to try to restrict those who can exercise the franchise. Republicans have tried to impose one-sided restrictions that favor their base. Democrats have advocated for measures that open up the vote to all qualified citizens.

Achieving full voting rights in this country continues to be an aspirational goal. But permitting a president to call, without opposition, for Americans to lose their right to vote to ensure his re-election is unacceptable. There is something unsavory about an official who is supposed to serve the people waging a war to keep some of them from voting.

Trump thinks that only his supporters deserve to vote, and Republican strategies bear that out. We’re at risk of becoming a country that works that way, in the tradition of other banana republics, if he’s not stopped."
The solution to Trump-Biden polarization may be easier (and cheaper) than we think,"['Marc Ambinder Is A Senior Fellow At The Usc Annenberg Center For Communication Leadership', 'Policy. A Former White House Correspondent', 'Political Reporter', 'He Is The Author Of Several Books About National Security', 'Including', 'The Brink', 'President Reagan', 'The Nuclear War Scare Of', 'He Is A Consultant For Spycraft Entertainment', 'Lives In Los Angeles.']","In this most discordant election, a lot has gone awry, but not necessarily in the ways for which we’ve braced ourselves: There was nothing close to the Election Day violence we had been warned to prepare for. There was one coordinated national telephonic misinformation campaign, but it was swiftly recognized and dealt with. For the most part, the social media platforms have handled false and misleading content with dispatch. State and local election officials — my heroes and heroines — did their jobs well in the middle of a deadly pandemic. Civil society functions; the integrity of the vote remains intact.

Our counter-disinformation army of local truth-seekers and truth-tellers has been vitiated.

Still, no matter what is being reported in the news, it seems, nothing will convince a significant number of Americans that the press is on the side of truth, and certainly not that it is on their side. Conspiracy theories and growing mistrust in establishment outlets are testament to this. Even if the social platforms are stepping up their misinformation prevention, it’s too late, because Americans have lost faith in them; and the internet is vast and uncontainable.

Nothing seems to persuade the more-than 50 percent of Americans convinced that the national press does not share their interests and concerns, and certainly nothing seems to move them to believe that the national press sees them as capable participants in our democracy.

In this void of mistrust and misinformation, a counter-majoritarian party, which the Republican Party has become, hangs together by creating enemies out of the majority. It will, on principle, reject the majority’s claim to know what’s right for them. A rejection of elites, marked by resentment, retrenchment and the creation of alternative narratives, has become a bond of will for these Americans. It’s helped carve out a place for them to belong.

And, no matter who wins the election, this trend will get worse. As it worsens, it will be harder for the national media to cover these Americans — polling will get even worse — and to hold it accountable, and to understand what might be done to reverse it. The infodemic will get worse. Conspiracy theories will become cults.

I know of one way to pierce this epistemic steel trap, even if it sounds counterintuitive: More news. Specifically, more independent, local news.

Trust will not come out of a top-down reappraisal of how the media covers people outside of cosmopolises. Remember in 2016, when liberals seized on placing correspondents in red areas as a solution to the early warning problem that led so many to misjudge President Donald Trump’s strength? Those reporters did great work. And Democrats, buoyed by the national media’s aggressive coverage of Trump, now say they trust the media more than they did then.

Stop spending money on political candidates and start spending it on civic infrastructure.

But the rest of the country has almost no point of reference to even begin to trust the media.

Since 2009, the number of reporters working in newsrooms around the U.S. has dropped by 27,000 or so. And most of those losses came from newspapers. You’re familiar with the story: Craigslist, Google and Facebook gobbled up all of the advertising revenue; newspapers collapsed because they couldn’t (and still can’t) find a viable alternative business model; native digital became a thing; people pivoted to video, then regretted it. The point is, our counter-disinformation army of local truth-seekers and truth-tellers has been vitiated.

And this matters most in times like the present, because there is a direct correspondence between the closing of newspapers and the polarization of people formerly served by those newspapers. If you live in a town with a thriving local news ecosystem, you are more likely to vote.

If we want a society where we can accurately understand the preferences and behaviors of everyone, we need more local journalism. Journalism models the pursuit of truth; we know already that Americans trust local news sources more than national ones. An energetic local news revival would create models of engagement; it would allow newspapers (in digital form) to intervene in social conversations before misinformation spreads. Local news outlets are an early warning system that benefits everyone, and over time, might increase the level of comfort that mistrustful Americans have with the reporting process.

And for the question I’m sure most people are about to ask: Where will the money come from? Well, the Lincoln Project spent $67 million to create nifty ads that had little effect and didn’t change votes. But it did turn it into a media company.

The Lincoln Project spent $67 million to persuade Republicans and Biden filled up the Dem convention with GOP speakers.



The result: Biden lost ground with voters of color and Trump won more Republicans than he did in 2016. https://t.co/l64coiGGhA https://t.co/aTFXVSfr4x — David Sirota (@davidsirota) November 4, 2020

Imagine what $67 million worth of investment in, say, Sumter county, Florida, or Mahoning county, Ohio, or through Appalachia could do to seed the groundwork for nonprofit local news sources. Don’t get me started on Mike Bloomberg’s billions! Or, do, actually. Stop spending money on political candidates and start spending it on civic infrastructure.

There are successful models: The Texas Tribune, run by Evan Smith, and The Nevada Independent, run by Jon Ralston, are successful, self-sustaining digital news enterprises.

One media-doubting reader of mine summed it up well: “When you read The New York Times, you realize you are being force fed DNC propaganda 24/7 ... So, you have to go with the alternative.”

In most places, no alternative exists. And whether the national media actually does condescend to these folks by treating them as objects of study is kind of irrelevant, because the perception is that we do.

Pre-pandemic, when I traveled the country helping teach state and local election officials how to combat misinformation, I advised them to “work the refs” — to plan ahead, with their local media, to set ground rules for the types of harmful information that, if amplified, could cause real problems. Almost uniformly, they told me that, yes, that’s a good idea, but outside of a political reporter for a TV station in a major market, there was no ref to work. That means that rumors spread quickly.

On Wednesday, for example, you might have seen a post on Twitter about how 40,000 ballots in DeKalb Cunty needed to be “cured” by Friday, or else they would be thrown out. A ProPublica reporter, Jessica Huseman, intervened: There were only about 3,000 rejections across the entire state, she said, based on her reporting.

This is *false*. This county had 170,856 mail ballots requested — 40K rejected would be insanely high for Georgia, which rejected only 1 percent of ballots during the primary.



The secretary of state's office tells me they expect around 3,000 rejections across the whole state. https://t.co/x37iytIDzA — Jessica Huseman (@JessicaHuseman) November 4, 2020

ProPublica is investing in state reporting, which is excellent. To combat misinformation, we need engaged local reporters with audiences who trust them to report in real time. We cannot cure systemic mistrust of media elites from establishment outlets, or hope to completely tame our information disorder as long as the internet exists. But we can recapitalize local news, and we need to make it a national priority."
Trump's false victory claim threatens democracy. Republicans need to stop him.,"['Msnbc Columnist Charlie Sykes Is Founder', 'Editor-At-Large Of The Bulwark', 'Host Of', 'The Bulwark Podcast.', 'His Most Recent Book', 'How The Right Lost Its Mind', 'Was Published In October']","President Donald Trump has made it clear that he intends to challenge and discredit the results of Tuesday’s election. But if he does, in fact, lose when the votes are all finally tallied, Republicans will face their final — and most important — test of the Trump Era: How far will they let him go?

The stakes were already rising by the time the polls closed. For months, Trump has stoked false claims about massive fraud. On Sunday, he declared that “we're going to go in the night of, as soon as that election is over, we're going in with our lawyers,” suggesting that he would push to stop the counting of votes.

Early Wednesday morning, he followed through on that, announcing that “we'll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court” to try to halt the ballot counting in states where he was ahead at the end of the night. He also tried to claim that because he was ahead in states like Wisconsin and Michigan as the night ended, “frankly we did win this election.”

And there’s the first line in the sand that Republicans have to decide if Trump is allowed to cross. Will they push back against Trump’s prematurely declaration of victory? Then the next line: Will they challenge his attacks on the legitimacy of the result? And the next: What about his endorsement of vigilantism and voter intimidation?

Will GOP elected officials publicly stand up against attempts to suppress the vote, or lawsuits that try to throw out votes that have already been cast?

Will they push Trump to agree to an orderly, peaceful transition of power? Will they allow him to break the government on his way out?

In other words, will Republicans take one last chance to put country over party?

If history is any guide, we are likely to be disappointed.

Will Republicans take one last chance to put country over party? If history is any guide, we are likely to be disappointed.

The Republican Party as it is currently structured is unsustainable. In turn, the GOP is increasingly committed to limiting the number of people who vote. Republicans have internalized the idea that it is in their interest to make it as hard as possible for some Americans to cast ballots, and Trump is more than willing to say that out loud.

During negotiations over a pandemic stimulus package, Trump complained, “The things they had in there were crazy. They had things, levels of voting that if you’d ever agreed to it, you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.”

The efforts in the courts so far to shrink the electorate haven’t been much more subtle. In Texas, Republicans tried (and failed) to get state and federal judges to toss out 127,000 ballots in Harris County. Republicans have also tried to disqualify absentee and other mail-in ballots in multiple states, taking their cases all the way up to the Supreme Court several times.

As longtime GOP lawyer Ben Ginsberg noted in a scathing op-ed in The Washington Post, the Trumpified GOP is now “engaged in more than 40 voting and ballot court cases around the country this year. In exactly none — zero — are they trying to make it easier for citizens to vote. In many, they are seeking to erect barriers.”

“This is not about finding fraud and irregularities,” wrote Ginsberg. “It’s about suppressing the number of votes not cast for Trump.” But, he warned, the strategy of suppression puts the GOP “on the wrong side of demographic changes in this country that threaten to make the GOP a permanent minority.”

That threat will only get worse if Republicans get behind Trump’s post-election ballot challenges and refuse to speak out against Trump’s incitement of violence.

The FBI is reportedly investigating the incident in Texas where a caravan of trucks carrying Trump flags harassed a Biden-Harris campaign bus, causing a collision and forcing the cancellation of a campaign event.

The episode was ugly, shocking, and dangerous, but Trump tweeted out his support for the aggressors, while scorning the FBI investigation and appearing incite similar shows of force.

In my opinion, these patriots did nothing wrong. Instead, the FBI & Justice should be investigating the terrorists, anarchists, and agitators of ANTIFA, who run around burning down our Democrat run cities and hurting our people! https://t.co/of6Lna3HMU — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 2, 2020

So far, few Republican leaders have objected to any of this. To the contrary, Florida Senator Marco Rubio seemed to praise the effort to swarm the Biden bus. “I saw yesterday a video of these people in Texas,” Rubio said at a Trump rally Sunday. “Did you see it? All the cars on the road, we love what they did. But here's the thing they don't know: We do that in Florida every day.”

The effort at intimidation also drew praise from Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, who described it as “ordinary Americans just taking this election into their own hands and — and getting out there and being real clear on what they stand for.”

The danger of all of this is magnified by the fact that millions of Americans will be susceptible to claims that something terrible has happened if Trump is not resoundingly re-elected. Over the weekend, Trump supporters blocked freeways and bridges in New Jersey and elsewhere, perhaps providing a preview of what we can expect after the election.

His own administration could even reportedly become the target of his anger in the months between the election and Inauguration Day. What if he moves to fire the FBI director, or the head of the Centers for Disease Control, or even the Secretary of Defense, all of whom have been named as targets? Will Republicans oppose attempts to remove science advisors during the pandemic, or to retaliate against critics like Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose job may also be on the line even if Trump comes up short in the final tally?

Unless more Republicans finally draw a line they have so far failed to draw, they may doom their party to a generation of infamy

This moment will require both political courage and statesmanship, both of which have been in shockingly short supply lately in the Republican Party. To their credit, some members were quick to denounce Trump’s Wednesday morning comments. Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, called them “some of the most irresponsible comments that the president of the United States has ever made.” Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie also pushed back: “All these votes have to be counted that are in now. … Tonight was not the time to make this argument. I disagree with what he did tonight.” Even right-wing commentator Ben Shapiro warned on Twitter that “Trump has not already won the election, and it is deeply irresponsible for him to say he has.”

But unless more Republicans finally draw a line they have so far failed to draw, they may doom their party to a generation of infamy. More important, they may help plunge the nation into chaos.

Even after a Trump defeat, many of them will still be afraid of offending the base and being the one left out on a limb. As a result, it would probably take a critical mass of Republican leaders to tell Trump that it was time for him to go.

The number of Republicans who have been willing to put country over party in the Trump era has been vanishingly small. In the days ahead they may have one last chance. But tell me: Why do I suspect they will blow it?"
The last months of Trump's first presidential term will be brutal,"['Hayes Brown Is A Writer', 'Editor For Msnbc Daily', 'Where He Helps Frame The News Of The Day For Readers. He Was Previously At Buzzfeed News', 'Holds A Degree In International Relations Michigan State University.']","There are now 2½ months left in the first — and possibly only — term of the Trump administration. This post-election lame duck period is normally uneventful, mostly focused on keeping the lights on between Congresses and occupants of the White House. But because 2020 refuses to give us the least bit of comfort or time to breathe, these next months are much more likely to be among the worst of the last four years.

President Donald Trump shows no sign of conceding even as former Vice President Joe Biden's performance in key states looks like it just may net him enough electoral votes to win. Instead, Trump is, as expected, grasping for any chance that he can remain in office. While he blatantly lies on Twitter about Biden's attempting to steal the election, his campaign is launching a scattershot legal effort across the battleground states to heighten distrust of the official results.

Trump's campaign has already said it plans to file for a recount in Wisconsin, because of Biden's reported 20,000-vote lead. Under state law, though, that challenge can't be filed until the beginning of December. Even former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker — no stranger to recounts — seems pragmatic about the chances of success here.

Trump's campaign is also eyeing both getting the courts to ensure that every single solitary vote is counted — because, democracy — and halting the evil, terrible, deeply horrible practice of counting every vote. A meme swept through the Trumpsphere on Twitter that said ballots that Arizona Republicans filled out in Sharpie were at risk of being tossed. They're absolutely not, the Arizona secretary of state has said, but the Trump campaign is keeping an eye out for any way to potentially flip the state back to red.

In Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania, though, Trump's lawyers are demanding that vote-counting be stopped entirely, so ballots can be ""reviewed."" Campaign officials in Michigan aren't able to access ""numerous counting locations,"" the Trump team said in a statement, prompting a lawsuit seeking to ""halt counting until meaningful access has been granted. We also demand to review those ballots which were opened and counted while we did not have meaningful access.""

In Georgia, the Trump campaign and state GOP's filing is limited to the count in Chatham County, home to the city of Savannah, alleging that late ballots are being illegally mixed in with the rest. Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania — the prima donna of this election cycle — Trump is also looking for a temporary halt in counting because of ""transparency."" He's also keeping his eye on the Supreme Court as a potential ace in the hole to get rid of the pesky mail-in ballots, which, as of Wednesday afternoon, were breaking hard toward Biden. The campaign filed a motion to intervene in a case the state's Republican Party had filed, asking the court to block potentially thousands of ballots that could arrive by the deadline Friday.

And in case you thought this legal battle was set to be boring and not an absolute trash fire, don't worry — it will definitely be a trash fire. With all the misinformation flowing out there, heightened and boosted by the president, expect a lot more moments like this one in Nevada on Wednesday:

Let's check in on Nevada pic.twitter.com/Vm8LEKLdJC — Brody Logan (@BrodyLogan) November 4, 2020

Speaking of misinformation, Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani is on the case, making this entire process that much more awful. He showed up in Philadelphia to join Trump's legal team and gave a presser that was almost impressively devoid of facts. His rambling was so intense that Fox News opted to cut away to project that Biden would win Michigan.

Absolute rubbish here by @RudyGiuliani.

As that havoc is playing out in the judicial branch, the executive branch is much more at risk of directly feeling Trump's wrath. These coming weeks could see a historic wave of terminations coming out of the Oval Office. He may or may not be president after January, but that doesn't mean he can't get rid of some of the officials who have been lacking in the debasing-level of servitude that he demands.

FBI Director Christopher Wray is reportedly near the top of that list. Even after the firing of James Comey prompted Robert Mueller's investigation, Trump still hasn't accepted that the FBI isn't his personal goon squad. He's spent months now wondering with increasing volume why the FBI is being a bunch of dummies and focusing on right-wing agitators instead of his political enemies.

Joining Wray on the possible chopping block are Defense Secretary Mark Esper and CIA Director Gina Haspel. Esper earned Trump's ire for publicly disagreeing with him over deploying military units into ""Democrat-run"" cities as Trump wanted over the summer when Black Lives Matter protests were at their peak. Trump has shown little concern about installing appointees without Senate approval, making whoever he chooses to sit at the Pentagon more likely to agree with him on turning armed forces against protesters.

Haspel, meanwhile, hasn't gone along with National Intelligence Director John Ratcliffe's plans to declassify unverified materials that would help sow doubt about the Russia investigation. A new CIA chief and a new FBI director in lockstep with Ratcliffe could direct the intelligence services more directly at political enemies in a backslide to the days of President Richard Nixon.

Getting rid of all three would be considered a proverbial bloodbath in any other administration, one that could have serious repercussions for the resilience of any remaining guardrails against Trump's further abusing the state security services. But that wipeout pales in comparison to the absolute massacre that Trump laid the groundwork for in October.

An executive order he signed would ""reclassify thousands of professional civil service jobs as 'political,' thus permitting the president to replace professionals and experts throughout the federal government — who swear an oath to the Constitution, not to any president — with sycophants,"" as MSNBC Daily columnist Brett McGurk explained.

In theory, Trump could fire all of these officials in one fell swoop, either immediately filling some of their positions with loyalists or leaving the government's ranks depleted for a Biden administration to scramble to fill. All in all, it's a situation set to make the Midnight Judges at the center of the landmark legal case Marbury v. Madison look like a thunderstorm compared to a hurricane in terms of damage.

As all this high drama is playing out, Covid-19 isn't going to take a break just because our political system is in a state of chaos. It was somehow only on Monday that The Washington Post reported that Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, has been issuing increasingly dire warnings that the country is, in so many words, absolutely screwed this winter.

But Birx's calls for ""much more aggressive action from messaging, to testing, to surging personnel around the country before the crisis point"" are likely to fall on deaf ears. If the president didn't care about managing the pandemic before the election, he's not going to suddenly start caring now.

Instead, we're likely due two months in which the federal government spins its wheels in the face of upward of 90,000 new Covid-19 cases per day, as there were on Election Day. Democrats look like they might have fallen just short of their bid to capture control of the Senate — Georgia's two Senate races are too close to call, possibly prompting runoffs in each of them in January that would decide the majority. Either way, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is in the driver's seat for what's left of the 116th Congress. McConnell had dangled the prospect of coronavirus relief after the election, but without Trump as a north star to guide their voting bloc, it's back to basics for Senate Republicans. A possible Biden administration waiting in the wings means now is not the time for big spending. Not when there's at least two years of obstructing Biden and the House's progressive plans still to come if the Senate doesn't flip.

The Senate's failure to take up any of the House's proposals will mean at least two more months of suffering for people whose unemployment insurance has run out, two more months of hospital systems' coming to the brink of collapse, two more months in the depths of winter in which people are struggling to keep roofs over their families' heads and pay the heating bills.

With any luck, we'll have the election fully decided in the coming weeks, far ahead of the deadline for the Electoral College to cast its votes. That would take at least one uncertainty off the table, even if it would do little to improve what lies ahead. It still would mean a long, dark winter for most Americans — one full of death, disorder and despair — in a fitting, tragic finale to Trump's first term."
2020 election results for judges and lower courts matter to voters. That's a good thing.,"['Barbara Mcquade Is An Msnbc Columnist', 'Nbc News', 'Msnbc Legal Analyst. She Is A Professor At The University Of Michigan Law School', 'A Former U.S. Attorney For The Eastern District Of Michigan.']","Alexander Hamilton referred to the judiciary as our government's ""least dangerous branch,"" but after the 2020 election especially, its potency should not be underestimated. Courts decide some of the most important issues in society, like voting rights, marriage equality and, in cases of capital punishment, even matters of life and death. And while a great deal of recent focus has been on the Supreme Court, advocates for change should focus on the lower federal courts and state courts.

State courts may become the new venue of choice for advocates of change.

For many people, voting never felt as important as it has this election. But as the polls draw to a close, we're coming away with the fact that not only more people want to vote, but also that many people have shifted their perceptions of what, and whom, they are voting for. And that means paying more attention to the down-ballot vote, to the lower court and state supreme court judges responsible for so many of our laws and liberties.

In 37 states, supreme court justices are elected by voters. But when you ask voters whom they are supporting in state supreme court races, all too often the response is a blank stare. State supreme court candidates are rarely household names. In states that permit straight-ticket voting, the nonpartisan part of the ballot, including judges, may not even be included in that selection.

There's another hurdle: Learning about judicial candidates' backgrounds, experiences and worldviews takes considerable work. As a result, we see a sizable drop-off in voting in these races compared to the number of votes cast in the presidential race, as voters often choose to leave these slots blank. Or worse, they guess. I've had friends tell me that when in doubt, they vote for the woman. In Michigan, it has been reported that having an Irish surname helps judges get elected. Despite my own Irish American heritage, I know that a name alone is a foolish reason to vote for a judge.

State courts may become the new venue of choice for advocates of change. President Donald Trump's appointment of more than 200 judges to the federal bench, selected with input from the conservative Federalist Society, have made federal courts a less hospitable place to advance progressive causes. As a result, state courts are becoming even more attractive choices for impact litigation. The selection of judges for these courts has become more important than ever.

State supreme courts decide 10,000 cases annually, compared to the 70 to 80 cases the U.S. Supreme Court decides every year.

Recently, some have suggested that the next administration should ""pack"" the Supreme Court by expanding its current composition of nine justices. The proposal to expand the Supreme Court has some merit. The current number of justices is not etched in stone or even in the Constitution — it was set by the Judiciary Act of 1869. Before that, the court had anywhere from five to 10 justices. Another act of Congress could expand the membership. Expanding to 13 justices makes some sense, reflecting the current total of 13 circuits to which justices are assigned additional procedural duties as circuit justices.

But another place to look to expand the judiciary is in the federal district courts and circuit courts of appeal. Litigants are far more likely to have their cases decided in these lower courts than in the Supreme Court, which accepts only a limited number of cases to decide novel issues of federal law, address important constitutional questions or resolve circuit splits. In 2018, circuit courts of appeal, the intermediate appellate level, handled about 50,000 cases. District courts, the trial courts, handled about 350,000 cases. The Supreme Court, in contrast, handled only 76 in its October 2018 term.

The Judicial Conference of the United States, the policymaking body of the federal judiciary, is advocating for 78 more seats at the circuit and district court levels to address the expanding caseloads across the country. More judges, it argues, are needed to reduce delays in deciding cases. The next president would have the opportunity to fill these seats with judges who reflect his worldview.

The Judicial Conference of the United States is advocating for 78 more seats at the circuit and district court levels to address the expanding caseloads across the country.

In addition to federal courts, another potential focus for change is in state courts, which decide vastly more cases than federal courts. According to a Brennan Center report, state courts decide 95 percent of all cases in the United States. State supreme courts decide 10,000 cases annually, compared to the 70 to 80 cases the U.S. Supreme Court decides every year. And these cases are of great significance. In recent years, state supreme courts have decided cases involving reproductive rights, medical malpractice and gerrymandering.

In the absence of information about judicial candidates, special interests have filled the void. In the 2017-18 campaign cycle, special interest groups outspent individual state supreme court candidates and, in some states, their political parties, accounting for 27 percent of spending.

Lower-level state courts make important decisions, as well. Trial courts and intermediate courts of appeal handle more cases than state supreme courts, which often take cases only as a matter of discretion instead of as a matter of right. As in federal court, far more litigants in state court will have the final decisions in their cases decided at the trial or intermediate appellate level than at a supreme court. And yet, voters are likely to know even less about the candidates for these lower court judgeships.

Voters and advocacy groups would be well-served to focus on state judicial races, identifying and supporting candidates whose experiences would inform their decisions in cases that can have profound impacts on their lives. The time to begin that work is now, so that by the next election, a slate of well-qualified candidates is positioned for election."
Trump made sure the 2020 election was about one thing: Trump,"['Hayes Brown Is A Writer', 'Editor For Msnbc Daily', 'Where He Helps Frame The News Of The Day For Readers. He Was Previously At Buzzfeed News', 'Holds A Degree In International Relations Michigan State University.']","Progressive policies, the pandemic, the police — the 2020 election at one point or another was supposed to be about a dozen different things in the last 12 months. But in the end, it was what it always was going to be: A referendum on President Donald Trump. It couldn’t have been anything else, because he wouldn't let it be.

“This isn’t about – yeah, it is about me, I guess, when you think about it,” Trump told voters in Kenosha, Wisconsin on Monday night, less than 24 hours before the polls opened. He’d spent the rest of the day much as he had the week before — barreling into swing states to tell his fans not about his legislative victories, or the judges he'd placed on the bench, like vulnerable Republicans down-ticket would want. Nothing so unimportant. No, he was there how poorly he’d been treated since the day he announced his candidacy in 2015.

It was a vibe that he carried with him into his early Election Day morning appearance on his favorite Fox News show, “Fox and Friends,” where even the hosts' most ingratiating methods couldn’t do enough to assuage his bruised feelings.

we've reached the part of the interview where they just let him ramble about whatever (in this case, crowd size) for however long he wants pic.twitter.com/UVcmxJ3Ed6 — Bobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) November 3, 2020

This has been his shtick for months, even as advisors and journalists and pollsters have pointed out the flaws in his methods. But Trump bet big that with his return to the top of the ticket, his voters would turn out in enough numbers to keep him in the White House. As day turned to night and the results began to be tabulated, we got our first real look at whether his hold over large swathes of the U.S. population would be as high as they were in 2016. The race remained — as we've been warned would be the case for weeks now — too close to call as Tuesday ebbed. And Trump has been performing extremely well in the day-of vote — again as we've been warned would happen for weeks — and over performing in some areas.

So, without a decisive victory on either side, the question still hangs over the country: If this really is a referendum on Trump, what does it mean if the American people give him their seal of approval — and what will he do with that injection of pure, uncut validation straight to his already aggrandized sense of self?

In his 2016 acceptance of the Republican nomination, Trump said of all the problems the U.S. faced, “I alone can fix it.” The next four years have shown that through scandal and disaster and impeachment, he has kept the focus on himself, on Trump the man, to the detriment of Trump the president. His tweets, his whims, his moodiness. How he’s reacted to Congress. How the press reacted to him. Those trivialities have been center stage in this consolidation of the nation into one man.

Trump’s niece, psychiatrist Mary L. Trump, wrote in her tell-all book released in July that it’s clear that Trump is a narcissist, one who’s been handed everything but remains in constant need of outsized approval. “Nothing is ever enough,” she wrote. “This is far beyond garden-variety narcissism; Donald is not simply weak, his ego is a fragile thing that must be bolstered every moment because he knows deep down that he is nothing of what he claims to be.”

That’s the exact opposite of the sort of personality that the modern presidency was designed around. It’s meant even in the worst of his moods, when he had hit seeming political rock bottom when became just the third president to be impeached, he has refused to let the spotlight off of him for longer than he could bear. It’s meant taking every perceived slight against him as grounds for a tirade, firing, arrest, or prosecution. It’s meant four years of the world waiting with bated breath to see what would come out of his mouth next as he delighted in the attention.

As improbable as it sounds now, for a minute there, there might have been a world where we’d be talking about something, anything, beyond what Trump is like as a person as Election Day approached. The Democratic candidates in the primaries, all nearly two dozen of them, lined up their best ideas for the country moving forward. Sens. Bernie Sanders, attempting to harness the movement he’d built four years ago in pursuit of a revolution, and Elizabeth Warren, making the case for an aggressive progressivism, battled it out for the love of the party’s left-wing.

A tier below, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Housing Secretary Julián Castro, Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker, hammered away at each other, all trying to stake their claim on what they saw as their portion of the party. Once they’d locked that in, then they could turn their attention to the general election, they and their campaigns believed.

And then there was former Vice President Joe Biden. A relic of Democrats’ past, it was his third time running for president. Biden’s pitch to the electorate was clear: He presented the best chance to beat Donald Trump. It was a theory that he rode to victory in South Carolina, a moment that he and his campaign had bet heavily on, and the state’s Black voters, ever pragmatic, helped him win the state. The delegates piled up as Biden rolled on through the primaries as his competitors dropped out. In the end, he and Sanders, the last standing opponent, opted for party unity rather than a contested convention.

It was impossible for this race to come down to anything but Trump’s need for approval, the same thing that first compelled him to run for president

Early on in campaigning nobody, except Trump himself it seemed, believed it would be the 78-year-old man from Scranton on the ticket. Trump had gone as far as attempting to bribe Ukraine’s president to handicap Biden, an act that got him impeached. But Biden pulled it off. The general election was set in a showdown between two extremely different men (despite their similar ages.)

Then in March, the pandemic hit, upending the race, and the country. Trump quickly determined that this was an opportunity to get back into the spotlight. His daily press briefings quickly morphed from a way to present updates to a scared populace, then a substitute for the massive rallies he could no longer hold. On a particularly bad day, when he suggested potentially injecting bleach into Covid patients, put an end to that practice.

This summer’s protests against systemic racism and police brutality gave Trump a new issue to focus on, similar to his 2016 campaign. His paternalistic message to voters: The world is dangerous; but I can keep you safe. He’s held up the endorsements of law enforcement unions. He’s basked in the support of the far-right, caring little about their beliefs or alleged crimes so long as it’s him they back.

As the pandemic has raged on, Biden adapted to a world with the virus, to his political benefit. For all of Trump’s mocking of his “basement strategy,” it’s worked. The Biden campaign has been more than happy to let this election become a referendum on the Trump presidency, given the president’s unprecedentedly low approval numbers for an incumbent heading into an election year.

Trump, on the other hand, hasn’t changed, even after contracting the virus himself. He went right back to drawing crowds as large as possible, his campaign duping local officials when necessary and literally abandoning his supporters as he flew off in Air Force One. Former President Barack Obama, the antagonist who has lived in Trump’s head rent-free since 2013, mocked him about his seeming jealousy of the virus’s press coverage in the final stretch.

In Trump’s debates against Biden, it was clear that the issues that divided the two candidates were never going to be as prominent as the gulf between their characters. In the second and final debate, Biden leaned into that gap. “You know who I am. You know who he is. You know his character. You know my character,” he said, looking straight into the camera. It’s a distinction that Trump never bothered to correct.

Just as it’s always been, with the president using the language of the abuser, convincing his captive that it’s fortunate that he’d ever deigned to look at someone so inconsequential.

And so, we arrived at Monday night, just as the east coast rolled over into Election Day. ""You are so lucky I have agreed to be your president,"" Trump told the crowd in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It’s a line he’s trotted out several times in the closing months of the campaign. Just as it’s always been, with the president using the language of the abuser, convincing his captive that it’s fortunate that he’d ever deigned to look at someone so inconsequential. Be grateful I’m here to love you, he whispers. Because he knows he is nothing if he is not looked upon.

It was impossible for this race to come down to anything but Trump’s need for approval, the same thing that first compelled him finally actually run for president, especially after Obama’s mocking 2011 White House Correspondents Dinner speech. Trump is a shell composed of greed and ego, the latter compelling his political bid, the former his need to stay atop his perch lest he face the consequences of decades of misdeeds. And yet there's still a chance that after four years of overwhelming evidence that Trump is unfit to lead, he gains a new term and even fewer constraints on his authoritarian tendencies.

The votes are still being tabulated, but it looks as of in the wee hours of Wednesday morning like the race is coming down to Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, all of which are states where the Trump campaign is trying to halt late-arriving ballots from being counted.

No matter what happens next, the country has spoken in its referendum of Donald Trump. Whatever happens next — in the next weeks, months, and potentially four years — will revolve around what he does with their message."
"Trump has found a whole new way to make the government worse, whether he wins or loses","['Brett Mcgurk Is An Msnbc Columnist', 'Msnbc National Security Analyst. He Was Most Recently A Special Presidential Envoy Coordinating The Global Campaign To Defeat Isis', 'He Has Served In Senior National Security Posts In The Bush', 'Obama', 'Trump Administrations.']","When President Donald Trump said ""these people are sick"" during remarks to donors before his final debate with former Vice President Joe Biden last week, he wasn't talking about the nearly 9 million people in the United States inflicted with Covid-19 or the resurgent pandemic that seems to spread wherever he holds a rally. The people Trump was referring to as ""sick"" appeared to be the civil service professionals who devote their careers to serving our country. ""You have a lot of people from past administrations,"" he complained, ""and they're civil service. I fired some.""

The people Trump was referring to as “sick” appeared to be the civil service professionals who devote their careers to serving our country.

The comments spoke to Trump's unprecedented assault on professionalism in the ranks of our federal government, which he now promises to accelerate should he win a second term. Specifically, they expanded on a sweeping executive order he had signed the day before to reclassify thousands of professional civil service jobs as ""political,"" thus permitting the president to replace professionals and experts throughout the federal government — who swear an oath to the Constitution, not to any president — with sycophants. In response, Ronald Sanders, Trump's own appointee to the Federal Salary Council, which helps oversee the professional civil service, resigned in protest. In a letter, Sanders warned that Trump's order was a ""smokescreen"" designed ""to replace apolitical expertise with political obeisance.""

NEW: Ronald Sanders, a Trump appointee and chairman of the Federal Salary Council has resigned effective immediately, citing Trump's recent exec order on federal worker classification changes as the cause.

If Trump wins, he has now ensured he'll have the power to rapidly accelerate these damaging trends. Even if he loses, in which case the executive order would likely not be upheld by Biden, it will take years to restore the depleted ranks of experts across federal departments and agencies, from the State Department to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It's a hallmark of the Trump administration that in four short years it has managed to degrade America's professional and nonpolitical institutions, from our intelligence services to our diplomatic corps to the doctors and scientists in our public health agencies. The president is now sending every signal that his second term, in this regard, would be even worse.

No doubt, there could be more flexibility and discretion in reorganizing federal departments to face new crises. The interagency process can be cumbersome, a frustration felt by Trump's predecessors. (Harry Truman famously said of his incoming successor: ""He'll sit here and say, 'Do this! Do that!' and nothing will happen. Poor Ike — it won't be a bit like the Army."")

But as Sanders warned, Trump's reforms don't aim to increase efficiency — rather, they aim to enable a wholesale de-professionalization of government service. It's part of the broader story of Trump's presidency, which shows little appreciation for the very idea of service in behalf of the American people, as opposed to service in behalf of a president's personal interests.

No matter what, America’s public servants must know a president has their back.

I spent two years during the Trump administration in the State Department as the president's special envoy, helping to lead the campaign against the Islamic State. I held the same position under Barack Obama, and before that, I served on George W. Bush's National Security Council. These were not career posts: I served at the pleasure of the president, like most people in positions in the upper ranks of an administration. But it would have been impossible to get anything done, let alone competently, without depending on career professionals on my staff and in the ranks of our nonpolitical diplomatic, military and intelligence corps.

One of my colleagues in the Trump administration was Michael McKinley, a four-time U.S. ambassador and then senior adviser to Mike Pompeo, Trump's secretary of state. McKinley quit in late 2019. Last week, he explained why, writing that the damage Trump has done to the diplomatic corps is likely to be ""generational"" after ""the department turned its back on its own staff.""

For McKinley, the last straw was a White House campaign to denigrate Marie Yovanovitch, our career ambassador in Ukraine, after she refused to go along with a scheme to withhold security assistance from the country until it launched a fraudulent investigation of Biden. McKinley resigned when nobody at the State Department stood up for Yovanovitch, who had dedicated her professional life to serving our country since the Reagan administration. He rightly warns about ""the misuse of career professionals in Washington and abroad to pursue a U.S. electoral advantage.""

No matter what, America's public servants must know a president has their back. What holds true for Yovanovitch when facing off against Russians in Ukraine applies equally to scientists and doctors in our public health institutions (who are ""idiots,"" according to Trump). We count on them to tell the truth even when it may be difficult to hear or it is an unwanted intrusion for a president living in a world shaped by social media and cable news. Competent presidents seek out the truth, regularly inviting government experts into the Oval Office and asking them, in the words of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, to ""lay out the facts cold and hard"" before major decisions are made.

It's up to a president to create an environment for such truth-telling, which starts with showing respect for the professionals in the ranks who do the work every day. Those professionals need to know that they will not be penalized or shunned after reporting troubling facts to superiors or standing up for American values overseas.

In early 2016, I was flying to Turkey with then-Vice President Biden. We had a difficult set of meetings with Turkish officials, including the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who was cracking down on dissent at home and doing little at the time to stem the flow of foreign fighters in and out of Syria. Biden's immediate focus, however, was the U.S. ambassador, John Bass, a career diplomat who was under fire from Turkish officials for calling out the recent crackdown as contrary to democratic values. Biden understood that for an ambassador to be effective, everyone in the host country had to know that he or she spoke for the United States.

So he went out of his way to make it clear — before he even met with Turkish officials — that he had Bass' back. On the first morning of our visit, he spoke to the media about John. ""He speaks for my government,"" he said. ""He speaks for the American people."" That is what any president should say about professionals serving our country in tough assignments, whether for those protecting us from diseases at home or those representing us in foreign capitals abroad.

It could not be a sharper contrast to the current occupant of the Oval Office, who seems to have nobody's back but his own. That should be an important consideration when voting Nov. 3."
We may never recover from the damage Trump has done to the Supreme Court,"['Joyce White Vance Is An Msnbc Columnist', 'Nbc News', 'Msnbc Legal Analyst. She Is A Law Professor At The University Of Alabama School Of Law', 'A Former U.S. Attorney In The Northern District Of Alabama.']","We tell our children to play by the rules. We tell them treating everyone fairly ensures respect for the system.

Unless, of course, you’re a nominee for the Supreme Court of the United States. Then, based on how the Republicans have handled the vacancy created by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death, there are no rules. All that matters is getting your way.

What happened to basic fairness? Or to Graham demanding that we hold him accountable if he violated his word?

There was a rule, of sorts, that the Republicans imposed for Judge Merrick Garland, the moderate judge nominated to fill the opening left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February of the final year of Barack Obama’s presidency. Obama nominated Garland because Republicans had voiced support for him in the past — Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah had called him a consensus choice for the Supreme Court. Given that he would be replacing the court’s archconservative justice, that seemed fair.

But nothing that followed had even a hint of fairness to it. Republican Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell declined to hold hearings or permit Garland’s nomination to come up for a vote. Why? Because, as multiple senators in the majority said, there should be no confirmations during a president’s final year in office. Instead, they insisted that the people first be allowed to elect a new president, giving them a say in the process. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the current chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, volunteered: “If there's a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say Lindsey Graham said, ‘Let's let the next president, whoever it might be, make that nomination.’”

Fast forward to September. Ginsburg had been dead for less than 24 hours when President Donald Trump announced his intent to nominate her replacement. McConnell took even less time, announcing on day she died that he would hold a vote on her successor.

What happened to the rule Republicans announced in 2016? What happened to basic fairness? Or to Graham demanding that we hold him accountable if he violated his word?

If we have learned anything from the Trump administration, it’s that our government cannot function properly when people lose confidence in it.

We live in a country where the rules are supposed to apply equally to everyone. There isn’t supposed to be one set of rules for Democrats and another for Republicans. Nowhere is basic procedural fairness more important than at the Supreme Court, the institution charged with upholding the rule of law. Confirming a justice in a process devoid of even the appearance of integrity will inevitably diminish public confidence in the court.

The words “Equal Justice Under Law"" are written in large letters over the entrance to the Supreme Court, a constant reminder that it is the place where people go to have their most difficult and controversial disputes resolved. Every case before the court has winners and losers, but losing parties abide by the court’s decisions. Even disgruntled litigants understand that the justices uphold the oath they take, which requires them to“faithfully and impartially discharge and perform” all of their duties. In other words, the justices play by the rules and so must the people who come before them.

Despite the criticism of Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s performance at her confirmation hearing, concerns over what her confirmation portends for the Supreme Court’s future have more to do with the institution’s loss of legitimacy than her inability to name all five of the protections guaranteed by the First Amendment. The process that brings her to the verge of confirmation for a lifetime appointment is transparently rank. It is a bald political power play unbefitting the Supreme Court and the justices who serve on it. It dishonors Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who served the country so faithfully.

Senate Republicans cannot treat the nominations of Merrick Garland and Amy Coney Barrett differently and maintain the intellectual honesty of the confirmation process. And that’s what the court is supposed to be about, intellectual honesty on the toughest calls we face in our society. Many of Barrett’s own former Notre Dame colleagues called upon her to reject a process that was so blatantly opportunistic and demand that her “nomination be suspended until after the election.” Eighty eight of them pleaded with her to recognize the “treacherous moment in the United States” and that “the politics of your nomination, as you surely understand, will further inflame our civic wounds, undermine confidence in the court, and deepen the divide among ordinary citizens.”

Instead of a routine confirmation hearing, where statements were made and polite if sometimes pointed questions were asked, we need more outrage over the process that brought us here.

In 2018, Graham reaffirmed his commitment that no justices should be confirmed during a president’s last year in office, saying ""If an opening comes in the last year of President Trump's term, and the primary process has started, we’ll wait till the next election."" Today, we are well past the primary process. More than 33 million Americans have already voted in the 2020 presidential race. Nonetheless Barrett’s confirmation seems all but assured.

If we have learned anything from the Trump administration, it’s that our government cannot function properly when people lose confidence in it. Trust is the essential foundation for the legitimacy of democratic institutions. And given the perilous times we face, it’s likely that institutional legitimacy is more critical at the Supreme Court than anywhere else.

We won’t get that kind of legitimacy if Barrett is confirmed before we know the results of the election. The president himself has weighed in, saying he needs a ninth justice to decide the outcome of the election, which he says he believes is headed to the courts. Despite the president’s statement, Barrett declined to say during her confirmation hearing whether she would recuse herself from matters involving the outcome of the election.

Our country has witnessed so much that is not normal during the Trump administration. It is our new (ab)normal to see the attorney general act as the president’s lawyer, not the people’s, or to watch an inspector general be fired for investigating a member of the administration. We are, regrettably, becoming numb. But letting Trump damage the Supreme Court’s integrity, even as he implies he will ask them to intervene in the electoral process, is an entirely different level of damage to our institutions.

Instead of a routine confirmation hearing, where statements were made and polite if sometimes pointed questions were asked, we need more outrage over the process that brought us here. On Thursday, in the shadow of the election, the Senate Judiciary Committee will vote on Barrett’s nomination. We are at risk of losing the Supreme Court’s legitimacy at a time when the court and the country need it most."
What happens when Trump sides with enemies of the state? America may find out.,"['Ali Velshi Is An Msnbc Columnist', 'The Host Of', 'Velshi', 'Which Airs Saturdays', 'Sundays On Msnbc. He Has Been Awarded The National Headliner Award For Business', 'Consumer Reporting For', 'How The Wheels Came Off', 'A Special On The Near Collapse Of The American Auto Industry. His Work On Disabled Workers', 'Chicago S Red-Light Camera Scandal In Earned Him Two News', 'Documentary Emmy Award Nominations']","A ""particular strain of Vanilla ISIS"" — that's how terrorism expert Malcolm Nance described groups like the self-proclaimed ""militia"" that authorities say took part in what they said was a plot to abduct Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. ""They exist in a fantasy world,"" Nance said. According to the 2020 Homeland Threat Assessment published early this month by the Department of Homeland Security, ""ideologically motivated lone offenders and small groups will pose the greatest terrorist threat to the homeland, with domestic violent extremists presenting the most persistent and lethal threat.""

But with President Donald Trump failing to separate himself from racists, white nationalists and conspiracy theorists, the lines between a militant fantasy and reality are getting awful blurry. Trump is courting danger by playing footsie with armed paramilitary groups, potentially encouraging violence and, by doing so, openly encouraging potential illegal activity, since it is illegal for armed private citizens to try to enforce laws or enact new ones.

Trump's lack of full-throated, robust responses to alleged members of a Michigan militia who, allegedly, were plotting the abduction, unlawful extradition and ""trial"" of Whitmer, as well as to attacks on the Michigan State Capitol and a police station, has many wondering what he is signaling by avoiding criticizing those groups. And what Trump doesn't say can be equally as dangerous; in any other era, the response of a president to news of the arrests would have been to condemn the plot and express solidarity with and support for the governor or whomever the target was. But Trump tweeted criticism of Whitmer for the same reasons the conspirators wanted to harm her: the Covid-19-related restrictions that she, like several other governors, had enacted. He sided with the literal enemy of the state and blamed its victim.

Of course, it should be noted that most Americans who own firearms are not members of a militia. But Trump's references to ""liberating"" states with strict Covid-19 restrictions and encouraging supporters to protect private property, watch polls and ""stand back and stand by"" are certainly creating a comfortable space for militia groups in society. This rhetoric emboldens and empowers those who believe — or are willing to be convinced — that immigrants are rapists, that Muslims are fanatics and that Joe Biden is going to put Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey in charge of the wholesale relocation of poor people of color into mostly white American suburbs.

LIBERATE MICHIGAN! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2020

During the protests that followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Aug. 23, Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, traveled to Kenosha from his home in the nearby Chicago suburb of Antioch, Illinois. There, he is alleged to have shot three people, killing two and wounding one. In an interview with the conservative media outlet The Daily Caller before the shootings, Rittenhouse explained why he was there: ""People are getting injured, and our job is to protect this business ... and part of my job is to also help people. If there is somebody hurt, I'm running into harm's way. That's why I have my rifle — because I can protect myself, obviously.""

It's unclear who the ""our"" is to whom Rittenhouse referred, but the implication is that he identified with others who had also assumed responsibility for the protection of public property during the protests, some of which turned violent. With Rittenhouse facing homicide charges, his attorney has described him as ""a Minuteman protecting his community when the government would not.""

Except that's not a thing. The Minutemen were a civilian militia that took part in the Revolutionary War and were made obsolete by the creation of the National Guard in the early 20th century. Since then, not only has there been no formalized role for armed civilians in American law enforcement, but it is also expressly illegal in every state, either by state constitution or statute, for civilians to arm and organize outside of a government body without express authority. In certain circumstances, the president can engage the National Guard or the military in civilian law enforcement duties, but never civilians.

The Minutemen may have been a reliable force back then, but today's militias tend to be far-right nationalist groups made up of people who distrust the federal government.

The Minutemen may have been a reliable force back then, but today's militias tend to be far-right nationalist groups made up of people who distrust the federal government. The number of militias in the country multiplied during Barack Obama's presidency, and they seem to have found more footing under Trump, for whom many militia members have developed an affinity. The federal government, which Trump trusts only insofar, it seems, as it helps him, agrees that armed gangs pose a major threat. Trump's own mantra of distrust of the federal government — particularly the so-called deep state — has the potential to dangerously embolden these groups.

In fairness, distrust of the government is something of a feature in America, and lots of Americans are armed. But these so-called militias blend these two features into a grievance with a potential solution, even if, as in the case of the alleged Michigan plot, the solution is entirely illegal. While they're not often violent, militias are, by definition, heavily armed, and while they exist in every state, they tend to proliferate in states with looser gun laws. According to experts who study these paramilitary groups, they are made up almost exclusively of white males, who hold exaggerated, almost cartoonish views of patriotism and liberty. Except that they're heavily armed, which makes the whole thing a lot less cartoonish.

And regardless of whether the self-appointed vigilantes in Michigan felt that their beef with Gov. Whitmer was valid (ostensibly that her orders were trampling on their civil liberties), there is no role whatsoever for civilians, armed or not, to assume law enforcement duties.

What is legal when it comes to defending oneself and bearing arms? In many states, civilians can engage in their own protection or the protection of others, but they can't band together to do so in an organized fashion. Private security firms can engage in the protection of people or property, but generally only under strict regulation by the state. So if you aren't a member of the National Guard or an employee of a security firm or you aren't protecting your own property or family, you have no business in America attempting to enforce laws.

In not taking a strong position against these paramilitary groups, Trump risks tacitly encouraging them. Trump has done little to create space between himself and the worst of these groups, starting with his now-infamous response to neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017: ""You had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.""

Changing course at this point in his presidency isn't likely for Trump, but the effect and impact of his approval of militias and their ideals will outlast this election, no matter who ends up winning. So we had better start getting our facts right."
Trump loves white men. These 'recovering Republicans' no longer love him back.,"['Liz Plank', 'An Msnbc Columnist', 'Award-Winning Journalist', 'Author', 'Was The Host Of', 'Positive Spin.', 'Her Book']","Purely based on voting behavior, it appears many white men love President Donald Trump.

In fact, love might be an understatement given that white men without college degrees voted for Trump at a rate higher than for any other candidate in the last 36 years. In 2016, when I reported from one of his rallies in Marshalltown, Iowa, men told me they would vote for him even if he shot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue. Today, they're risking their own lives on his behalf, braving potentially super-spreader events to line up for the chance to see him.

Maybe that's why, at his first rally since he tested positive for the coronavirus, the president offered to show his male fans affection first. ""I feel so powerful,"" the president shouted. ""I'll kiss everyone in that audience. I'll kiss the guys ... and the beautiful women."" I guess ""big fat kisses"" from a potentially contagious president work in the reverse order of lifeboats — it's the men who go first.

But with the election around the corner, some white men are starting to feel a little less loyal to the man who has promised them the moon and the stars. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed that Trump's lead among white male voters without college degrees has dropped from an enormous 35 points to a significant but narrowing 19 points. Every election cycle, we hear that white men can't be swayed, but what about the ones who can no longer justify staying in Trump's Republican Party?

Every election cycle, we hear that white men can't be swayed, but what about the ones who can no longer justify staying in Trump's Republican Party?

""Unfortunately, I'm voting for Joe Biden,"" Nick Stevens, 30, a Texas small-business owner, told me resolutely after he responded to a call-out I made on social media looking for conservative men having second thoughts about Trump. When we talked on the phone, Stevens said he wasn't leaving the party because he's particularly energized by Biden, but rather because he just can't bring himself to support a man like Trump. Stevens, who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, said Trump's performance of manhood has pushed him away from the GOP. ""He feeds off a particular view of masculinity that bullies people,"" Stevens said.

Other men described being embarrassed by Trump's interpretation of strength. ""He's made this party untenable,"" Nick Jesteadt, 30, a former conservative evangelist, told me over the phone. ""There is just no compassion. And these softer skills and personality traits that shouldn't be gender-based"" are now once again being tied to gender. Jesteadt described Trump's brash style of leadership, his repeated verbal abuse and his inability to listen as ""old classic masculinity"" and ""stuff you see from '60s dad sitcoms.""

Patrick Carr, who introduced himself as a ""recovering Republican,"" voiced a similar sentiment. ""Trump's version of masculinity would have everyone believe that his opinion is the only one that matters because he is president,"" he said. As it did for most of the men I spoke to, the president's treatment of women specifically touched a nerve. ""He openly lusted after his daughter and throws women away when they no longer please him,"" Carr said. While he's always voted Republican, this year he's voting for Biden and Kamala Harris.

A secondary theme also emerged in many of these conversations. While the men often described themselves as recovering Republicans, many spoke like recovering toxic masculinity addicts. What they despised about Trump was a machismo they once emulated. John Chapman, 36, a former Republican who interned for the Republican National Committee and spent a summer working for the Bush administration, told me Trump felt like a ""symptom of the toxic masculinity we all grew up idolizing."" He also said this model of masculinity has long been central to the Republican Party, dating to the days of Ronald Reagan.

""I was drinking the Kool-Aid so much that I named my dog Reagan,"" Chapman told me. But now that he has seen this model fail for him personally, he sees through it politically. ""My reaction to Trump's version of masculinity is just realizing how fragile he must be,"" he said. Stevens agrees. Trump's ""handling of Covid right now, to a T, describes me two years ago,"" he said. ""I had an issue for six years that I refused to go the doctor for, and it was almost fatal, because 'I was too tough for that.'""

And there's another element at play here: the men who identify with being bullied like Biden. Witnessing Biden be mocked as ""weak"" and humiliated for having a speech disability is just one more reason not to vote for Trump, Stevens said. Meanwhile, Biden's own expression of masculinity — he's not afraid to wear a mask or to campaign alongside an equally smart and successful wife — represents a more evolved gender identity that Stevens admires.

At this point, I know what you're probably thinking: Another piece trying to get inside the heads of white men? But while it's true that white men are still the most privileged class in our society, their progress has been relatively stagnant compared to that of other groups. Black women's incomes have more than doubled (as they should and must continue to do!), while the salaries of your average white men haven't. But this stagnation is a relevant point when it comes to their mindsets and, notably, voting patterns. In 2016, white men responded overwhelmingly to Trump's populist message. He said he would take care of them. He said he would make them feel like the providers and breadwinners society tells them to be.

But while Trump said he would take care of all white men, he has taken care of only some white men: the ultra-rich ones. As many have lost jobs and housing, Jeff Bezos has more than doubled his wealth since the beginning of the pandemic — a jump helped along by Trump's tax cuts. Your average white male voter isn't struggling because a woman or a person of color took his job; he is struggling because a select group of white men are hogging resources and paying taxes at a lower rate than the vast majority of Americans. Blaming immigrants for the stagnation many white men feel is a convenient distraction from the fact that it has been enabled by people like Trump himself.

Maybe that's why the president is so committed to the ""Macho Man"" bit.

Maybe that's why the president is so committed to the ""Macho Man"" bit, consistently playing the song at his rallies even as thousands of people continue to die. The president, who claims to be the ultimate man's man, has abysmally failed to both provide for and protect the American public. He's probably never going to stop playing the role of the male champion on TV. But at least some men are starting to see through the lie."

Conflicting comments from Trump and his advisers over recent days once again reveal the total chaos inside our national security system. And this is no time for major foreign policy decisions.

This sudden promise came as U.S. diplomats and military commanders were about to meet with Taliban leaders to press for follow-through on commitments to reduce violence and break with Al Qaeda. The reported response of one U.S. official when informed of the tweet was ""Oh my God!""

In what's become a pattern, Trump sabotaged his own policy. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to Doha, Qatar, in September to open talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government. The stance he was there to promote was clear when he said, referring to the Taliban, ""Our commitment to reduce forces to zero is conditioned on them executing their obligations under the agreement.""

Under Trump's leadership, the currency of an American handshake is in free fall.

Hours before Trump's tweet, White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien confirmed in a public forum that U.S. force levels would be maintained at around ""2,500 by early next year."" The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army Gen. Mark Milley, later contradicted both O'Brien and Trump, saying any discussion of further reduction in forces was pure speculation. Never before has a president so wantonly and consistently undermined his diplomats and military commanders engaged in difficult assignments on behalf of our country.

Bringing the Taliban and the Afghan government to the table in the first place had required a delicate balance. The Taliban had to be assured that U.S. force levels would be reduced, while the government had to be assured that U.S. force levels wouldn't go to zero without an intra-Afghan peace deal. No matter what one thinks of this process, and I have been highly skeptical, diplomacy can work here only if both parties recognize that the United States isn't heading for the exits regardless of what happens.

The withdrawal provisions in this Afghanistan agreement seem far more comprehensive than advertised. It’s a TOTAL withdrawal of ALL American and NATO forces within 14 months.

I experienced this policymaking chaos firsthand over two years working in the Trump administration, helping lead the global campaign against the Islamic State terrorist group. The veneer of a process below the president allowed for some success in coordinating with allies and prosecuting a military campaign across Iraq and Syria. In December 2018, together with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, I met with the military contributors to our coalition to secure their commitments to stay the course, particularly in Syria.

Our allies signed up because they trusted the U.S. and valued American leadership. Across two administrations, we had built a global coalition to coordinate and protect our citizens from a common threat with small deployments of U.S. forces. Less than two weeks after that meeting, however, Trump tweeted that he was withdrawing from Syria entirely.

....almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home. WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN. Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019

Our allies were baffled. Our adversaries were gleeful. Today in Syria, Russian flags fly over what had been U.S. positions. Russian forces regularly harass U.S. troops — while Trump says nothing in their defense.

Diplomacy and national security decision-making demand thought, prudence and rigorous process, a formula that no administration gets entirely right. The world is too complex, our adversaries are too adaptive and information is too limited to make the right decisions in every instance. That's why most presidents take the national security aspect of their job with the utmost seriousness, consulting regularly with advisers and intelligence professionals.

Donald Trump does none of this. He reportedly doesn't read — let alone absorb — intelligence reporting. He's consistently blown astray by something seen on television or said by a foreign leader on the phone, reversing policy wholesale with no thought as to consequences.

Syria and Afghanistan are high-profile cases, but this chaos and incoherence have corroded American authority and influence across the globe. Our diplomats in foreign capitals can't articulate American policy to foreign counterparts because there is no policy. On any given issue, our allies, adversaries and competitors know everything can change with a spasmodic tweet. Under Trump's leadership, the currency of an American handshake is in free fall.

Consider the American military facilities in Germany that have served as a cornerstone to peace for over 70 years. They remain vital to readiness across Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Trump, with no process or planning, ordered one-third of our forces there, about 12,000 troops, to pack up and leave. When his defense secretary, Mark Esper, held a news conference to suggest that the move had some strategic rationale, Trump undercut him moments later, saying he had ordered the move solely because ""Germany is delinquent"" and not paying its bills — a charge he's levied at NATO allies for years, never pausing to understand how NATO's defense spending pledge actually works. Nobody consulted Berlin, where senior officials expressed astonishment, saying Trump's behavior was ""completely unacceptable.""

Germany pays Russia billions of dollars a year for Energy, and we are supposed to protect Germany from Russia. What’s that all about? Also, Germany is very delinquent in their 2% fee to NATO. We are therefore moving some troops out of Germany! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2020

The process of foreign policymaking and diplomacy isn't glamorous. It requires constant and ongoing consultation and a president who is informed, knowledgeable and interested. Those doing the work must have some confidence that they won't be undercut on a whim. Counterparts across the table — whether friendly or adversarial — must know the same. I've sat across from Russian officials across two administrations. In one, I knew the president had my back. In another, I knew a call from Putin might undermine everything we were working to achieve.

The reckless and chaotic nature of foreign policy in the Trump administration cedes advantage entirely to more disciplined and patient adversaries. Returning to first principles — discipline, prudence and process — will be essential as we work as a country to restore our respect in the world and rebuild the confidence of our friends."
Russian hackers target hospitals in a deadly new trend. The White House isn't helping.,"['Mieke Eoyang Is The Senior Vice President Of The National Security Program At Third Way', 'A Washington', 'D.C. Think Tank. She Had Previously Served As A Congressional Staffer On The House Permanent Select Committee On Intelligence', 'The House Armed Services Committee', 'As The Defense Policy Advisor To Sen. Edward M. Kennedy. She Is An Msnbc National Security Contributor.']","This week, more than 43,000 Americans have been hospitalized for Covid-19. In intensive care units across the country, patients are separated from their families and loved ones, some waiting in the hush punctuated by the beeping of monitors. But many are oblivious to another threat looming over them: a cluster of attacks from hackers, some allegedly Russian, targeting the hospitals fighting to save their lives.

In 2020, ransomware has become an increasingly prevalent threat as we see more cities, hospitals, and companies shut out of their operations.

The FBI has announced that hackers are attempting to break into hospitals’ systems using a botnet known as Trickbot in order to insert a malware called Ryuk to encrypt and hold hospital data hostage until a ransom is paid. The alleged Russian hackers had reportedly been circulating a list of 400 American hospitals they planned to target.

In 2020, ransomware has become an increasingly prevalent threat as we see more cities, hospitals and companies shut out of their operations. The victims of corporate or civic ransomware face a terrible choice: pay the ransomer’s demands or engage in the expensive, time-consuming and potentially futile effort to rebuild entire operations.

The U.S. government has struggled to figure out how to stop these hackers. Understandably, the government encourages victims to report these incidents and tries to dissuade them from paying ransoms so that the crime is no longer profitable. The U.S. military has been working to disrupt hackers’ cybertools, as has the private sector. These efforts have been effective at taking some attackers offline temporarily. But unfortunately, the government’s efforts have at best been temporary disruptions, and at worst made things far worse for the victims. This has been especially true for the latest wave of hospital attacks.

For hospital administrators responding to these ransomware attacks, accessing medical data is literally a life-or-death matter. Doctors may not be able to access patient medical histories or admit new patients. Ambulances may be diverted to other hospitals, increasing the time it takes patients to get access to life-saving care. Surgeries and other procedures may be delayed at cost to patients’ health. There are many reasons why a hospital might decide that the quickest, most effective way to get up and running is to pay the ransom. For many, when it comes down to saving a life or cooperating with the government, paying a ransomware is the responsible choice.

And amid the difficult decision of whether to pay the ransomer, a hospital under attack must contend with a further complication. On Oct. 1, the Treasury Department issued an advisory that if a victim pays a ransom and the perpetrator turns out to be from a sanctioned country like North Korea, Iran or Russia, the victim may be liable for violating U.S. sanctions law. The department does allow a victim to apply for a license to make said payment at the Office of Foreign Asset Control. But for a hospital administrator wrestling with the urgent question of whether to pay a ransom, applying and waiting for an OFAC license is an untenable bureaucratic delay when lives hang in the balance.

It’s not enough to disrupt the attacker’s systems or shame victims out of paying to get their data back. In order to permanently disrupt these ransomware attacks, you have to get to the people behind the attacks either by arresting them or convincing them to stop. Law enforcement and cybersecurity analysts point out that these attackers are often in countries like Russia, where Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government is uninterested in turning them over for prosecution and, in some cases, actively fights against the extradition of cybercriminals.

Still, indictments are a powerful tool, even if another country is harboring the cybercriminal. Issuing an indictment makes clear that the U.S. is holding the individual behind the illegal acts accountable. By seeking an arrest and presenting a request for extradition, the U.S. would make clear that targeting hospitals is a violation of international norms, akin to the targeting of hospitals in wartime. A refusal by a country like Russia to honor such a request would make clear that they are willing to harbor those who would kill innocent people for greed. If nothing else, indictments could at least help apply international pressure on a foreign government.

Issuing an indictment makes clear that the U.S. is holding the individual behind the illegal acts accountable.

During the previous administration, President Barack Obama expressed his displeasure at Chinese hackers who target the intellectual property of U.S. companies by directly speaking with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two governments reached an agreement, after which we saw a marked decline in Chinese hacking.

Unfortunately, President Donald Trump has demonstrated his refusal to believe that the Russians are behind any hacks. And worse, he has refused to confront Putin over reports that the Russians were paying the Taliban bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan. If Trump won’t stand up to Putin for the lives of American troops in the field, there’s little chance that he would confront Putin over targeting vulnerable patients in American hospitals."

The process was long and tedious — forms, fees, photos, biometrics and, as the final step, a naturalization interview. That last hurdle in particular showed how much the rhetoric about the democracy the U.S. shares with immigrants differs from how it’s practiced.

One of the reasons I was keen to become a citizen is because the United States is supposed to be based not on a race or a culture but on an idea: of popular sovereignty; of government of, by, and for the people; of democracy.

One of the reasons I was keen to become a citizen is because the United States is supposed to be based not on a race or a culture but on an idea: of popular sovereignty; of government of, by and for the people; of democracy. That was reflected in my naturalization interview, as I discussed on my show the next day, which involved a test of my knowledge of “civics,” of U.S. history and government. Every prospective citizen is expected to answer a minimum of six questions correctly, from a list of 100 provided in a booklet from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Democracy is something of a running theme throughout the test. The opening section of the question booklet is titled “Principles of American Democracy.” Many of the questions refer to elections and the electoral process; question 55 asks: “What are two ways that Americans can participate in their democracy?”

Now that I’m done with the test, maybe I should mail my well-thumbed USCIS booklet to the office of Republican Sen. Mike Lee. The senior senator from Utah declared on Twitter the night before my citizenship test:

We’re not a democracy. — Mike Lee (@SenMikeLee) October 8, 2020

He followed up a few hours later:

Democracy isn’t the objective; liberty, peace, and prospefity are. We want the human condition to flourish. Rank democracy can thwart that. — Mike Lee (@SenMikeLee) October 8, 2020

Sorry — what? Sure, right-wing trolls on Twitter often invoke the “we’re a republic, not a democracy” talking point to try to deflect from calls for greater representation and political equality. But it is deeply depressing to witness a sitting U.S. senator engage in the same “cheap rhetorical sleight of hand,” to quote the political scientist Ed Burmila.

I suggest you read this and understand why what you said is such a dumb statement. https://t.co/JF204lI0HK — Joe Belian (@msuvagabond) October 8, 2020

Of course, Lee doesn’t really believe the U.S. isn’t a democracy. “It’s time to stop delaying democracy; it’s time to stop hiding from the American people,” he declaimed on the Senate floor in 2015. Lee, as writer Jonathan Katz noted, was accusing Democrats of undermining the democratic process in a debate over funding for the Department of Homeland Security.

We shouldn’t be surprised by Lee’s entreaties though. In all three branches of federal government, minority rule is the new normal — so why should Republicans pretend to care about democracy and the popular support it requires? Why would they want to promote it?

None of the founders would have recognized a system that regularly denies a majority of voting citizens both political representation and the power to pass laws.

President Donald Trump lost the popular vote in 2016. The previous Republican president, George W. Bush, came to office in 2000 after also losing the popular vote. At the presidential level, the GOP has won the popular vote only once since 1988. Yet they have controlled the White House for the majority of the 21st century. According to Cook Political Report’s David Wasserman, “In 2020, it's possible Trump could win 5 million fewer votes than his opponent — and still win a second term.”

In Congress, the House of Representatives is far from representative thanks to partisan gerrymandering. In the wake of 2018’s blue wave, which saw Democrats retake control of the House, the overall result still “wasn’t as bad as it could have been for Republicans,” according to analysis by The Associated Press, which states that the GOP “won about 16 more U.S. House seats than would have been expected based on their average share of the vote in congressional districts across the country.”

Across the Capitol, the Senate has always been an anti-majoritarian institution but never more so than today. Based as it is on states regardless of size, “the Republican Senate ‘majority,’” according to Vox’s Ian Millhiser, currently “represents 15 million fewer people than the Democratic ‘minority.’”

And on Oct. 12, the Senate Judiciary Committee launched hearings to confirm Amy Coney Barrett, Trump’s third Supreme Court nominee. If confirmed, Barrett will join Chief Justice John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorusch, and Brett Kavanaugh in being nominated by a president who became president despite losing the popular vote. A minority of voters will have led to a majority on the highest court in the land in lifetime posts.

The problem remains the same at the state level. In five states in 2017 and 2018 — Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin — “Democratic candidates for state house received a majority of the statewide popular vote,” according to a study by the USC Schwarzenegger Institute, but “the Republican Party won more seats than Democrats,” thereby retaining their majorities. In Wisconsin, Republicans won 45 percent of the vote but gained a whopping 65 percent of the seats in the state Legislature.

How is this fair? How is it small-d democratic or, for that matter, small-r republican? To those who abuse history to defend such grossly inequitable outcomes with the tired trope of “We’re a republic, not a democracy,” it is worth considering the definition of a “republic” offered by Founding Father James Madison. In Federalist No. 10, Madison defined a republic as “the delegation of the government…to a small number of citizens elected by the rest.” The “rest,” however, have since become perpetually stymied even as their overall numbers have grown through universal suffrage. Yes, the U.S. political and judicial systems were designed to protect the minority from the majority — but not to entrench minority rule across the United States. None of the founders would have recognized a system that regularly denies a majority of voting citizens both political representation and the power to pass laws.

Those of us who are new U.S. citizens understand this, perhaps, better than most. I’m reminded of the third question in my test booklet: “The idea of self-government is in the first three words of the Constitution. What are these words?”

Answer: “We the People.”

“A Minority of People” would be marked incorrect."
"Biden widens margin in Georgia, Pennsylvania as final votes tabulated","['Lauren Egan', 'Lauren Egan Is A Reporter For Nbc News Based In Washington.']","WASHINGTON — Joe Biden's vote margin over President Donald Trump continued on Saturday to widen in several key battleground states, where the final votes were being tabulated.

While no winner has been projected, Biden entered Saturday with higher vote totals in four key states — Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania. But all four remained rated by NBC News Decision Desk as too close to call.

A call in both Nevada and Arizona in Biden's favor would put him right at the 270 electoral votes needed to win, while a victory in Pennsylvania alone would give him 273 electoral votes.

As Americans watched as the vote count entered the fourth day, Democrats have tried to project optimism.

“We don’t have a final declaration, a victory yet. But the numbers tell us a clear and convincing story,” Biden said in a brief speech Friday night. “We’re going to win this race.”

Trump and his campaign are vowing to fight even if Biden is declared the winner, looking to launch a multi-front legal battle to overturn votes they claim should not be tallied. The campaign has failed to provide any evidence of the wide-scale voter fraud they claim is running rampant in places like Philadelphia.

""Joe Biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the President,"" Trump tweeted on Friday night. ""I could make that claim also. Legal proceedings are just now beginning!""

Trump has repeatedly and erroneously declared victory, including in states where Biden is the projected winner. The president has also repeated unfounded conspiracy theories and tried to cast doubt on the integrity of the tabulation process.

In Pennsylvania, Biden is leading by over 28,00 votes, 3,336,887 votes (49.6 percent) to Trump's 3,308,054 (49.1 percent), with 96 percent of the expected vote in. Many of the remaining ballots come from Democratic-leaning areas.

Allegheny County, home to Pittsburgh, will resume counting ballots Saturday morning, and the state is expected to continue to slowly report new numbers throughout the day.

In Nevada, Biden leads by just over 22,000 votes, 632,558 votes (49.8 percent) to Trump's 609,901 votes (48 percent), with 93 percent of the expected vote in.

In Arizona, Biden is up about 30,000 votes, 1,604,067 (49.9 percent) to Trump's 1,574,206 (48.7 percent), with 97 percent of the expected vote in.

Georgia appears headed for a recount with Biden leading narrowly by about 7,200 votes, 2,461,455 (49.4 percent) to Trump's 2,454,207 (49.3 percent).

Georgia state officials said they anticipate the closeness of the race will result in a recount."
'My ideals are driven by my faith': Raphael Warnock on his Senate runoff race,['Curtis Bunn'],"From the pulpit of one of the most storied churches in America, the Rev. Raphael Warnock has blended his fiery sermons of faith and love with urgent social messages of fairness and democracy for the last 15 years.

Many members of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta — the church of Martin Luther King Jr. — wondered from early on, whether Warnock, the church’s senior pastor, had political aspirations.

He confirmed those long-standing impressions by running for Senate in Georgia, and finds himself one runoff victory away from taking his influential voice to Washington, D.C.

“I have been preaching in this campaign the same message I have been preaching for years,” Warnock, 51, told NBC News. “I’ve been trying to point us toward the highest ideals in our humanity and in the covenant we have with one another as American people — that all of us deserve an opportunity to create a prosperous life for us and our families.”

As of Friday afternoon, Warnock received 32.9 percent of the vote, outdistancing his closest foe, Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler, who garnered 26 percent of the ballots. Because Georgia requires a runoff if a candidate does not receive 50 percent of the vote, Warnock and Loeffler will go head to head Jan. 5, 2021. Republican David Perdue and Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff also will have a runoff that day for Georgia’s other Senate seat.

These battles may affect the balance of power in the U.S. Senate, creating a 50-50 split if the Democrats win both seats. If that happens and Sen. Kamala Harris becomes vice president, she would be the decisive vote.

Undoubtedly, Warnock’s will be a heated race, fundraising efforts could bring in millions from supporters throughout Georgia and across the country. Warnock did not waste any time; he held a virtual fundraiser Thursday night.

“What Rev. Warnock provides is a commitment to fairness that is unwavering,” Ebenezer member Cecilia Baker of Atlanta said this week. “His messages on Sunday are uplifting and almost always educational about the political landscape and how it impacts Black people. He fights for his community from the pulpit and will do the same in Washington.”

Warnock said there is no separation of church and state in his principles.

“My ideals are driven by my faith and what has caused me to fight for access to affordable health care, the dignity of work and voting rights,” he said. “I think your vote is your voice and your voice is human dignity. And we’ve got to make sure everyone has a voice in our democracy.

Former President Barack Obama voiced his support for Warnock in the run-up to the election. “You don’t find a lot of people in Washington like Rev. Warnock,” he said in an October campaign ad for Warnock. “And that’s exactly why we’ve got to get him in office.”

Warnock’s stature as a dynamic preacher at an historic church also helped cement his political stature. He and 10 others were arrested in 2014 at the Georgia Capitol when the state refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

He consistently voices his concern over voting rights and people earning a living wage. “We must pay essential workers essential pay,” he said.

“I look forward to getting to the U.S. Senate so I can help pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act,” Warnock added. “I’ve always tried to leverage the moral truth to create moral good. My whole life has been about service. And that doesn’t end at the church door, it starts there.”

He contrasts his work and life to Loeffler’s and considers the choice obvious. Loeffler, a businesswoman, was appointed in December 2019 by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp to replace Sen. Johnny Isakson, who resigned for health reasons.

Loeffler co-owns the Atlanta Dream of the WNBA, a league made up of 67 percent Black women. She openly opposed the Black Lives Matter movement and rejected the idea of slogans supporting the movement on her players’ uniforms or painted on arena floors.

The players called for her ousting as owner. “It’s ironic for her to make these statements and for her to still want to be associated with the team,” Dream player Elizabeth Williams said of Loeffler on NPR’s Morning Edition in July.

Warnock also criticized her record in the Senate.

“My opponent has been in the Senate since January,” he said. “We’ve learned that she knew a few weeks after joining the Senate about the pandemic — which has caused stress and death across the country and Georgia — and she did a good job of protecting her portfolio.”

Earlier this year, it was reported that before the Covid-19 pandemic sharply affected the economy, Loeffler was one of at least four senators who made millions of dollars worth of seemingly opportune stock trades. She had since said she and her husband would divest from individual stocks. An investigation by the Department of Justice over the matter was later dropped.

“The people of Georgia are still waiting for her to do something for them,” Warnock added. “So, the choice could not be more stark. Georgia has to decide if it wants a senator who was selected or one who is elected by the people.”

"Trump's election falsehoods 'put a smile' on the faces of dictators, observers warn","['Alexander Smith', 'Alexander Smith Is A Senior Reporter For Nbc News Digital Based In London.']","LONDON — Accusations of vote-rigging, protests at counting centers and false declarations of victory from an embattled incumbent. President Donald Trump's baseless claims in the wake of the election are a gift to the world's dictators and undermine American efforts to call out antidemocratic behavior abroad, experts have warned.

Since the election, Trump has launched a rhetorical assault on the basic tenets of American democracy. He urged officials to stop counting votes when his lead in several battleground states began to narrow; he alleged widespread voter fraud without evidence and wrongly labeled mail-in ballots illegal; and he repeatedly accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" the election.

Even after a first term in which the president has repeatedly undermined democratic values, his comments this week have caused a whole new level of alarm. This only increased when his supporters, some of them armed, began crowding polling centers during knife-edge counts in Arizona and Michigan.

But independent observers have also warned of damaging consequences abroad, where the United States has spent decades — and millions of dollars — on democracy building efforts.

""He very clearly crossed a line by saying votes should stop being counted,"" said Michael Link, the leader of an electoral observer mission to the U.S. by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. ""To use a sports analogy, when you're in the middle of the game and you're leading with 40 minutes to go, you can't stop the game just because you want to win.""

The OSCE, a large international organization that monitors elections around the world, found in its preliminary report Wednesday that the U.S. vote was largely ""competitive and well managed."" But it said it had been ""tarnished"" by Trump's ""baseless allegations"" and warned his comments would ""harm public trust in democratic institutions"" globally.

Watching from Malawi, authoritarianism expert Nic Cheeseman said he was already witnessing first hand the real-world damage wrought by Trump's remarks.

""This weakens the moral authority of the U.S. when speaking out about other countries' elections, and that will embolden dictators around the world,"" said Cheeseman, who is temporarily based in East Africa but is a professor of democracy and international development at England's University of Birmingham.

Anyone wanting to subvert democracy in their own countries will now be able to ""take advantage of the fact the U.S. now has a weaker voice on these issues,"" he said.

The past four years have seen strongmen — from Syria to Turkey, and Hungary to Thailand — adopt Trump's ""fake news"" mantra to dismiss factual journalism that they don't like. The fear now is that autocrats will be able to directly reference Trump's antidemocratic rhetoric to justify their own actions. Or they may just feel that the U.S. is more likely to let them off the hook, Cheeseman said.

""The U.S. is the leading democracy in the world,"" former British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the BBC on Wednesday.

""If we have people talking about stolen elections left right and center, then we are only going to put a smile on the face of people like President Putin, President Xi,"" Hunt said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, ""who will look at their own people and say: Aren't you pleased you haven't got any of this mess?""

Even after a presidency in which Trump has shocked the world with his norm-busting style, for many observers at home and abroad his comments have found a new nadir.

""People here are looking at America in disbelief,"" Cheeseman said. ""America is becoming an electoral laughing stock around the world, and the long-term damage to America's democratic reputation will be profound and last long beyond Trump.""

Former Vice President Joe Biden has predicted victory, and called for unity as the final vote was counted. According to NBC News, he has received 253 Electoral College votes, compared to 214 for Trump. His election lawyer Bob Bauer, did receive some criticism for saying that ""we've won the election, and we're going to defend that election"" in response to Trump's remarks.

For decades, the U.S. has been on the forefront of international democracy-building efforts, being quick to call out some foreign governments when they challenge democratic norms.

In 2018, the United States Agency for International Development spent $92 million on its Transition Initiatives program, designed to help countries boost efforts toward ""sustainable development, peace, good governance, and democracy.""

Ahead of a spate of elections across Africa, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned last month that the U.S. would ""watch closely the actions of individuals who interfere in the democratic process and will not hesitate to consider consequences.""

And on Wednesday, the morning after the U.S. election, the U.S. Embassy in the Ivory Coast called on the country's leaders to show ""commitment to the democratic process"" after its election was disputed.

""After what Trump said, that exact language could be very easily boomeranged right back to the United States because it applies here, too,"" according to Brian Klaas, an associate professor of global policy at University College London.

Of course, the U.S. is also accused of soft-soft-pedaling criticism when it comes to friends and strategic partners. Washington counts among its allies the human rights-abusing theocracy of Saudi Arabia. And it gives $1.3 billion in military aid to Egypt, where watchdogs say President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has consolidated his authoritarian rule.

During his time in office Trump has cozied up to dictators, notably saying he ""fell in love"" with North Korea's Kim Jong Un, widely regarded as one of the world's worst living human rights abusers.

In this sense, many experts see the president's post-election comments as the most brazen example of a long-running trend, rather than an entirely new development.

During his previous work as an election observer traveling around the world, Klaas said he encountered pushback following the 2000 U.S. presidential race, in which George W. Bush defeated Al Gore despite losing the popular vote and only after an ugly legal battle in Florida that reached the Supreme Court.

""People would say to me, 'How can you lecture us when you don't even give the presidency to the person who gets the most votes?'"" he said. ""This election is like Bush v Gore on steroids.""

There are some senior Republicans who have broken rank with Trump, condemning the comments and insisting all votes must be counted.

""There is no defense for the president's comments tonight undermining our Democratic process,"" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said in a tweet. ""America is counting the votes, and we must respect the results as we always have before. No election or person is more important than our democracy.""

However, these nuances tend to receive little cut-through outside the U.S., and are ""probably getting lost in the wall of noise when it comes to international perceptions,"" Cheeseman said.

And Trump's antidemocratic message is the one that has reverberated above all others.

In Bangkok, Thailand, where protesters risk jail for demanding democratic reform,student Pan Siripark, 19, said they were something that ""no one would have ever expected from the U.S.""

It was ""reminiscent of third-world countries,"" he added, ""where you have accusations of vote rigging … it seems unbelievable."""

But it wasn’t flown in his middle school, which only raised the American flag. Ethan thought the state flag, which included the Confederate emblem in the upper left corner, was just one “white people had when they didn’t like Black people.”

It wasn’t until late October, as the state prepared to vote on a new flag, that he learned the Confederate symbol had officially represented Mississippi for decades.

“He was taken aback,” said LaShunna McInnis, principal of Powell Middle School, who discussed the flag with Ethan. “I could see it in his face.”

McInnis had called Ethan to ask if he would participate in a ceremony that would take place at the school if voters chose the new flag.

In the years before the vote, the state flag had gradually disappeared from public schools in Mississippi’s capital. Several districts in the Mississippi Delta, too, and in other pockets of the state took down the flag with its Civil War iconography, electing to fly only the American flag.

Most of these districts were nearly all-Black and Black-led. On these campuses, leaders resisted, or at least never prioritized, displaying a symbol that has long been viewed as racist by many in the nation’s Blackest state even though Mississippi law required public schools to fly it.

Now, after Mississippi voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to replace the flag’s Confederate imagery with one featuring the state’s official flower, a magnolia, and the phrase “In God We Trust,” schools that balked at flying the state flag are now planning to hoist it for the first time in recent history.

McInnis, who is Black, watched “The Dukes of Hazzard” growing up. As a child, she didn’t think much about the rebel flag on top of “General Lee,” a car featured prominently on the show named after Gen. Robert E. Lee, the Confederate army leader. But as a principal of a school where almost all the students are Black and some live with grandparents or older relatives who lived through the Jim Crow South, or whose parents did, she thought differently.

“Having that flag flying above definitely would have been a source of tension,” she said.

Frank Figgers, vice chair of the Veterans of the Mississippi Civil Rights Movement, says some school districts likely removed the state’s flag after the passage of the 1965 Civil Rights Voting Act. Black voting power helped to diversify elected school boards that then quietly had the flags taken down. Other schools, he said, likely never displayed the banner even during segregation.

Growing up in 1960s Mississippi, Cheryl Turner couldn’t escape the symbol once carried into battle by Confederate soldiers. The image was always looming. On walks home from school when Turner and her siblings would look for pecans on the grounds of the state Capitol in Jackson, the state flag was waving in the background.

The shadow of the Confederacy was also cast over her elementary school, which had recently begun integrating when she started fifth grade there in 1966.

At the time, the campus was named for Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy. She was spared from the mobs that had attacked Black children integrating schools in the north Mississippi town of Grenada that same year, but she still has hurtful memories. A white teacher questioned whether Turner and other Black students would be able to keep pace with their lessons.

She’s not sure if the state flag flew at her elementary school. But in college, she couldn’t miss it.

At the University of Mississippi, crowds waved the rebel flag like pompoms inside Vaught-Hemingway Stadium so much that she didn’t feel comfortable attending football games to watch a home team nicknamed the Rebels.

“Being a student there was the first time I really felt the angst of the flag,” she said.

The defiance of some public schools in deciding to ignore state law and not fly the flag ignited a failed attempt in the state Legislature in 2015 to potentially strip accreditation from such districts. A white state representative told reporters that the legislation was prompted by the flag’s absence from schools, The Clarion Ledger reported. The measure passed in the House Education Committee, but failed to become law. In 2016, a woman sued a north Mississippi school district in an attempt to force officials to fly the flag.

The Legislature’s turnaround from potentially punishing districts for not flying the flag to replacing it happened amid widespread demonstrations across the nation against racial injustice this summer.

In June, thousands marched in downtown Jackson in one of the largest protests in the state in decades. A new state flag was among the demands.

In July, Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, signed legislation to replace the state flag. The law required that the new design be approved by voters with a mandate that it included the phrase, “In God We Trust” and excluded the Confederate battle emblem.

On Wednesday, a day after Mississippi voters approved the new design, Ethan and McInnis attended two small flag-raising ceremonies at Powell Middle School and at the district’s downtown office.

Ethan’s grandfather attended and several generations watched as a junior ROTC unit from Forest High School pulled the flag up the pole. There was a reverent silence as the banner waved in the wind.

The new flag flew for only one day at Powell, as school officials wait until January for the Legislature to officially ratify it. Because of the pandemic, Jackson students won’t return to in-person classes before the end of this year. Ethan hopes that when schools physically reopen the new flag will be there to greet them.

“It’s always important to learn about past history to build up your future,” Ethan said. “It did represent our state once.” He wants his classmates and the next generation to know “the steps it took to change the state flag.”

Turner is grateful young Mississippians won’t grow up in the shadow of the Old South like she did.

In 2017, students, parents and educators voted to rename Jefferson Davis Elementary, her alma mater, named after the Confederate president, to the Barack Obama Magnet School, in honor of the nation’s first Black president.

Now, Turner has a sign emblazoned with the new state flag in her front yard. She’s thankful that her 7-year-old granddaughter, Kaylen, and her young grandson, Ian, won’t be confronted with relics of the South’s worst transgressions. The flagpole outside their school won’t fly a Civil War symbol. Her school’s name won’t honor the Confederacy.

“In just a little while no one will know this school was named Jefferson Davis,” she reflected. “They’ll just know it was Barack Obama. That’s all she knows. It’s great they won’t have that connection to a Confederate relic.”"
"Alex Cora, tainted by Houston Astros sign-stealing scandal, rehired by Boston Red Sox","['David K. Li', 'David K. Li Is A Breaking News Reporter For Nbc News.']","The Boston Red Sox rehired former manager Alex Cora nine months after parting ways with him over his involvement in the Houston Astros sign-stealing scandal.

Cora led Boston to the World Series title in 2018, when the Red Sox beat the Los Angeles Dodgers.

In making the announcement on Twitter, the Red Sox posted a picture of Cora lifting the Commissioner's Trophy with the words, ""Welcome back, Alex Cora.""

""I am grateful for the opportunity to manage once again and return to the game I have loved my entire life,” Cora said in a statement released by the team.

""I am eager to get back to work with our front office, coaches and especially our players. Boston is where I have always wanted to be, and I could not be more excited to help the Red Sox achieve our ultimate goal of winning in October.""

A few words from AC: pic.twitter.com/GSQBuD8OYT — Red Sox (@RedSox) November 6, 2020

Before arriving in Boston in his first stint as manager, Cora had been a well-liked bench coach with the Astros in 2017 when that team won it all, in a title that's now being called into question.

Houston was caught monitoring the opposing catchers' signals using a camera in center field of the team's stadium, Minute Maid Park, and then relaying that information to Astros hitters - often via someone banging on a trash can.

By knowing the upcoming pitch type, batters could adjust their timing. For instance, batters would know to swing early if a fastball was coming — or sit back and judge the location for a breaking ball or changeup.

The Red Sox were caught in similar acts in 2018, though MLB insisted that Boston's cheating ""was far more limited in scope and impact"" than the 2017 Houston Astros.

Boston was stripped of one draft choice for its 2018 misdeeds, and Cora stepped down in January.

Cora's rehiring comes a week after another key figure in the Astros scandal, then-manager AJ Hinch, also resurfaced. Hinch, who along with Astros General Manager Jeff Luhnow were fired when the scandal came to light, was hired last week as manager of the Detroit Tigers."
"White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Trump aide test positive for Covid-19","['Dartunorro Clark', 'Dartunorro Clark Is A Political Reporter For Nbc News.', 'Monica Alba', 'Monica Alba Is A Political Reporter For Nbc News.', 'Hallie Jackson', 'Hallie Jackson Is The Chief White House Correspondent For Nbc News.']","White House chief of staff Mark Meadows tested positive for Covid-19, a source familiar with the diagnosis told NBC News on Friday.

The news, first reported by Bloomberg, comes as the U.S. recorded the third straight day of more than 100,000 new coronavirus cases, breaking previous records.

It also comes as President Donald Trump and some of his allies are mounting election-related lawsuits and making baseless claims of voter fraud to fight off the prospect of a Joe Biden presidency.

It is not immediately clear when Meadows tested positive.

Trump named Meadows his new chief of staff in March. Meadows, 61, a former North Carolina congressman and onetime leader of the House Freedom Caucus, is a longtime Trump loyalist.

Meadows was among those in attendance Wednesday morning hours after the polls closed for an election night party at the White House, where Trump falsely claimed that he had won the presidential election as millions of votes had yet to be counted and several battleground states were not called.

Many attendees, such as Fox News personalities and White House aides, were seen not wearing masks as they ate and mingled before the president’s speech.

Nick Trainer, a Trump campaign aide, also tested positive, bringing the total of people inside the president's orbit known to have contracted Covid-19 to 35.

Trainer is the director of battleground strategy for Trump's re-election effort. It’s unclear when he contracted the virus and when he was last at campaign headquarters in Virginia.

The Trump campaign declined to comment.

Prior to these cases, 28 administration officials, campaign officials and close contacts tested positive for the virus during a late-September and early October outbreak in the White House. Among those cases, at least 14 were people who attended the Sept. 26 Rose Garden event for Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

Trump and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for Covid-19 after White House aide Hope Hicks was diagnosed last month, among other high-profile Republicans in the White House, Congress and the Trump campaign. Many, including the president, have since recovered."
"Biden predicts win, calls for unity, as presidential race still too close to call","['Adam Edelman', 'Adam Edelman Is A Political Reporter For Nbc News.']","WILMINGTON, Del. — Joe Biden on Friday night once again predicted victory in the 2020 race, calling for unity after the final results come in and claiming that the vote that had so far been counted proved that the nation had given him a “mandate for action” on issues like combatting the pandemic.

“We don’t have a final declaration, a victory yet. But the numbers tell us a clear and convincing story,” Biden said in a brief speech from his campaign headquarters. “We’re going to win this race.”

According to NBC News, Biden has received 253 Electoral College votes, compared to 214 for President Donald Trump. The battleground states of Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and North Carolina remain too close to call, according to NBC News.

Citing the fact that he’d already received more than 74.3 million votes — the most ever by any presidential candidate — Biden said he was “going to win this race with a clear majority, with the nation behind us.”

“What’s becoming clear each hour is that record numbers of Americans of all races, faiths, religions chose change over more of the same,” he said, adding that the numbers suggested voters had “given us a mandate for action” on policy issues including controlling Covid, climate change, the economy and fighting systemic racism.

He spoke of his desire to unite a divided country, urged Americans eagerly awaiting a clear result in the race to “remain calm and patient and let the process work out” and promised that all votes would be counted.

""My responsibility as president will be the represent the whole nation. And I want you to know that I'll work as hard for those who voted against me as those who voted for me. That's the job,"" he said. ""It's called the duty of care for all Americans.""

Those comments, in particular, marked a stark contrast with the statements made and actions taken in recent days by Trump.

In the days since the election, Trump has generated unfounded fears about the vote tabulation process, by firing off tweets demanding that officials halt counting and leave ballots uncounted in places where analysts think the remaining votes favor Democrats.

In the early hours Wednesday morning, with millions of votes still uncounted, Trump falsely claimed he had won. And on Thursday, he held a press conference where he made a series of false election fraud claims.

Biden, meanwhile, also pointed to the fact that he and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., received briefings on Thursday on the coronavirus pandemic and the economy as proof that they were “not waiting to get the work done, to start the process” of transitioning to the presidency."
Some voters in swing states worry about status of their absentee ballots,"['Rima Abdelkader', 'Rima Abdelkader Is A Senior Reporter For Social Newsgathering At Nbc News In New York.', 'Suzanne Ciechalski', ""Suzanne Ciechalski Is A New York-Based Reporter For Nbc News' Social Newsgathering Team Specializing In Verification"", 'Social Discovery.']","Georgia resident Margo Moorer has been voting in U.S. elections for almost 51 years without any problems. So when she got a call Thursday about her absentee ballot being rejected over a signature issue, she was shocked.

“I just kind of got real quiet because I’m trying to think, ‘How did that happen?’” Moorer, 67, said.

Moorer said she typically votes in person, but opted for an absentee ballot this year and has had to troubleshoot an issue. Her ballot is in the “curing” process — which happens when there’s a missing signature, a signature that doesn't match what's on file or another problem.

She's among a number of voters in battleground states Georgia and Pennsylvania who said they are worried their votes won’t be counted.

“It’s time for us to change,” Moorer said.

“That’s why it’s important that these votes have been cured, that they are counted. And everybody knows somebody somewhere that's out there actually working in counting and doing what’s right,"" she said.

Georgia’s deadline to cure ballots was 5 p.m. Friday.

Joyce Lanterman, who lives in Georgia’s DeKalb County, said she dropped off her absentee ballot in October and only learned that her ballot’s status was “challenged” for an invalid signature when she checked online November 4.

“Nobody called me,” Lanterman, 48, said. “I keep seeing indications that I was supposed to get a call or something, but I never got any kind of notification. I would not have known if I had not gone to check.”

She said the Georgia Democratic Voter Protection hotline helped her get a ballot cure affidavit form. Despite reassurance from the group that her vote would be counted, she’s still wary.

“I basically just have to trust the system,” she said. “And maybe you can understand why I’m a little reluctant to trust the system at this point.”

DeKalb County, Georgia, voter Rachael Holtzberg, 38, said she mailed her ballot a month ago from the United Kingdom, but that it's been ""stuck"" in the U.S. Postal Service system.

“And from everything I can see online, mine is sitting at a sorting center and has been in the sorting center in the Atlanta area for over two weeks now. And I feel a bit powerless,” Holtzberg said.

DeKalb County is continuing to count about 48,000 absentee ballots.

Holtzberg said she is tracking her ballot with DeKalb County by phone, the USPS website and Georgia’s Secretary of State voter page.

“I’ve been watching the election for four days now … and it’s getting really close in Georgia. And no matter the outcome, I want my vote to be counted,” she said.

In Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, Angelina Ortoleva said she can’t track down the absentee ballot she mailed in months ago because she can't find any information about it through the Pennsylvania Voter Services website. Allegheny County is also resuming the count and anticipating more overseas ballots.

“It says we are unable to match your information with our records,” Ortoleva, 24, said.

Ortoleva opted to vote by mail because of her work schedule as a nurse and traveling across the state to assist during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I do believe that my vote will not be counted. And that is scary to me, especially since Pennsylvania is still in the gray, still counting. And I could have been one of those votes. I could have helped put us over the edge one way or the other,” she said."
Criminal justice reformer unseats Los Angeles district attorney,"['Alicia Victoria Lozano', 'Alicia Victoria Lozano Is A Los Angeles-Based Digital Reporter For Nbc News.']","After a bitter race to lead the largest district attorney's office in the nation, reform candidate and former San Francisco D.A. George Gascón unseated Los Angeles County's first Black chief prosecutor.

With nearly 800,000 ballots still to be counted in Tuesday's election, Jackie Lacey conceded to Gascón on Friday in an emotional address attended by her staff and supporters.

""My consultants tell me that while I may close the gap between the two of us, I will not be able to make up enough based on the trending of the ballots to win this election,"" Lacey said. “I am so thankful to God for giving me this incredible opportunity to serve the people of Los Angeles County.”

The contest was regarded by many, and even Lacey herself, as an extension of the social unrest that spread across the country after George Floyd died in May while in Minneapolis police custody.

Lacey, who was also the county’s first female district attorney, acknowledged that “what happened in my election may one day be listed as a consequence of that” movement.

“It may be said that one day the results of this election is a result of our season of discontent and a demand to see a tsunami of change,” she said.

Gascón, a former Los Angeles police officer who oversaw reforms in the department following the Rampart corruption scandal of the 1990s, will lead an office with 1,000 lawyers and 300 investigators, and has billed himself as a steward for change.

He helped create the state’s first independent bureau to bring more transparency to investigations involving alleged police brutality, and he promised on Friday to reshape the prosecutor's office and hold law enforcement accountable for unjustified killings.

“Angelenos spoke loud and clear,” he said. “We need to start moving away from political rhetoric, and I think that we need to join hands.”

Lacey received mounting pressure from reform advocates in recent years, becoming the target of weekly protests led by Black Lives Matter-Los Angeles that largely focused on her cozy relationship with law enforcement and an unwillingness to prosecute police officers shown to have used excessive force.

Tensions between Lacey and BLM-L.A. escalated earlier this year when her husband pulled a gun on the organization’s co-founder Melina Adbullah. David Allan Lacey was charged in August by the California attorney general’s office with three counts of assault with a firearm, and he pleaded not guilty in October.

Abdullah previously told NBC that BLM-L.A. “had tried everything” to form a better relationship with Lacey, but the prosecutor repeatedly refused to meet with Adbullah in person or with the families of people who have been killed by law enforcement officers.

Gascón, on the other hand, has already reached out to Black Lives Matter-L.A. and promised to meet with victims’ families as early as next week, Abdullah said. While Abdullah credits Gascón for being willing to work with criminal justice reform advocates, the Black Lives Matter movement is not prepared to give him a free pass, she said.

“We are holding him accountable,” Abdullah said. “It doesn’t mean he’s going to be doing everything right, but we’re already seeing a corner be turned in the way we’re going to be interacting with him.”

Gascón, who immigrated to Los Angeles from Cuba as a teenager, was a longtime member of the Los Angeles Police Department before becoming chief of police in Mesa, Arizona in 2006. Then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom named him police chief of his city in 2009, and two years later Gascón filled the San Francisco district attorney's seat vacated by U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris when she became California Attorney General.

Lacey heavily criticized Gascón for not prosecuting police officers involved in killings during his eight-year tenure in San Francisco. He defended his decisions by saying all the victims were armed and the law strongly favored police.

Gascón also pushed back by citing Lacey’s own record of prosecuting only one manslaughter case against a law enforcement officer out of 340 fatal shootings during her two terms in office. He pointed to the $7 million Lacey’s campaign received from police unions in her bid for re-election.

Gascón, meanwhile, pulled in $12 million, mainly from wealthy donors bent on criminal justice reform, The Associated Press reported. Billionaire George Soros gave $2.25 million, and philanthropist Patty Quillin, who’s married to Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, gave $1.6 million, according to the Los Angeles Times. Hastings gave $500,000."

What 'provisional ballots' are and why it takes time to count them,"['Alex Seitz-Wald', 'Alex Seitz-Wald Is Senior Digital Politics Reporter For Nbc News.']","WASHINGTON — Provisional ballots — used by voters if there's a question about their eligibility when they show up at the polls — are slowing the count of the presidential election four days after polls closed. And there could be enough provisional ballots to affect the race in some key states.

Such ballots are used only when a voter has an issue that needs to be resolved before their vote can be counted, so they take longer to process than regular ballots and can be subject to legal action and challenges.

They are a fallback when a voter can't immediately prove they're eligible to vote when they show up at the polls or their information doesn't match what's listed on voter rolls.

The voter may have moved, but their new address is not reflected on the voter roll in their new precinct. They may have forgotten to bring an ID in a state that requires one to vote. They may have changed their name or their name may be misspelled on the rolls. Or they may have been removed from the rolls by a glitch or regular purge of voters who haven't cast a ballot in a long time.

And especially relevant this year, in some states, if a voter requested an absentee ballot but decided for whatever reason to vote in person, they may have been required to bring their absentee ballot to the voting place, where they would then hand it over in exchange for a new in-person ballot. That's done to ensure they don't vote twice.

Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics

If the voter never received their requested absentee ballot or forgot to bring it to the polls, they may end up having to vote provisional instead.

All of those issues take extra time to resolve as officials check to make sure that those provisional ballots are indeed eligible to be counted and to ensure that that voter didn't already vote absentee by mail.

Provisional ballots typically make up a tiny fraction of the vote — just 1.8 percent of votes cast in the 2016 presidential election, about 70 of which were ultimately accepted, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission— and have rarely altered the outcome of elections in the past.

""I'm not sure I've ever heard of an election turning on provisionals,"" said Paul Smith, a veteran elections lawyer and the vice president of the Campaign Legal Center, a non-partisan non-profit.

But things are different this year due to the large use of mail-in ballots amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

In a tight race, when even a small number of votes could potentially sway the result, media outlets that are forecasting the election want to wait to see what those ballots look like before they call races.

""The traditional assumption is that most provisional ballots are cast by Democrats...but that may not be this situation,"" said Smith. ""We've never had an election like this, and it's really hard to extrapolate from past elections the partisan makeup of this group of people — and it's a lot of people.""

When turnout is high — 2020 looks on track to break records — that means more first-time and irregular voters turned out, which means more provisional ballots typically get issued because those voters are not as familiar with the process and their information may not be up to date.

""The truth is that there may be many people coming to the polls for whom this is not a regular occurrence. They make mistakes,"" said Ted Shaw, the Julius L. Chambers Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of North Carolina. ""And the fact that there are more people means there are more who may make errors.""

One of the states that NBC News has not yet called is Pennsylvania, which would hand Joe Biden the presidency if his lead holds, as officials there work through the provisional and other ballots.

""The ballots are being counted. These are legal votes,"" Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said on MSNBC. ""I would just urge everyone to take a deep breath. I know it's hard. Everyone wants to have finality.""

And states give voters a chance to fix those issues, which takes time, too.

Provisional ballot rules vary by state, but in Pennsylvania, county boards of election have to adjudicate each individual ballot to determine whether it should be counted or not and they have one week to do it.

Pennsylvania officials said Friday morning they were just beginning to process provisional ballots and said they had at least 85,000, which could theoretically be enough for Trump to overcome Biden's roughly 19,000 vote lead.

In Georgia, meanwhile, where Biden leads by about 1,600 votes, officials said they had about 13,000 provisional ballots.

Provisional ballots have historically skewed Democratic, but this year there may be indications they are tilting Trump. That could be because more Trump voters showed up to cast their ballots in person, while many Democrats mailed the ballots.

""This is a year unlike any other,"" Shaw said."
"In Florida, Spanish-language misinformation embraces misleading Election Day claims","['Carmen Sesin', 'Carmen Sesin Is A Reporter Based In Miami.', 'April Glaser', 'April Glaser Is A Reporter On The Tech Investigations Team For Nbc News In San Francisco.']","MIAMI — As Joe Biden inches closer to winning in Pennsylvania and Georgia, Spanish-language disinformation is intensifying among Florida Latinos claiming fraud and rigged elections.

A well-known former candidate for state office in Florida posted an impassioned video in Spanish on Facebook boosting the baseless claim that the election is being stolen from President Donald Trump. The video has since been reposted to Twitter, where it’s been viewed more than 116,000 times over the past two days.

“You have the historical authority to destroy the communists that are in the department of elections,” the man said, adding that it’s time to take to the streets to defend Trump.

The new wave of false claims comes after Democrats raised alarms in the run-up to the election about Spanish-language misinformation that had circulated among Latino voters in Florida. And while researchers said Election Day passed without evidence of major English-language misinformation campaigns on social media, they cautioned that the coming days and weeks would be challenging.

On Friday morning, a doctored photo was being passed around in WhatsApp groups, a popular app among Latinos in Florida, showing Biden leaning uncomfortably close behind the former president of the National Electoral Council of Venezuela, who herself was accused of electoral fraud in the South American country. Her image has been used in various Spanish-language misinformation memes about the outcome of the U.S. election on WhatsApp.

Content posted to WhatsApp is only viewable to members of the group it's posted in, making it near-impossible to gauge the spread of disinformation on the app, which often circulates within multiple large, closed groups simultaneously with little oversight.

The misleading, false and conspiratorial claims that are circulating in Spanish about the outcome of the election are readily viewable on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, despite policies from all three companies prohibiting or restricting the spread of conspiracy theories and election-related misinformation. According to researchers interviewed by NBC News, the policies have been implemented with more consistency for content posted in English.

Growing Spanish-language disinformation

Flavia Colangelo, a researcher at GQR, a Democratic research firm that advises campaigns on Spanish-language disinformation, said she is concerned about what she is seeing in Spanish on social media platforms.

“Facebook and YouTube have taken steps to remove QAnon content in English from their platforms, but there is still a vast amount available in Spanish and it’s easily accessible,” she said.

Andrea Vallone, a spokeswoman for Facebook, told NBC News that the company has multiple fact-checking partners who review posts in Spanish on Facebook and Instagram to enforce the company’s policies against misleading and hateful information. The company has also been actively applying labels to posts in English and in Spanish on Facebook that discuss the election, linking users to a voter information center, which Facebook has translated into Spanish.

WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, also has a new feature that allows users to search the web about what’s being discussed in their chats, Vallone said, adding that this could help curb the spread of misinformation.

While some of the disinformation being spread on Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter and YouTube makes parallels between Biden and Latin American socialist countries, other posts are replicating conspiracy theories that have gained traction in English among conservative circles online.

Alex Joseph, a spokesperson for YouTube, said the company has policies against misinformation about how to vote but does not prohibit content that forwards false views about the outcome of the election.

""Expressing views on the outcome of a current election or process of counting votes is allowed under our policy,"" Joseph said. ""Our policies are global, and we apply them consistently across all languages and regions.""

In mid-October, YouTube extended its policies against hate and harassment ahead of the U.S. elections to include prohibitions on conspiracy theory videos, including videos on the massively popular and unfounded conspiracies about QAnon and ""pizzagate."" That prohibition, however, only extends to videos that target a specific group or individual with a conspiracy that has been used to justify real-world violence. Followers of both QAnon and ""pizzagate"" have allegedly been engaged in numerous violent crimes in recent years, including murder.

Spanish-language YouTube accounts that in the past have spread themes related to various conspiracy theories, including those alleging George Soros was funding immigration to the U.S., are now focused on the results of the U.S. elections. Many of these videos claim Biden is linked to socialism and question whether there has been fraud in the vote counting.

Twitter has also been a hotbed of Spanish-language disinformation surrounding the outcome of the election, according to researchers and posts viewed by NBC News.

Another viral conspiracy with no grounding in fact that has moved from Twitter to WhatsApp questions the legitimacy of the printed ballots in some states. It also claims Trump will send the National Guard to battleground states to run a secondary check on all the ballots, according to Twitter posts shared in large WhatsApp groups and obtained by NBC News.

Twitter spokesman Trenton Kennedy told NBC News that the company has a team working in multiple languages, including Spanish, monitoring content about the U.S. elections.

“We have and will continue to enforce our rules impartially to protect the integrity of the conversation around this election,” Kennedy said.

President's false claims, in Spanish

Many of the false claims amplify or exaggerate the messages coming directly from Trump’s public statements about electoral fraud. Twitter and Facebook have both actively applied various labels to Trump’s posts that violate their election-related misinformation policies.

The president’s campaign released a statement Friday morning saying, “We are confident we will find ballots improperly harvested,” regarding the vote-count process in Georgia.

The statement also said, “There were many irregularities in Pennsylvania, including having election officials prevent our volunteer legal observers from having meaningful access to vote counting locations.”

The same themes are emerging on viral Twitter posts, in WhatsApp groups, on Facebook and on YouTube channels in Spanish.

During the live broadcast of a popular analysis program on YouTube with almost half a million subscribers, the host began the show by questioning whether there has been fraud in the election. She also said it’s “suspicious” that in one state, Biden’s numbers continue to increase, while Trump’s numbers remain the same.

""Playing with fire""

In response, Trump supporters in Miami have been gathering outside La Carreta, a popular Cuban restaurant, to rally around unfounded claims of election fraud, which they’re sharing with the hashtag #StopTheBidenSteal. The protests have been peaceful.

Democratic strategist Evelyn Pérez Verdía, who monitors Spanish-language disinformation, said Trump is fueling anger among his supporters and it’s reflected in the disinformation being passed around.

“Trump and his campaign are playing with fire, they are playing with emotions. In their heart, they feel they are defending democracy, so it’s very dangerous and it’s coming from the mouth of the president and his campaign,"" she said.

Part of what is igniting the emotions in Florida is the vast population of Latinos who have come from countries with corrupt governments and have lived through fraudulent elections.

“It has created a lot of PTSD,” said Pérez Verdía, adding that the disinformation is making people feel like they are being cheated here after experiencing the downfall of democracy in their home countries.

Colangelo, the GQR researcher, fears the confusion and uncertainty over the election results are creating the perfect breeding ground for disinformation narratives to grow.

""When it comes to our democratic process, nothing is more important than ensuring confidence in our systems,"" Colangelo said, ""which is why our social media platforms need to act quicker to take down Spanish-language disinformation.""

"Eta could produce torrential rain, strong wind for South Florida","['Dennis Romero', 'Dennis Romero Writes For Nbc News', 'Is Based In Los Angeles.']","The former hurricane known as Eta was expected to regain strength Friday as it aimed its torrential rain and strong winds at South Florida and the Florida Keys, federal forecasters said.

Eta, which was downgraded to a tropical storm and then to a tropical depression Wednesday, caused a massive landslide Friday in San Cristobal Verapaz, Guatemala, where 100 people may have died, President Alejandro Giammattei said.

Video from Guatemala shows an army helicopter being used to rescue a family from a rooftop as flood waters inundated their community.

The storm Friday was about 115 miles east of Belize City, Belize, and was moving northeast at 7 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. It had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph as the Cayman Islands and parts of Cuba were under tropical storm warnings.

Moving across the northwestern Caribbean on Friday, Eta was expected to restrengthen to a tropical storm. It was forecast to spread heavy rain from Central America to southeastern Mexico and from Jamaica to the Cayman Islands.

Parts of South Florida and the Florida Keys were in for the possibility of 15 inches of rain by the time Eta brushes the coastline and then heads into the Gulf of Mexico on Monday, the center said.

Winds by then could reach 65 mph, too weak to be considered hurricane-force, said atmospheric research scientist Phil Klotzbach of Colorado State University.

The big concern as Eta aims for the U.S. is precipitation and the possibility of flash flooding, forecasters said.

""This is going to be a very big and very serious rain event,"" said National Hurricane Center meteorologist and spokesman Dennis Feltgen. ""There's a serious threat of some urban flooding.""

He urged Florida residents to pay attention to the forecast.

Eta is considered life-threatening in part because it's spending plenty of time in one place. ""The storm is forecast to move relatively slowly as it approaches"" the U.S., Klotzbach said by email.

U.S. landfall was yet to be forecast. Eta was expected to weaken after it enters the Gulf of Mexico, Feltgen said.

Eta is punctuating a record-setting year in which 11 named tropical cyclones have made landfall in the continental United States."
FDA panel rejects Biogen's new Alzheimer's drug,['The Associated Press'],"Government health advisers sharply criticized a closely watched Alzheimer’s drug on Friday, concluding there wasn’t enough evidence that the experimental drug slowed the brain-destroying disease.

The panel of outside experts for the Food and Drug Administration agreed that a pivotal study in patients failed to show “strong evidence” that the drug worked. The experts warned of multiple “red flags” with the data, which did not initially show any benefit until another analysis with later results.

“Alzheimer's treatment is a huge, urgent, unmet need,"" said panelist Dr. Joel Perlmutter, of Washington University School of Medicine. ""But if we approve something with data that is not strong we have the risk of delaying good, effective treatments.”

He was one of eight panelists who voted against the drug's evidence; one voted that the drug showed “strong evidence” and two members said they were undecided. The panel also rejected the merits of a second study of the drug.

The FDA is not required to follow the group’s guidance but their negative opinion could weigh heavily on the agency's decision on whether to greenlight the drug. The FDA is expected to make a decision by March.

The Biogen drug, known as aducanumab, does not cure or reverse Alzheimer’s; the claim is that it modestly slows the rate of decline. Current drugs only temporarily ease symptoms and no new options have emerged since 2003.

Much of panel’s commentary was a rejection of the FDA’s viewpoint. Earlier in the day, the FDA’s chief staff reviewer gave a glowing review of the drug, calling study data submitted by Biogen “exceptionally persuasive,” “strongly positive” and “robust.” But an FDA statistician noted flaws and inconsistencies in the results and potential safety issues.

""“It feels like the audio and video on TV are out of sync,” said panel member Dr. Caleb Alexander of Johns Hopkins University.

Friday’s meeting follows months of intense skepticism surrounding the drug, co-developed with Japan’s Eisai Co.

The drugmakers halted two studies of their drug last year after disappointing results. But several months later the companies reversed course, announcing that a new analysis showed the drug was effective at a higher dose and that the FDA advised that it might warrant approval.

More than 5 million people in the United States and many more worldwide have Alzheimer’s. Current drugs only temporarily ease symptoms and the last one was approved nearly two decades ago.

The drug is expected to be very expensive and “could bankrupt our health care system” while giving patients false hope, the consumer group Public Citizen warned in comments ahead of the meeting.

The FDA evaluation focuses on safety and effectiveness. But advocates for approval, including the Alzheimer’s Association, are pushing to make need part of the decision.

What is aducanumab?

Aducanumab aims to help clear harmful clumps of a protein called beta-amyloid from the brain. Other experimental drugs have done that but it made no difference in patients’ ability to think, care for themselves or live independently.

It's a biotech medicine made from living cells, and such drugs are very expensive. No price estimate has been announced for the drug, which is given through an IV once a month.

If aducanumab is approved, it’s expected to be covered by Medicare, the government plan for seniors. The FDA and Medicare are barred from considering cost when reviewing a new drug or treatment.

Even qualifying for the drug could be expensive. It’s only been tested in people with mild dementia from Alzheimer’s or a less severe condition called mild cognitive impairment. To verify a diagnosis has required brain scans that cost $5,000 or more. Insurers including Medicare don’t cover the scans because their benefits are unclear, but that could change if a scan becomes a gateway to treatment.

Does it work? The evidence

Historically, the FDA often required two studies showing safety and effectiveness, but in recent years has relaxed that standard.

Each of the two aducanumab studies enrolled about 1,650 people and were stopped roughly halfway through when it seemed the drug wasn’t working. Biogen says that later results show one study was positive at the highest dose; the second study was clearly negative. The company says an analysis from both studies on people who got the highest dose for the longest time shows benefit.

But there are many questions about the validity of such analyses. Another complication: the studies were changed after they were underway to let some people get a higher dose. And the placebo group in the positive study worsened more than the one in the negative study did, which could help explain why aducanumab appeared better by comparison in that one.

The FDA review largely dismissed safety concerns, including swelling in the brain that occurred in as many as one-third of patients, often leading to discontinuation of the drug.

The FDA should require a third study to test the drug in ideal conditions and get a clear answer, said the Mayo Clinic’s Dr. David Knopman, in an interview ahead of the meeting. He’s on the FDA advisory panel but didn't participate in Friday's meeting because he helped lead one study. He and other doctors published a journal report earlier this week arguing against approval.

What would it mean for patients?

Nearly a dozen Alzheimer’s patients, family members and doctors urged approval of the drug during a public comment period of the online meeting, saying the move would provide hope to patients and spur development of additional therapies.

But any benefit from the drug “is relatively small,” said Dr. Eliezer Masliah, neuroscience chief at the U.S. National Institute on Aging, commenting before the meeting.

In the positive study, the drug modestly slowed the rate of mental decline -- a difference of only 0.39 on an 18-point score of thinking skills. How much that means in terms of being able to live independently, recognize family members or remember things is unclear.

Drugs that remove amyloid may have to be combined with medicines that do other things in the brain, and used early enough before damage occurs, to do much good, Masliah said.

If the drug is approved, the American Academy of Neurology urged the FDA to not make it a broad authorization, which could expose many patients to a medicine that might harm rather than help, and could “overwhelm the health care system.”

Advocates race to find Georgia voters to correct bad ballots,[],"ATLANTA — Advocates for both presidential candidates raced to find every person in Georgia who submitted a flawed ballot before time ran out Friday to fix the paperwork in a race that could be decided by the narrowest of margins.

Hours before the 5 p.m. deadline, Christin Clatterbuck and Sarah Meng joined about 20 other volunteers who planned to visit addresses in suburban Atlanta’s Gwinnett County in search of voters whose ballots were initially rejected but could be fixed with a signature or an ID.

Cam Ashling, a Democratic activist who organized the small effort, gave instructions and a pep talk. “Never has it ever been more true than now that every vote counts,"" she shouted beside a pickup truck with a bed full of snacks, water and a big bottle of hand sanitizer.

Clatterbuck and Meng drove through suburban neighborhoods in their small SUV. They walked past rose bushes to knock on the door of a home in Lilburn where they were looking for a 19-year-old voter. Her dad answered and promised to call her at college.

Other problem ballots were cast by people not listed on the voter rolls who will need to explain why. They must correct, or “cure,” their ballots by the deadline for the votes to count.

No one knew how many flawed ballots needed to be fixed. Each of the state's 159 counties keeps its own tally.

At a second home, Clatterbuck and Meng did not find the voter, but a friend put her on the phone. She had failed to sign her ballot.

“As you know, it’s so, so, so important. Today by no seconds later than 5 o’clock,” Meng said, giving details on exactly what needed to be done.

Alex Upreti promised to help the friend fix her vote. Meng and Clatterbuck cheered.

The pair did not hit every home on the list. They decided to skip a house where an SUV in the driveway had a “Blue Lives Matter” sticker to show support for law enforcement in the face of Black Lives Matter protests against police brutality and racial injustice. The sticker suggested the home could be occupied by someone who backed President Donald Trump, a Republican.

They knocked on 10 doors in all. Half of the voters said they had already fixed the problems. No one answered at three houses.

Counties are required to contact voters with problem ballots so they can be fixed. Both political parties also have those lists and were reaching out.

“The voters I had talked to, they had already been talked to by like four people,” state. Rep. Bee Nguyen, an Atlanta Democrat who went door to door Wednesday in DeKalb County.

Some volunteers tried to call voters with ballot problems.

“It’s definitely hit or miss like anything. Think about a telemarketer,” said Aklima Khondoker, the Georgia state director of All Voting is Local. “Typically for me, when a strange phone number comes up, I think it is spam.”

Cobb County Republican Party Chairman Jason Shepherd sent out a call Thursday for volunteers to help the state party, saying Republicans were trying to fix provisional ballots. State GOP Political Director Joe Proenza referred comment to a Trump campaign spokesperson who did not respond to an email.

Democrat Joe Biden was leading President Donald Trump in Georgia by about 1,500 votes at midday, but final results will not be known for days. Under Georgia law, a candidate can request a recount if the margin is less than one half of one percentage point.

The Associated Press has not declared a winner in Georgia because the race remains too close to call. The state’s 16 electoral votes could clinch the contest for Biden in his quest for the 270 votes needed to win the presidency.

The secretary of state’s office said several thousand absentee ballots were still being counted. Another 8,900 ballots sent to military and overseas voters could be counted if received by the Friday deadline. Counties also have provisional ballots to review.

Gabriel Sterling, who has overseen the implementation of Georgia’s new electronic voting system, said the state’s counties have been working diligently to finish tabulating results. He emphasized his confidence in the legitimacy of the process. Any evidence-backed complaint will be investigated, he added.

“When you have a narrow margin, little, small things can make a difference. So everything’s going to have to be investigated to protect the integrity of the vote,” Sterling said.

After each county certifies its vote total, the state will perform an audit before issuing its own certification. Counties must certify their results by Nov. 13, and the state must certify them by Nov. 20.

Sexual assault charge against Jacob Blake dismissed in plea bargain agreement,"['David K. Li', 'David K.

Appearing via Zoom,Blake pleaded guilty to two counts of disorderly conduct and domestic abuse and was sentenced to two years of probation, Kenosha County court records showed.

In the deal, one count of criminal trespassing and one count of third-degree sexual assault and domestic abuse were dropped.

The charges stem from an incident in May, which occurred before police confronted him on Aug. 23. A bystander's cell phone video from the police incident appeared to show Blake trying to walk away from officers before he was shot at close range in the back.

Rusten Sheskey was identified as the officer who shot Blake.

The sexual assault charge stemmed from an incident in May, which was believed to be the reason for his attempted arrest by Kenosha police officers in August.

Blake previously pleaded not guilty to trespassing, sexual assault, and disorderly conduct. The three charges are related to an incident at the home of Blake's girlfriend.

His trial had been set to begin on Monday.

Blake's lawyer and the prosecutor overseeing the case could not be immediately reached for comment late Friday afternoon.

The police shooting of Blake touched off days of protests against police brutality and systemic racism.

Prosecutors say Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Antioch, Illinois, came to Kenosha during the protests and opened fire on two men, Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, killing them both and wounding a third man, Gaige Grosskreutz.

Rittenhouse has been charged with two counts of felony homicide in addition to attempted homicide, possession of a dangerous weapon while under the age of 18 and reckless endangerment, court records show.

Defense lawyers have said Rittenhouse acted in self-defense and that he was there to try to protect businesses."
Death of Black mother after birth of first child highlights racial disparities in maternal mortality,"['Minyvonne Burke', 'Minyvonne Burke Is A Breaking News Reporter For Nbc News.']","The death of a Black pediatrics doctor from postpartum complications after welcoming her first child is highlighting the racial disparities in maternal mortality rates.

Dr. Chaniece Wallace, 30, died on Oct. 22, just two days after she and her husband, Anthony Wallace Jr., welcomed their daughter, Charlotte.

The baby was born four weeks early via C-section after doctors learned that Chaniece had symptoms of preeclampsia, according to a GoFundMe page Anthony set up. Over the next two days after giving birth, Chaniece underwent emergency surgery due to complications, he said.

Dr. Chaniece Wallace. Indiana University School of Medicine

""Three of the main challenges we encountered were a ruptured liver, high blood pressure, and kidneys were not fully functioning,"" he wrote. ""Chaniece fought with every piece of strength, courage, and faith she had available.""

Preeclampsia is a blood pressure condition that usually begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy, according to Mayo Clinic. It can sometimes develop without any symptoms but signs of the condition include a rise in blood pressure, vision changes, severe headaches, signs of kidney and liver troubles, and upper abdominal pain.

It can lead to serious, even fatal, complications if left untreated.

Black women develop preeclampsia at a rate that is 60 percent higher than that of white women, according to a 2017 report by the Healthcare Cost Utilization Project. The report also found that the condition is less severe in white women than Black.

And data released in January by the National Center for Health Statistics show that Black women are affected by maternal mortality at a higher rate than white women. According to the data, the national maternal mortality rate was an estimated 17.4 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2018, when 658 women died.

Dr. Chaniece Wallace. via Facebook

Out of those 658 deaths, researchers found that Black women died 2.5 times more often than white women. Researchers do not have a clear explanation as to why that is.

Dr. Carmen Echols, a family medicine physician in the Atlanta metro area, said she believes there are a number of factors including the susceptibility to certain health conditions such as diabetes, high cholesterol, and obesity.

“Having those preexisting conditions, not being adequately managed and then you add on the physical, and in many cases, the psychological stress of pregnancy can make those already not-well controlled preexisting conditions, complications,"" she said in a phone interview Friday.

Echols said discrimination in the healthcare system and cultural bias in medical education are also contributors.

""Knowing that discrimination exists, that's going to be chronic stress on the body that can increase your blood pressure and the body can have physical weathering from that,"" she said.

""And when you think in terms of populations as well, just having decreased access to reproductive [and] preventative healthcare ... African American women as a whole have decreased access to those aspects of healthcare.""

She said that to begin to address the issue, there needs to be more discussion about it.

In an Oct. 27 tweet, Dr. Omolara Uwemedimo, a New York-based pediatrician and founder of Melanin Medicine & Motherhood, called for the protection of Black women.

""Dr. Chaniece Wallace. Say her name. We say protect Black women because you don't. All Black women, including health providers, who have dedicated their lives to keeping us alive,"" she wrote. ""My head says don't stop until Black women in medicine & academia are safe, protected & supported. But my heart hurts.""

Arabia Mollette, a physician and health expert from New York, said preeclampsia is one of the most preventable pregnancy complications, but the rates and prognosis is still higher in Black women.

""As a black woman doctor, my heart mourns for the loss of Dr. Wallace,"" she wrote, in part, on Facebook. ""I wish there was another outcome where she was here to raise her daughter, Charlotte. There needs to be a revolution in #Obstetrics.""

Prior to her death, Chaniece was working at Riley Children's Health Hospital in Indianapolis as a resident physician. Her husband said on the GoFundMe page that she had completed her board exams and had been interviewing for positions around the country.

Anthony could not be reached for comment Friday.

IU Riley Peds Residency said in an Instagram post that Chaniece's future impact was ""sure to be expansive"" and she was taken far too soon.

Anthony said that his daughter remains in the neonatal intensive care unit and ""is doing exceptionally well.""

""Chaniece although you are not with us physically, I will always carry you in my heart and share my wonderful memories of you with our daughter Charlotte. I am forever grateful for the five years God gave me with you,"" he wrote on the GoFundMe, which has raised more than $154,000 as of Friday afternoon.

A homegoing service for Chaniece is planned for Saturday."
Kindergartner reportedly dies of Covid-19 in Texas,"['Tim Fitzsimons', 'Tim Fitzsimons Reports On Lgbtq News For Nbc Out.']","A kindergarten student has died of Covid-19 at the Amarillo Independent School District in northern Texas, NBC affiliate KAMR reports.

Parents Lastassija White and Quincy Drone told the NBC affiliate that their five-year-old daughter Tagan died suddenly after a short battle with the virus.

""She loved to learn,"" White said, adding that her late daughter would so fastidious about wearing a mask that she would even remind her mom if she forgot hers.

White said Tagan became very sleepy last week, and then began to vomit, so she brought her to the emergency department where she tested positive for the coronavirus.

Tagan had no obvious symptoms like fever or cough. White told KAMR that doctors said her daughter ""would be fine"" because it ""doesn't affect kids.""

Tagan continued to weaken and her parents said they called the ambulance after it appeared that she had stopped breathing. She died shortly after.

“This doctor told us that our child would be fine, and our child didn’t even make it twenty-four hours. She died within the next fifteen hours,” Drone, Tagan's father, said.

Amarillo Health Department Director Casie Stoughton said the department is ""heartbroken and our thoughts and prayers go out to that particular family and any family who has lost someone here in our community,"" according to KAMR.

Stoughton declined to comment to NBC News, but a city spokesperson pointed to a statement shared yesterday with KAMR that said the department only reports cases, not deaths, in schools.

The Amarillo Independent School District superintendent did not respond to an NBC News request for comment.

The Amarrillo Globe-News reported Thursday that according to the most recent local health data, the Amarillo district has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the state among students and staff.

Could Black Men Help Flip Florida?,[],"About this episode:

In order to win the election in less than a week, Joe Biden and the Democratic Party need to do what Barack Obama did 12 years ago: expand the electorate. In 2008, 12 percent voters were people who hadn’t previously been participating, and 19 percent of all Black voters were new to the polls. But in 2016, many of them, including Black men, stayed home. Now, a grassroots effort is building to re-engage these men.

Into America heads to the swing state of Florida, where local Black elected officials are leading the effort to reach out to Black men. Trymaine Lee talks with a Miami native, Maurice Hanks, about his ups and downs with political participation over the years. And we hear from Florida State Senator Randolph Bracy, who is using unconventional methods to prove to Black men that their votes have power.

Why Is This Happening? Remembering America's prophet of freedom with David Blight: podcast and transcript,['Why Is This Happening'],"Who should we be building monuments to in America? Few figures have pushed for a truly fair and equal society in this country like Frederick Douglass. A man who saw the full promise of American democracy even years before the start of the Civil War.

This week Chris sits down with professor and historian David Bligt to talk about his Pulitzer winning book ""Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom."" The two discuss the life of the freed slave, orator, and writer whose words would go on to push America toward the multi-racial, multi-religious, multi-ethnic democracy that we still are striving for today.

Note: This is a rough transcript — please excuse any typos.

DAVID BLIGHT:

Multiculturalism, we use it so loosely that we don't even know what it means anymore. Well, Douglass knew what it meant. It meant the dream put into reality that people of every kind of creed, every kind of race background, ethnicity difference, even though they're going to fight it out, they're going to fight like hell over the sources, and meaning, and religion, and interpretation. They're going to fight like hell, but it's possible to create a democracy in which all of them can actually live. Chris Hayes:

CHRIS HAYES:

Hello and welcome to ""Why Is This Happening"" with me, your host, Chris Hayes. Once again, we are here in the quarantine closet, however many weeks we are into the COVID-19 quarantine. And there's been a lot of discussion about reckoning with our past, reckoning with our history. We've seen these protesters in city to city tearing down Confederate monuments. Many of which, if not most of which are actually not erected in the period of the Confederacy or after the civil war. I mean, it would be a weird thing to do right after you lost. They tend to be erected in the late 19th century into the 1920s and thirties, even sometimes in the wake of Brown v. Board of Ed. as essentially contemporaneous statements of white supremacy and domination over free black citizens. And so what we seen in these battles is that these sort of totems and the statues and symbols have real political power and they are often erected as moments of political expression.

And there's also been this kind of debate that they have occasioned about which figures should be on which side of the line. It seems very clear to me that every Confederate monument in the country should be torn down. But then there's a question of Christopher Columbus, question of Teddy Roosevelt or Washington and Jefferson who of course are founding fathers and also owned slaves and partook in this irredeemable and unforgivable evil system. And all of that has sort of had me thinking about, well, who should we be building more statues to, right? Like all this has been kind of a weirdly negative conversation about the statues and monuments we have. And often because those statues and monuments reflect who's in power and who's in power often is a lot of people who have not great records on many of the things that we care deeply about.

But one of the great lies that we are told and tell ourselves as Americans is a kind of like, they didn't know better lie. It's the way that we cast back into history and say, ""Well, you can't really criticize Christopher Columbus. You know, he didn't really realize the indigenous people were human beings who shouldn't have their hands chopped off and shouldn't have 14 year old girls requisitioned in sexual slavery."" But the fact of the matter is they're actual contemporary critics of Christopher Columbus is to say that what he's doing on the Island of Hispaniola is an abomination against God. They knew then. Same thing with Andrew Jackson's Trail of Tears. It wasn't like Andrew Jackson didn't know he was committing ethnic cleansing. In fact, the debate on the floor of the house during the Trail of Tears was about the human rights, they didn't use that term, abomination that Andrew Jackson wanted ordered. And so was it with slavery. And so was it with the central conceit of genuine multiracial democracy.

I mean, we think here in 2020, we're working towards genuine multiracial democracy and we want a full and equal shared democratic polity across lines of gender, across lines of race and religion and also sexual identity. And that that's kind of a new idea. Well, it's not a new idea. In fact, arguably the greatest American ever, top three, saw very clearly that this must be, that it was the only just at appropriate destiny for the nation to be a true multiracial democracy. And he saw it clearly 25 years before the civil war. And he is one of the greatest American heroes we have. There should be statutes to him everywhere. It's not that he's unknown. His name is Frederick Douglass. You have, of course, heard of him. He's getting recognized more and more. But he is a figure of, I think, of singular towering influence and importance in the America we want to be.

If you could think about a founding father for the nation, that was a founding father who truly captured intellectually and in their life, the vision for a full and equitable just American democracy, Frederick Douglass probably comes closest. If you were to choose one, if you were to choose one to start a new Mount Rushmore. A Mount Rushmore towards multi-racial multi-ethnic gender equitable, and there's a complicated story there, American democracy, you would put Frederick Douglass on that Mount Rushmore. You would erect statues to him. And all of this is very fresh in my mind because I had the great pleasure of reading this incredibly masterful biography.

You've probably heard of this book because it got a tremendous amount of attention and I believe it won the Pulitzer Prize. It won a bunch of awards. So you can't keep track of them. It's called Frederick Douglass, Profit of Freedom. It's a long study of the man's life. And it was written by DAVID BLIGHT, who's a Sterling Professor of American History, Director of the Gilder Lehrman Center for the study of slavery resistance and abolition at Yale University. And ever since I read the book, I've been wanting to talk to him about it. So it's my great pleasure to welcome DAVID BLIGHT. David, thanks for coming on.

DAVID BLIGHT:

Thank you, Chris. It's great honor.

CHRIS HAYES:

Let's talk about your way into this man who, he's one of these figures where... I think this is sort of the case a little bit with Hamilton and Chernow's biography and then the musical, which is that, sure, it's not like Alexander Hamilton is not famous. He's famous. We know Hamilton's a founding father, but the depth of complexity of the guy's life, it's like you read it. And you're like, ""Whoa, wow."" And Frederick Douglass is in a somewhat similar category in so far as like, yes, we know Fredrick Douglass. When we see his picture, we recognize him. But the sheer volume of his thought, his writing, his speaking, his political influence, his life experience. I had no idea the life this man lived.

DAVID BLIGHT:

Well, to go right back to your central point in your introduction. He did have a vision of a multiethnic, multiracial, multireligious America in a more robust way than almost anybody of his own time. Long before an idea like multiculturalism was any form of consensus in this country. He was the prose poet, if you like, of American democracy in the 19th century. He was a creature of words. We can come back to that if you want of just how a former slave, a kid who grows up a slave spends 20 years as a slave, become such a genius with language. But he managed to find in language, written prose, autobiographical prose, political editorials, thousands of speeches, even one work of fiction. He found ways to penetrate and explain, describe and explain the experience of slavery as both physical and mental. The experiences of racism, they didn't use that term in the 19th century. They called it racial prejudice, et cetera. And, and he found ways to explain what was happening to the American nation, the country itself, because of this issue of slavery and its aftermath, like nobody else.

Whether he belongs on a Mount Rushmore. I don't know, on that issue, it's worth talking about as we go through these monument wars, whether we've almost been too obsessed with people on monuments, and maybe we need to think more and more about memorialization, about ideas and concepts and events and processes, and so on. This obsession with heroes sometimes just gets us in trouble because everybody's got flaws. That's why George Washington is now in trouble, right, on the monuments.

CHRIS HAYES:

Right. Well, and it's also, I mean, after my encomium Frederick Douglass, he was, of course, not unflawed either.

DAVID BLIGHT:

No, he's deeply human and not perfect.

CHRIS HAYES:

Deeply human, and when we'll get to the... I want to get to the fight over the 14th amendment, which to me is in some ways the most interesting, one of the most interesting moments in all of American history. But first, I guess, for people that have not read the biography, which is probably the large majority of the listeners right now, just tell me a little bit about how does Frederick Douglass become Frederick Douglass? What is the story of a child born into slavery who becomes the great writer and orator?

DAVID BLIGHT:

Well, he's born out in an isolated corner of the Eastern shore of Maryland. 1818. If he hadn't moved to Baltimore, when he was seven, eight years old and spent nine of his 10 years as a slave back and forth in Baltimore, we probably wouldn't ever know about him. There he lived in an urban setting, a great ocean port, where he could see the world coming in and out. He worked in maritime trades. He learned his literacy and he explored his literacy. He also lived in close proximity in Baltimore. In fact, he lived within, in many ways, a free black community. Baltimore in the year, he escaped at 1838 had about 3000 slaves, but it had about 17,000 free blacks. It was a very robust community, lots of churches, fraternal orders, debating societies, even got involved in the debating society. It's where he meets his first wife, Anna Murray. He got engaged with certain ministers and preachers who helped him find his voice. But what Frederick Bailey, which was his original name was, what Frederick Bailey locked on to as a kid were words and language. Now we don't know entirely why that happened, except like every kid it's clear to me from all the sources we have, including his autobiographies, that he found the one thing he was really good at, which is what most kids want to find. He found he was good with words and language, especially oratorical language. And he was already preaching informally while he was still a slave by the age of 17 and 18, sometimes just outdoors and brush arbors with his so-called, what he called his band of brothers on Sunday afternoons. So how does this guy become Frederick Douglass? Well, by the time he escapes at age 20 through New York city and then to New Bedford, Massachusetts, one of the first things he did in New Bedford was to go down to the local AME church, little black church, AME Zion church. And within the first year he was there, they had him up front preaching. They found out this kid could preach. And that's where he began to hone his homiletics. He learned how to preach to the text in the Protestant tradition. And within another year, he was discovered preaching there by some adherence of William Lloyd Garrison, the great abolitionist from Boston. They invited him out to Nantucket, famously he gives his first speech to white people. He's only 23 years old. And all of a sudden he was hired to go out on the abolition circuit.

So words from the very beginning and actually throughout his life became Douglass' coin. And they became the only real weapon you ever had. The only real power he ever had. He never had elective office. He never sought elective office. He got a little bit of power after the war to some degree as an advisor to presidents as the kind of Republican party insider. But the only power this man ever really had was this power of language. And that's in some ways his greatest legacy, if we're looking for somebody who basically led prophetically with language, he's the prototype for anyone to follow.

CHRIS HAYES:

Well, it also hits home. I mean, this is an obvious point, but the point kept coming back to me, as I read the biography, is the fear of literacy, the fear of language by the slaver class. The fact that it was illegal to teach slaves to read in many places, the fact that it had to be undertaken in underground. The incredible thirst and yearning among slaves for literacy. I mean, we see that in the wake of the fall of the Confederacy when the Freedmen's Bureau is set up, just every school is just oversubscribed and people of all ages huddling towards the schoolhouse to learn how to read. Douglass' story, I mean, one of the things you cannot help, but wonder is that Douglass is obviously a genius and singular, but how many Frederick Douglass' there were, it is sort of this kismet accident.

DAVID BLIGHT:

Or could have been.

CHRIS HAYES:

It could have been, right, because of the wife of the one's owner who was kind of sympathetic and taught him how to read. And then he, you know, the situation, he ends up with a power of language that's denied to millions. And he's just the one that we know.

DAVID BLIGHT:

Yes, and it is an age of language, let's remember. It's an age of oratory. It's an age of the spoken, written and published word. I mean, to Douglass, like other abolitionists, the other technology in his life that was so important was the rotary press, the printing press. And of course, one of the first things he does when he comes back from England in 1847, is he tries to create his own newspaper, which he will run for 16 years. That newspaper, today with so many kinds of technologies, which you and your business masters, but that printing press and that newspaper was his voice. And back to words again, when he sat down in the winter of 1844-45 after three and a half years out on the circuit as this itinerant abolitionist orator, basically telling the stories of his youth mostly and also aiming directly at American secular and religious hypocrisy as nobody else was, he publishes that first narrative, that first autobiography. It's only 115-20 pages, and that he could take that book out now as he did, he went off to England, Ireland, Scotland, Britain. He couldn't even keep it in print, it was so popular. He could hold that book in his hand and he could say, ""Look. I was a slave and I'm black, and the world believes that black people don't have a history, are not literate people. But look at me. Here's my life. I wrote this. I am an equal human because I write. I am because I write."" I've said this many times to public audiences when they asked me what would Douglass believe was his most important this or that, and I usually end up saying one way or another, he would probably pull a pen out of his pocket and he would say, ""I am a writer."" And one thing people need to know if they know about Douglass the orator, and they may have read a speech here or there like the 4th of July speech, every major Douglass speech, and there are lots of them, exist in text. He wrote them down. He wasn't just the preacher who could walk into a hall and blow out the lights, although he could do that, too, if you wanted him to. But he wrote these things down in 25 page texts, then he would take it out on the road. Of course, he'd riff on and off it. But he was a writer, and that took time. He came out of slavery an orator. Writing is harder. It took him time to master writing, and he had some help with that.

CHRIS HAYES:

One thing that you can't help but think about when you read the book is the technologies of communication persuasion at the time. You've just sort of named two of them and I think we can talk about them, but one is the abolition circuit. So to go back to think about a social movement that is advancing this cause. It's a just cause, but in some ways radical, certainly. It's not like it's one of these, ""Oh, sure. Everyone was an abolition..."" No, not really. It was-

DAVID BLIGHT:

A small percentage, even of upstate New York.

CHRIS HAYES:

Very, right. You've got this basically small radical fringe movement attempting to seize the consciousness of the nation, and of course there's no broadcast, there's no TV, there's no internet, all that things. The speaking circuit's a huge part of how you do that at the time. Describe what that is. I mean, this is how Douglass first enters public life as a person who goes around to say, ""Listen to me tell you about the depredations of slavery.""

DAVID BLIGHT:

Well, in his early years, 1840s, the way the abolitionist circuit worked is they would send out troops, groups of speakers. There would easily be three, four or five of them at a time. They would hold anti-slavery meetings, and sometimes outdoors, sometimes in churches, sometimes in city halls, wherever they could get a venue, and they weren't always welcome. But then they would have resolutions to speak to, this resolution or that resolution, and the speakers would speak to or against it and so on. But one of their purposes, especially these Garrisonians, the followers of William Lloyd Garrison, was to stimulate a response in their audience, to anger their audience, to rile up their audience. And indeed, if the audience ended up throwing a few things at them, that was a success.

DAVID BLIGHT:

But what happened early on those first three years he's out on the circuit, Douglass was so adept at mimicry and so adept at making the case, especially against religious hypocrisy, and these are all well-churched people, well-churched towns, they're often speaking in Protestant pulpits. He gave this speech over and over and over again that became known as the Slaveholder's Sermon. What it was, Douglass would sometimes go into a performance. He was a performer, to say the least, and he's only in his 20s, let's remember. He was this dashing handsome tall kid right out of slavery, so it seemed, until, he started to talk, but he would go and he would mimic a pro-slavery preacher. ""Slaves be loyal to your masters,"" and he'd quote that stuff out of the Bible. And he'd entertain people and they'd laugh and they'd cry. And there were times, and I have a couple examples of this in the book, where the abolitionist speakers will be speaking to this resolution or that resolution and somebody in the audience would shut up, ""Hey, Fred. Do the sermon,"" and he'd break into the sermon. So he learned early on the performance of nature of this kind of oratory.

And then later, he does the same thing with all kinds of political issues, all kinds of the politics of slavery, whether that was about the Fugitive Slave Act of the Kansas-Nebraska Act or fugitive slave rescues, bleeding Kansas and on down the line. He understood as any major orator at that time had to, that this was about public persuasion. It was about performance and he had learned early on that you had to reach the moral heart of your audience and then hope that you could reach their political behavior, and he happened to be very good at it.

In fact, he was so good at it that by the 1850s, it became, again, I say this in the book, it became a kind of, and even after the war even more so, it became a kind of an American thing to see Douglass, to go hear Douglass. And I have many examples that I didn't even use in the book, especially later in his life, of people reflecting in newspapers about the first time they heard Douglass, the first time they saw Douglass. It was like seeing Niagara Falls. I saw Douglass.

CHRIS HAYES:

Yeah. It's funny because it reminded me when I took a Russian literature class, Tolstoy, who I did not realize until I took this class was, was a legend, was a famous sort of celebrity in his time that people talked about.

DAVID BLIGHT:

And a great storyteller. A great storyteller.

CHRIS HAYES:

That's right, and a great storyteller, and people talked about and they wanted ... and so I didn't quite realize the level of it. Or Dickens is the same thing. I mean, people go see. It's Dickens. People knew who Dickens was. The degree to which he was a legend in his time and his fame and the word of mouth about what it meant to watch this man perform. And so he does this oratory and then he writes the book and he goes. Talk about the European tour because it's fascinating to me, his reception there, and that is a kind of turning point in his life.

DAVID BLIGHT:

Well, it is. He's 27. He's just published the narrative. It's the summer of 1845. He plans this visit to the British Isles under the sponsorship of Garrison's operation in Boston. It isn't clear how long he had intended to stay, but he ends up staying about 19 months, one month in Ireland, several months in Scotland, and then most of the rest of it between Britain and Scotland. They fell in love with him, especially the reform world of Ireland, Scotland, and Britain. By then, of course, Britain had freed it slaves throughout its empire with mixed results and so on, and nevertheless, Britain saw itself as an anti-slavery nation.

And here was this young African American brilliant speaker. He took the place by storm. They loved him in Ireland. In fact, to this day, you'd think he was a born patron saint of Ireland or something. He only spent one month in Ireland and there are at least two monuments of him, at least two or three murals. Scotland was perfect because he arrived in the midst of a classic Scottish ecumenical war. They were having this huge battle over money that had been raised among American slaveholders. And there was this crusade going on called Send Back The Money. Well, this is Douglass's favorite subject, religious hypocrisy. He hit the ground running. They loved him. They wrote songs about him and they wrote poems about him. He would walk into a small town in upper and there'd be a little children's choir singing a song about him. I mean, and Douglass is 27. He's 28. He's overwhelmed by it.

CHRIS HAYES:

It makes an enormous ... I mean, he is blown away, too.

DAVID BLIGHT:

He'd never experienced a place that, well, he experienced some racism in the British Isles, but nothing like in the US. He was warmly accepted. He was admired. It almost overwhelmed him. And then in Britain, he meets all the famous reformers, politicians, and he makes a lot of lifetime British friends, a group of whom raise the money to purchase his freedom from the Auld brothers back in Maryland. And he returns to the US, but not until he had those free papers in his hand. He was formally and legally free once he returned to America.

CHRIS HAYES:

Right, and we should, of course, recall for people that don't remember their history, this is amidst the great battles over the domain of slavery in the nation in the run up to the Civil War. The Fugitive Slave Act, of course, the sort of most famous legislative blow to essentially allow for the federal government to essentially bless the operations of slave catchers, of kidnappers in the free states. This is one of, you said Kansas-Nebraska Act and Bleeding Kansas, it's one of a sort of series of pitched conflicts and battles that lead up to the Civil War. So this is a man who was a freed slave in the North at a time when that didn't mean a lot.

DAVID BLIGHT:

Yeah, and he returns in 1847 in the midst of the Mexican War. There's this war of westward expansion and slavery expansion that has just exploded. And by the way, you've read the books and you know this, but when he returned there in '47, he was a very angry young black man, because he had just been treated mostly like a conquering hero for the last 19 months and he knows he's returning to the hot house of American racism, pro-slavery America, and he is so angry.

He comes back, and a primary line in all of his speeches the first months he's back is, ""My country hates me and I hate it back. I have no country. I have no patriotism,"" and on and on he would go just brutally chastising the country. And one time Wendell Phillips, famous abolitionist, took him aside and he says, Fred, tone it down, man. I mean, you can lose the audience here. But he didn't turn it down.

And it was a Douglass now who was feeling much more independent with his voice, with his life. The trouble was how do you make a living at this? As I've always said to my students, being an abolitionist was not a good career move. It just, it's not. There's nothing upwardly mobile about it.

CHRIS HAYES:

Right, right.

DAVID BLIGHT:

He goes out to Rochester, creates a newspaper, has five children by 1849, and is trying to make ends meet, and the only way he could make a dime now was with his pen and his voice. And for the next 30 some years until 1877, when Rutherford Hayes appointed him to his first federal appointment, he never made any money except with his voice and his pen. There are people today making a living with their voice and their pen, but that's never been easy.

CHRIS HAYES:

Let's talk a little bit when you talk about his anger there, that's obviously an emotional characterization of a state of mind, but it relates to the evolving political, I think it's fair to say kind of political theology, of Frederick Douglass who comes up through a very churched universe. He encounters a certain world through, through homiletics-

DAVID BLIGHT:

Very biblical worldview, yeah.

CHRIS HAYES:

Yes. And for the people that know the sort of famous speeches of his, what to the slave is Fourth of July and the one that he gives at the Friedman's monument in Washington, what's so fascinating is he begins to develop a political theory that is at once kind of radical and liberal. It is in a fascinating space in that it is full of appropriately righteous fury-

DAVID BLIGHT:

Oh, yeah.

CHRIS HAYES:

... at the nation and its utter evil and hypocrisy, but finds something to redeem in it ultimately as a project.

DAVID BLIGHT:

He does, and you hit it right on the head. He is at times a genuine radical who flirts with, by the 1850s, uses of violence. He is up willing to use almost any strategy available. He can speak revolution with almost anyone. However, he's also an evolving political liberal, and that he wants to believe, and he actually does believe and wants to believe even in the bleakest of moments, that solutions can be found through politics, through the vote if black folk could ever get the vote. He much prefers somehow changing the country through law, through politics, if it's possible. But of course the 1850s is a decade, an extremely important decade in American history, when that kind of faith is put to the ultimate test. How do you keep faith in ultimate future freedom for black people after the Kansas-Nebraska Act, after especially the Dred Scott decision and the day after the Dred Scott decision, which said black people had no rights, which white people or the nation would ever need to adhere to all black people lived in the land of the Dred Scott case and not in the land of anything else, but what Douglass had faith in, and you can't underestimate this, is the natural rights tradition. And by that, I mean basically the creeds, the first principles of Jefferson's Declaration of Independence. To Douglass, the Declaration of Independence wasn't Jefferson. He give Jefferson credit for writing it, but the principles of the Declaration of Independence, to Douglass, as he once put it were like precious ore. They came from the earth or they came from God or they came from nature, they were nature's laws. You're born with certain inalienable liberties that no one can take away from you. Now, he had both that secular faith that would sustained him usually, but he also drew upon this apocalyptic millennialist biblical view of history. Whatever we think of it today, it was a different thing in the 19th century. It was this belief that somehow God had his hands in history, God was going to choose moments to enter history.

In the 19th century, they always called it Divine Providence, would somehow find moments and some of those moments would be horrific. Whole societies might get overturned as in the Old Testament and Douglass drew especially from his deep reading of the Hebrew prophets. His favorite prophet was Isaiah, but so was Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Amos and he also drew off Genesis many times. The Old Testament and the Hebrew prophets were the source of Douglass' storytelling when he needed in a crisis, in a terrible catastrophic moment. Whether that was Fugitive Slave Act, Dred Scott case, secession, the terrible civil rights case of 1883 which obliterates the 14th amendment, he would fall back on this ancient wisdom, this ancient faith. Now, that wasn't always easy to do and a lot of his followers sometimes said, ""Come on, Fred, you've been preaching that line for decades. What do we have faith in now?""

And then, when the lynching crisis comes in the 1890s, ""Where do we find faith now?"" And he even found at the end of his famous speech on lynching, he found another way to put his hope in natural rights. Now, without these two deep old traditions, there's no way he could have sustained faith in America. He probably would have had to emigrate, like some other people chose to. He also had one other thing that sustained him, and it brings us back to where we were before. He could write. He could vent all of this, he could express it with his voice and his pen. And you understand that. How many times in your own work, you're struggling, you're angry, you're frustrated, but you sit down-

CHRIS HAYES:

You have the outlet.

DAVID BLIGHT:

You have the outlet, you process it in words, you put it into a paragraph. And this I learned about Douglass over and over and over, in a crisis, whatever it was, he would go to his desk, sit down, write it up and figure out what he thought about it. And that almost always became a speech. And he'd took it out on the road. If he didn't have that power, who knows? Where does he turn?

CHRIS HAYES:

Yeah. How do you sustain it? And I think that we should say that the Old Testament ideas of Divine Providence and millennial expectations of cataclysm are not crazy in the years between, say 1852 and 1865, because the country, it's literally coming apart before everyone's eyes. Everyone sees that happening.

DAVID BLIGHT:

Both sides in that war basically interpreted it from that same position. It's always a struggle figuring out the difference between what he actually believes religiously. That's never as easily discerned, and how he's using biblical rhetoric and biblical storytelling and worldviews. Those are not always the same thing.

CHRIS HAYES:

Yeah, and that comes from the book. It's just clearly that it's the vocabulary he speaks, it's the universe of references that his audience has. And so, it's the lingua franca of the time is that, and the degree to which-

DAVID BLIGHT:

It is. Lincoln used it. Lincoln used it all the time.

CHRIS HAYES:

All the time, and the entire abolition movement, the abolitionist movement is a movement born of that. There's no way of conceiving of it independent of its spiritual dimension. Again, it's hard to express, I think, how for someone like Frederick Douglass and other abolitionists, white and black but obviously more black abolitionists whose bodies are on the line in a way that no white person's ever is, the lead up to the Civil War is a succession of setbacks.

DAVID BLIGHT:

Oh, yeah.

CHRIS HAYES:

They keep losing in the run up. Kansas, Nebraska and Dred Scott. It's not like... They're not winning the case of full liberty, abolition and free and equal representation.

DAVID BLIGHT:

No, in fact you could argue that the most despairing little period in this whole epic is the three years between Dred Scott and the secession crisis. There were movements then led by blacks to emigrate from the country. Martin Delaney led one of them, Henry Highland Garnet led another one. Douglass always argued against that, but he actually came close. He actually, on the brink of the war, had booked tickets for he and his daughter, his oldest child was Rosetta who was by then I think 22. They were going to go visit Haiti and see what it looked like. There was a Haitian immigration scheme going on, and he had booked the ticket about eight days or so after Fort Sumpter. And Fort Sumpter happened, and then there's this little column in his newspaper that says trip to Haiti canceled because the events were happening.

Now, this is another thing about Douglass, he really learned, as any rhetorician has to. If your only weapon is your voice and your pen, you got to learn to exploit crises. You got to learn to use the moment when you have one, like we're living in now. How many times have you heard this or even said it? ""We're having a reckoning. We've got to make the best of it. We got to exploit it,"" and so on. That is exactly what he did was secession is exactly what he did with the outbreak of the war. But it was the result, as you just suggested, of years of pent up agony, pent up despair. And what he became overnight, and I have a whole chapter in this, when the war broke out is a virulent war propagandist. He created some of the nastiest, violent war propaganda in language you'll ever want to read. He created slaveholders into the horrible Hun and they must be destroyed. And I think that reflected in Douglass, and I say this at length, an old rage in him that goes back to 20 years as a slave and the hundreds of years of slavery for the rest of his people. Now, there was a sanctioned war against that system and he wasn't going to let this opportunity pass by if he could help it.

CHRIS HAYES:

So I want to ask you about one of the most interesting relationships in all of American history. The relationship between Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. Right after this.

It is through this period, this is the time when the Republican Party is founded, obviously, right around with Lincoln's election and then the secession crisis, soon thereafter is assumption. And then, talk about the beginnings of the relationship, to the extent there is one, between Douglass and Lincoln, because that's one of the most fascinating relationships in American history.

DAVID BLIGHT:

It is, it becomes one. Douglass first is aware of Lincoln only in about 1858. He became aware of Lincoln because of the Lincoln-Douglas, Stephen Douglas debates out of Illinois for the US Senate. In fact, Douglass was actually in Illinois during at least a couple of those debates. I couldn't determine whether he actually attended one, wouldn't that be cool, but he was there. He followed it in the press. He was entirely aware of the substance of those great debates and that these two guys were debating the future of slavery. Then, in the 1860 election, Douglass still didn't know quite what to do with Lincoln. He viewed Lincoln as essentially what Lincoln was at that point, certainly on the surface, which was this old Henry Clay Whig who had become a moderate Republican, but who was antislavery. In fact, he admired, he said in 1860, Lincoln's antislavery tendencies. Well, to a radical abolitionist, tendencies still wasn't enough.

So, he wasn't sure. He actually... I'm not even sure that he voted for Lincoln in 1860, because there was still this thing, this tiny little far out party in New York called the Radical Abolition Party. And I think he may have thrown his vote away in that election. I know he did in 1858, but at any rate, once the war was on, Douglass tried to shoulder up to Lincoln and the Republicans. But of course, in the first year and a half of the war, the Lincoln administration is not making this war a battle against slavery. They're trying to contain it, trying to keep it a limited war. Fugitive slaves are being returned, or so they tried, and Douglass for that first year of the war became a ferocious critic of Lincoln.

CHRIS HAYES:

The North is also getting it's ass kicked a bunch. The war's not going well.

DAVID BLIGHT:

Oh, yeah. There's no clear outcome of any kind yet, much less an anti-slavery outcome. His tune on Lincoln will change finally with the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation in September of 1862. And then, decidedly changes with the final proclamation in January 1863, but that's an absolute torturous process of finding out what to believe in and how.

CHRIS HAYES:

And also, what can be trusted here. If you go back to the Lincoln-Douglas debates, and Lincoln spends a ton of time assuring his white audience that just because he doesn't believe in slavery, he doesn't like black people. He doesn't think they're equal. There's tremendous pains being taken at every step along the way to assure moderate white pro-unionists or people who... That, ""Don't worry. We don't believe in equality. We're not one of those crazy people."" And of course Douglass and the rest of free black society and enslaved blacks who hear this, they hear this, they know what...

DAVID BLIGHT:

Well, and it's classic wedge politics. Steven Douglas portrays Lincoln as this inward loving radical Jacobin, who, if you elect him, he'll have blacks and whites all intermarrying each other. In fact, in the Lincoln Douglas debates, Stephen Douglas used Frederick Douglass' name. He made up this crazy story that Abraham Lincoln had been seen riding in a cage with Fred Douglass. And of course, that wasn't true, but that's how famous Douglass already was, that he would be used. It was like they used to do with Nancy Pelosi and Ted Kennedy-

CHRIS HAYES:

Yes, exactly. Right, yeah.

DAVID BLIGHT:

""Oh, it's just another Ted Kennedy.""

CHRIS HAYES:

Yeah.

DAVID BLIGHT:

Or worse, but it is about who you can trust. And the other key thing here is, say in the middle of the succession crisis for example, and then right on through up into 1863, Dallas is not an insider in the Republican Party. He does not know them yet. He's going to know them later, but he doesn't know these people. He's not inside the circles of this. He doesn't know some of the machinations going on in 1862, but he doesn't know that Lincoln's been over at the war department crafting this proclamation. Nobody knew, frankly, but Douglass is not an insider. So, he's sitting there in Rochester, New York, reading every newspaper he can get and then weighing in himself in his monthly newspaper and trying, and then going out on the road constantly to speak and trying to have a voice in this terrible crisis that is existential. Existential for the country, for his family, for his people, for everything that he knows. And then, after Emancipation Proclamation, it's existential especially for his sons because he recruits two of them into the army.

CHRIS HAYES:

That's right. And that is a good point to emphasize something that I just want to make sure that we emphasize in this conversation, which is that Frederick Douglass, obviously as we said in the beginning, he's a genius, he's a one in a million talent. But the story of black resistance to slavery, the story of black abolition as a story of self-determination, as opposed to the Garrisonian tradition of noblest oblige or spiritual emancipation for these other people that you take pity on, is a story that I think has been obscured for very long but has moved in the scholarship towards a more central place. Which is to say, black Americans, Frederick Douglass perhaps most famously among them, but by the tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands take their sovereign rights into their own hands in the way they act in the war, in enlisting, in their agitation, in their meetings and their AME church. Douglass is part of a broader movement of black liberation and self-determination.

DAVID BLIGHT:

He surely was, although it is true that the American abolition movement was biracial. Douglass actually learned a great deal from Garrison and the Garrisonians, both in technique and strategy and a lot of other things. And he had tremendous respect for many of his fellow white abolitionists. He also had terrible rivalries and breakups with some of them too. There's no fight like an internal fight.

CHRIS HAYES:

Oh God, the factional fights are insane.

DAVID BLIGHT:

It's like the old argument, there's no fight like a fight between two Marxists. Well, there's no fight like a fight between two radical reformers, they're always going to disagree. And then after the war, he has terrible rivalries with the next generation of black leaders, and that's sometimes it's really just personal, they want to knock him off. Anyway, but yeah, it's... But abolition is the prototypical American reform movement, radical reform movement. Everything that's happened since, in women's rights, you name it, right down, down the line, the labor movement, on and on and on, have always been modeling this antebellum movement against a system and an institution that frankly almost nobody thought they'd ever live to see ended. The great fact in the middle of all that, of course, is that it took this massive war and 700,000 lives to actually end it. And Douglass had so much to say about that too, brilliantly, about what it meant that slavery had only ended in this country through tremendous violence.

CHRIS HAYES:

What is his reaction to Lincoln's death?

DAVID BLIGHT:

Well, it's amazing. Actually, it's fascinating. By that time, by the spring of '65, he had come to know Lincoln from meeting him three times, twice at the White House in the Oval Office, two really fascinating pivotal meetings, especially the second one in August of 1864, where Lincoln actually invited Douglass to the White House, elicited his advice, his help, and so on. When Lincoln believed he was not going to be reelected that fall. The last one being right after the second inaugural in the East Room of the White House. So by then Lincoln and Douglass, although they started out at very different places, had actually come almost to speak from the same script. If you read the second inaugural, maybe the greatest speech by an American president, certainly one of the shortest, but you read the second inaugural, it's essentially the use of that same apocalyptic language. And it promises that every drop of blood shed by the lash shall be paid by bloodshed by the sword. Now I'm convinced, and Douglass was in the audience that day, he was right down to Lincoln's left, about 11 or 12 rows out. He was right there and he heard him. And I'm convinced, I can't prove it, but I'm convinced that Douglass had wished he could have written that speech for Lincoln. However, that Lincoln wrote it made it all the more important.

So when Lincoln is killed, especially given the moment, the war has just ended, the surrender has just happened in Appomattox four days before, the death of Lincoln and the portents now of possible continued fighting and division was terrifying. And Douglass was on the road giving a speech as always, he head back to Rochester, and there was a huge gathering of people as there were in towns all over the country, when they got the news of Lincoln's death, and Douglass was in the audience, they called on him, they yelled out, ""Douglass, come speak."" And he went up, and it's not clear he had any notes for this, but we do have a text written down later, he got up and made this deeply moving short speech to his neighbors really, his fellow Rochesterites, saying that he had never felt such a ""kinship"" with his countrymen as he did that night.

Kinship, that's an interesting word, that somehow in Lincoln's death at the end of this war, and the prospects now for black freedom, made him feel like kin folk with his countrymen, what he does with Lincoln, the rest of his life, for the next 30 years is fascinating because he basically invented about three different kinds of Lincolns depending on the audience, which is what everybody does with Lincoln. You want Lincoln to be this, you create that Lincoln. You want Lincoln to support that, you create that Lincoln, and Douglass was extremely adept at doing that depending on what the audience was.

CHRIS HAYES:

The death of Lincoln leads to Johnson's disastrous rain, his impeachment, and then a horrible white supremacist terrorism and violence in the South under presidential reconstruction, which is then supplanted by congressional reconstruction in the form of the Vanguard of radical Republicans, Grant's presidency and military occupation of the South, and an attempt at, the real first attempt, and which in some ways has never been rivaled since, of genuine, full and equal multiracial democracy. And talk a little bit about Douglass’ role in the Republican Party increasingly, and in reconstruction as a project and his theorizing of what this new version of American Democracy looks like.

DAVID BLIGHT:

Well, great question. A huge story, but a great question. And will go right to the core of his most hopeful moment. In many ways, his most sanguine moment it's 1868 and '69. He wrote a speech called The Composite Nation. And the text we have of that comes from 1869. He gave it a number of times. But this speech, this amazing speech is Douglass at the high point, this is the moment when reconstruction has succeeded. 13th Amendment, 14th Amendment's been passed and ratified, the 15th amendment has just been passed, it's not quite ratified, but soon to be. The radical Republican regimes are all being put in place in the South. And even by 69 Grant administration is about to move against the KU Klux Klan, all those terrible terror and violence practiced in '68.

But at this point, Douglass becomes such a proponent of this new America. The new America invented out of the civil war and the second constitution, the second Republic, it's almost like he feels himself the founder of the second Republic, and in this speech Composite Nation, he does many things, but one of the arguments he makes is that the United States ought to now export its ideology. He becomes a soft imperialist. He says we should be exporting this new equality to the Caribbean, to Latin America, to other places in the world, overnight, and he wasn't alone in that. A lot of other abolitionists began to think that too. America now has a chance, he says in that speech, to do something, no people have ever done. To create a nation that is multiethnic, multiracial, multireligious all living with a quality before law.

And then in the middle of the speech, he makes this robust case for Chinese immigration, which is just then becoming a big issue out in the West. The first Chinese Exclusion Act doesn't come till 1874, but it's already brewing. The huge Chinese Exclusion Act will come later in 1882, I think, but in the middle of the speech, he makes this amazing case for this multicultural America, this level of pluralism no people have ever attempted. And he says, ""Look Americans, get ready. They're coming. And Chinese civilization is 3,000 years old. Yes, they speak a strange language. Yes, they have strange religions, but they will assimilate.""

He has a model. His theory is classic assimilationism. He says, ""Look like all these other peoples who've come here, including black people, they will assimilate to our creeds. They will bring their genius, they will bring their knowledge of science, they will bring all of it."" And if you read that speech today, I swear, it sounds like either a multiculturalism manifesto of the 1990s, or it sounds like a diversity statement of universities today, and better that speech could be given now to some entering freshmen class at a university, and what sounded like it had just been written. So at that moment he has this tremendous hope, but Chris here's the thing, after 1870, I can't find any example of him giving it anywhere, because of what happens to reconstruction. He puts it away.

CHRIS HAYES:

And obviously by the time he's in the end of his life, he's watching the end of this project, essentially lynching Klan terrorism, and the reinstitution of white supremacy and apartheid in the South, the totalitarian system of racial oppression. But the vision he has, I want to end here because that note of the reason people should read the book, or spend some time even reading Douglass’ writing is because he is, to me, the most potent prophetic theorist of true American pluralism in a timeless fashion. That is still an articulation of the project that we're all working towards so fitfully and haltingly, and with such great difficulty in the year 2020, and with Donald Trump as president, but it's there, the ingredients are there, the vision are there, the vision for what it would mean for all of us to actually be full and equal citizens, no matter what color of our skin, no matter who we worship, no matter who we are in our identity in many other ways, even ways that he couldn't have conceived of at the time. The theoretical structure for that vision of America is there in Douglass back then.

DAVID BLIGHT:

It is, and it goes through, obviously, its great ups and its great downs. It came from in him in experience that made him at times both love and hate his country. He loved the creeds, said it a thousand times, equality, the popular sovereignty, Republican form of government, the right of revolution, et cetera. Some have argued he made even too much of a case for the power of the vote at the expense of economic rights, and there's some truth to that. Douglass was a much better political thinker than he was an economic thinker. But it comes from a place of great defeat at times, but also great victory at other times. And we often use this term, pluralism, don't we? Just loosely, or multiculturalism, we use it so loosely that we don't even know what it means anymore. Well, Douglass knew what it meant.

It meant the dream put into reality that people of every kind of creed, every kind of race background, ethnicity difference, even though they're going to fight it out, they're going to fight like hell over resources, and meaning, and religion, and interpretation. They're going to fight like hell, but it's possible to create a democracy in which all of them can actually live. And he never completely gave up on that, even in the face of lynching, that last great speech of his life called Lessons Of The Hour. It's amazing. He's an old man of 75 with trembling hands, but he goes out on the road dozens of times, in 1894, 76 by then, giving the speech, which is really an analysis, a really analytical treatment of why lynching was happening, and yet still at the end of that, he says you can kill us, you can Lynch people, but you cannot kill these elements of natural law. They will be sustained. They will live through it.

Now I'm not just saying that because you go to Douglass for some hope, because that's not what you'll always find, but he is an example of a prophetic voice who never gave up on this idea. And think about the monument stuff now, just to end on that, where you began, good Lord, how are we going to replace this Memorial landscape. I have a piece actually coming out tomorrow in the New York times with some recommendations about this. If the Confederate landscape is coming down, and it appears most of it is, and Christopher Columbus and so on and so on, we don't know how far this is going to go, but how do we harness this energy now, what new Memorial landscape might this country imagine out of our pluralism? It's an amazing opportunity, if you think about it, for artists, and curators, and historians, and creative people. And I think the Biden campaign should get behind it instead of leading from the back. I think they should take hold of this and try to help Americans imagine how to create a new Memorial landscape, not just about heroes, but maybe about ideas.

CHRIS HAYES:

David Blight is a professor of American History and director of the Gilder Lehrman Center of the study of slavery resistance and abolition in Yale University. The book we were just discussing ""Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom."" It's an incredible piece of work, and I really, really recommend you pick it up. And David, that was wonderful, thank you so much.

DAVID BLIGHT:

You bet. Thank you, Chris.

CHRIS HAYES:

Once again, my thanks to David Blight. You really should pick up that book. And if you don’t pick it up, just Google some Frederick Douglass speeches. Literally put that search term in. It’s worth it. They’re remarkable texts. We love to hear from you. Tweet us at the #WITHpod. Email WITHpod@gmail.com.

If you are an active, responsible citizen who is justice minded in a society that is deeply unequal and unjust, then you should have enough.

CHRIS HAYES:

Hello, welcome to ""Why is This Happening?"" with me, your host, Chris Hayes, back here in the quarantine closet for yet another week here on with pod. Today is June 19th, also known as Juneteenth, which is not a national holiday, although I would be willing to bet that it will be soon, if things go the way they're going right now and on this Juneteenth, we're in the midst of I think one of the most remarkable moments of racial reckoning the country's had in my adult lifetime, you've had the longest and most widespread sustained protest for racial equity and against police brutality and for racial justice that I've ever seen in my lifetime, the crowds that have been in the streets have been coming out despite a pandemic, which has been nerve wracking for many, including myself. Although a lot of them have been masked, early reports seem to indicate that the testing shows that there hasn't been a super spreader event so far as we know, but of course they've been on the streets in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, and there's these intersecting crises in the country.

There is of course the pandemic and the health crisis, which has, as we get more and more data, disproportionately affected black and brown Americans, particularly African Americans, as well as indigenous communities. The data on this is just pretty nuts in terms of death rates, infection rates, hospitalization rates, how much it's decimated black America. If you look at a city like Montgomery, Alabama, 90 percent of the folks that are hospitalized there are African American. We've got an economic crisis that's born of the pandemic and the efforts to fight it, which has also disproportionately fallen on the bottom quarter of workers, essentially, which is another category of Americans that's disproportionately black and brown. And then of course we have the crisis of police brutality, which of course is inextricably bound up with race.

All of these things are happening at the same time, all of them kind of like sinking the ax wedge into the central cleavage in American history and cracking open a lot. And there's also, of course, the person at the top, Donald Trump, who, as I'm speaking to you today, is preparing a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, who is a bigot and probably the most openly flagrantly racist president that we've had since maybe Woodrow Wilson, I would say. I think that's probably fair.

So all of this is happening the same time and I thought I really wanted to speak to someone who has been fighting a legal battle on many of these fronts, but is also one of the wisest and most searing thinkers and critics on racial hegemony, racial justice and the rule of law in an America that has been so tainted and poisoned by racism. Sherrilyn Ifill, who's the head of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and who has been a frequent guest on our program, luckily, and it's great to have you Sherrilyn, how are you?

SHERRILYN IFILL:

I'm doing well. How are you, Chris?

CHRIS HAYES:

I'm good. I thought maybe we'd start with Juneteenth. And I'm curious to hear your thoughts, reflections on the... It is striking to me that there are so many directions the energy and the streets have gone in the wake of George Floyd's murder towards demands for police accountability, the demands for police reform, demands for changes to budgets, to statues being pulled down, to companies giving people Juneteenth off. It's interesting to watch the forcing mechanism of public agitation, activism, organizing movement be channeled through the different institutions of American life and find ourselves at this Juneteenth that I think is being highlighted and celebrated in a way that has never happened in white America in my lifetime.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

I think that's true. I'm not sure that Juneteenth has ever been as celebrated in the black community as it is this year. It really has just taken hold and has become a kind of a rallying moment after these weeks and weeks of protest. I'm wary of the things that are offered in this moment to quickly, folks giving their employees Juneteenth off. There are real demands that go to structural racism in this country, and I think it's great to acknowledge and support our people in recognizing this important holiday, in part because returning us back to the centrality of our history of slavery and the delayed promise of emancipation seems the absolutely right message that needs to be sent and that we need to be talking about at this moment, but we also need to leave with some real structural change that will transform the injustices that we've been seeing in this moment. And so I just hope that everyone understands that the symbolic gestures actually are important, but they do not end the conversation.

CHRIS HAYES:

Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about this symbolism versus structural reform and the ways in which... The American conversation on this or the American political discourse on this tends to get pulled towards symbols very quickly, partly because I think we're such a self-mythologizing people. I don't think it's the case that Swedes go around being like, Because we are so self-mythologizing, the conversations do get pulled in both symbolic and very inner psychological ways, and I worry they do get pulled away from the basic material facts, which is that decade after decade, the disparities between black and white America have not gotten better and you can tick through every single statistic from health to wealth to incarceration, and they are right there in front of your face. And that's the core of the problem.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

That's right. And what are you going to do about that? What is your role in addressing that? And so I just want to make sure that... Juneteenth is something that I think also it is precious and special to our community and we need the space to be able to have these moments of uplift and recognition. And so I don't in any way mean to minimize that, but I do mean to say to the broader institutional actors in white America, who claim they want to try to do something in this moment that the something that they do has to be addressed to the, as you say, glaring and ongoing and very real and serious problems that are created out of institutional practices and policies.

What are you prepared to dismantle, is my question. What are you prepared to build? And I think every... And I say this to my own profession, I say this to the legal profession, what are you prepared to dismantle and prepare to build? I think it's great if a law firm gives their staff Juneteenth off, but I'd actually like to know in their practice, in their engagement with their clients and in their work, what do they intend to do that will address these glaring inequalities that can't be sustained in this country?

CHRIS HAYES:

Well, that question, which haunts all of this conversation, I think the sheer scope of that question is partly what sends people retreating back into symbolism and psychology.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

True, true.

CHRIS HAYES:

It's like, ""Well, what can I do?"" And it's like, ""Well, I can go to a march and I can hang this Black Lives Matter sign, and I can maybe make this contribution because the vastness of a crude history and racial hegemony in this country is just so overwhelming in its scope and in its effects that it feels that you're stabbing a dragon with a toothpick, if you do anything.

And I would get this question when I wrote my last book, what should I do? And I would say all the time, you can get involved in local prosecutors races, you can show up in your school board meeting, you can be the white person in the room who was like, ""Yes, we should desegregate our schools."" Or you should be the person at the zoning meeting who is like, ""Yes, we should build better housing for women seeking shelter in our neighborhood. Those are the things to me. But again, they still seem small, right? So then the question is, what are you prepared to build and what are you prepared to dismantle? What is the right, if there is a right answer, what's the answer to that?

SHERRILYN IFILL:

Well, it all depends. It's so funny because I do get asked that question all the time. And I actually think increasingly that it's a way of putting the work back on me. I just don't accept, you know?

CHRIS HAYES:

Right.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

I just don't accept that some captain of industry or someone who runs a theater or a business, or is a movie director, or doesn't know or at least couldn't know if they did some work, what might be the ways in which they could contribute to addressing this problem? And so instead, people ask me incessantly, what's the plan? What's the strategy? What's the website? Okay, well, I'm here. I've been doing this work forever. And you can go to my website. No, I don't mean that. I mean, I-No, no, I-... I try to be helpful, but I do think in a way, there is a sense in which the responsibility for figuring out how you as a citizen, especially as a leader in our society, the responsibility of figuring out how you contribute to making this democracy equal and just, that that is my responsibility to explain to you, I think it's actually the first problem with citizenship in this country. But what you described as a small thing is not a small thing. I've been challenging people.

CHRIS HAYES:

Yeah, [inaudible]

SHERRILYN IFILL:

I've been challenged to know every race on the ballot this year, that when you walk into the polling place in November, or if we're doing an election this summer, a special election, that you actually know why you're voting for the school board candidate that you're voting for... why you're voting for the school board candidate that you're voting for.

CHRIS HAYES:

That's great.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

Did you actually know why you would pick that sheriff candidate over that sheriff candidate? Did you why, when it says pick three judges, which are the three judges you would pick and why? And that's actually not a small thing. It's a lot of work.

CHRIS HAYES:

No.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

It's a work that most people don't do.

CHRIS HAYES:

No, and again, that is in the ballpark of what my answer, which is about how you are as a local citizen in your local world, because, the upsetting truth is that there are big macro trends in federal policy that have enforced segregation and oppression and disparate impact, but there's a million small town meetings and community board meetings where people are saying yes or no about whatever someone's going to build this thing, or your kids are going to go to this school, where lots of people with quote unquote good politics, are like, ""Well, obviously I believe in desegregation, but I just think this is an unworkable plan, because then the kids are going to have..."" And don't be that person. That's one affirmative way to do it.

CHRIS HAYES:

But then I think, what ends up happening, again with the conversation is symbolism, and then there's this whole psychological aspect of allyship and whiteness and all this stuff, and I don't know if it's just the repressed Irish Catholic in me who's just like, ""I just don't want to hear..."" Just go to the school board meeting and be the voice for desegregation in your school board and then just save everything else about how you feel about it all.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

Yeah. I do think also that when people become awakened to the issues of injustice and race, very often people feel overwhelmed, and so what they're looking for when they ask you what to do is the thing that will solve it and take the knot out of their stomach, but there's a knot in my stomach every day and has been since I was 22 years old, so I don't know how to take the knot out of your stomach and that's not my job, and actually, if you are an active, responsible citizen who is justice minded in a society that is deeply unequal and unjust, then you should have enough.

CHRIS HAYES:

You're going to have a knot in your stomach. That is the price.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

I can't help you with that.

CHRIS HAYES:

It's the price of consciousness.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

That's exactly right, and people want me to make them feel better, and the only thing I can make them feel better about is that progress is being made and has been made, but that the work is deep and slow and painstaking and has to be consistent, and that the good news for them is that there are people who do this work 24 hours a day, like the staff of the legal defense fund, and I'm not asking everyone to be a 24 hour a day, civil rights lawyer, or a 24 hour a day, civil rights activists like the movement for black lives. I'm not saying that, but what I am saying is that to be a citizen of a country in which you take responsibility for your citizenship means that, as you say, you have to be conscious and you have to figure out what is your part, what is your role? And I hope that out of this moment comes a stronger sense of that, that the citizenship that most of us have been exercising is simply inadequate to the needs of this country.

CHRIS HAYES:

You just said something about progress that I think is interesting, and I've been thinking a lot about in the context of criminal justice and policing, because there are two stories that I can tell myself about that, about race and mass incarceration and policing in America. One is kind of a hopeful story because the incarceration rate in America is actually declining. The country is actually decarcerating. The decarceration is happening actually fairly quickly in certain parts of the country. The political movement to decarcerate the country is strong and winning a lot of victories. It's won a lot of unexpected victories at the local level. It's channeled energy in the last four or five years into these prosecutor's races, which no one was talking about. No one in the universe was organizing around prosecutor's races seven or eight years ago, as far as I can tell.

CHRIS HAYES:

It has sort of sees people. Obviously local leaders have, but a kind of idea of a national grassroots movement, so there's all these ways in which there's been progress. And then at the same time there's been progress, you can also just tell a story of, we're seeing the same shit. It's the same videos and it's the same police and people's experience of the police, and go talk to black residents on the Southwest side of Chicago and say, ""Is it different under Lori Lightfoot, the out black female mayor of Chicago, than Richard Daley?"" ""I don't know, man."" Those two facts about progress or lack thereof are battling in my mind at all times.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

Yeah. I think though that I'm hardwired to see progress, but I also see those issues that have resulted in retrenchment. So I just accept that that is a cycle, and that's why the fight has to be consistent. If I take just the last five years, the officer who we watched take the breath of Eric Garner was never indicted and was only fired from the New York police department last August.

CHRIS HAYES:

Five years later.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

Yeah. So if I compare that to Minneapolis where all four officers were fired immediately and officer Chauvin was charged and the other's charged as well, or if I take that to Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta, and because I've seen this issue my whole lifetime, I've never seen anything like this. I've never seen the quick and almost immediate understanding that something had to happen to those officers. Now, the story's not finished, because I don't know if these offices get convicted of anything. I understand that, but that's not a small thing and so that's one piece, but the second piece is even almost more important, which is where the conversation starts today as compared to where it started five years ago, and this is where you see the Republicans are playing a rear guard game.

CHRIS HAYES:

It is amazing, isn't it?

SHERRILYN IFILL:

And the train has already left the station. Senator Scott, with all due respect, we're really not talking about training anymore, okay? Not that training's not important. Not that we don't want data collection. I'm a lawyer, so I always want the data, but we are on accountability now and we're serious about it, and so the fact that the conversation now is about police budgets and is about union contracts, these were issues. We couldn't get any traction years ago. We started examining police union contracts four years ago. I started talking about re-imagining public safety in 2015.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

So honestly the fact that that's where the conversation is started, that's the core of the conversation this time, it's almost more important than anything else because it tells us that we have now moved past the, ""Do you think he really meant to do it? Or, ""Is he really racist?"" I can't tell you how many man hours I spent in interviews with people asking me those kinds of questions, and so I think moving the conversation to a place where people understand something has to be done and that there must be accountability, I think about police unions who routinely immediately, no matter what the video looked like, protected their own. I think about the way the union responded to the video of Eric Garner being killed and the way unions all over are responding to the video of officer Chauvin, even the PBA called it murder. That's not what they did.

CHRIS HAYES:

That's such a good point.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

Everybody knows something's going to happen, and now they're trying to figure out how they can minimize what it is.

CHRIS HAYES:

It's funny you talk about the rear guard, because I think it's a great point. I came into adult political writing in the era of 9/11, and so I know what a defensive crouch on an issue looks like, because it was basically Democrats on everything and Democrats and large parts of the left on everything having to do with the war, peace and terror, and when you got that defensive...A politician who's like, ""Oh Jesus, I got to deal with this somehow. This is not in my wheelhouse, but I'm going to try to swing at it,"" that's the way the Republican party looks on all this stuff right now, In a way, that is really wild to me because I will be the first to admit, and I was texting with a whole bunch of people, black and white, when the uprising and the street protest and the burning down of the third precinct happened. And there was this thing in me of like, ""Oh man, white backlash is a powerful force in American politics. It got us Trump. I was scared the demons would be unleashed,"" and it just never showed up, and I think it has people... It's wild. It's wild what's happened to public opinion.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

As I said, they're reading the polls too. That's why Trump tried to do that little pageant in the Rose garden that was utterly meaningless. They understand that they don't have the American public with them on this. That video of officer Chauvin killing George Floyd is so devastating and so overwhelming, even to those of us who do this work and have seen far too many videos, and I think these are moments that things shift, and people said, ""Where did this all come from?"" It's not unrelated to what started in 2014. Movements build. Just because it doesn't produce the same result after Eric Garner was killed or after Akai Gurley he was killed in New York, after Mike Brown was killed in Ferguson, just because Baltimore didn't produce a 50 state uprising after Freddie Gray was killed, just because seeing Walter Scott killed in that park and chased and shot like that didn't have the same effect, doesn't mean that when we back to back see Ahmaud Arbery chased by these three vigilantes and killed, and then see George Floyd killed that way, that they're not all connected, but it's enough is enough, and then you take, it's true that you take a hundred thousand people dead, many of them black and brown, you take the COVID pandemic, the president's terrible response, the almost systematic abuse of those daily press conferences that the president would have about... I really feel like that we were suffering under that, so I think that's all of a piece, that when you see this movement, it's like people have had it.

CHRIS HAYES:

Enough.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

Enough.

CHRIS HAYES:

The point about movements, I think, is so-

CHRIS HAYES:

So the point about movement, I think is so important. The metaphor I've used before is that it's not, social change is not like painting a fence where you know exactly how much you've painted and how much you have left to paint. It's like when you're prying a lid off a jar and you're there, like, ""Oh, will you try it? Will you try it?"" And it doesn't move. And then boom! It pops off. You're like, ""Oh wow. The whole time, all that effort was doing something. It was loosening the jar."" But you don't predict when it pops off. And that's, I think these moments are unpredictable for that reason. But I do think that you can look back at all the effort and we've interviewed a lot of people.

CHRIS HAYES:

We've interviewed a lot of people who have been sort of instrumental in that. You feel that way? Right? All of the effort, when you talk about working 24 hours a day on this, which you do and what your staff does, it does feel like there's a relationship between that work and these moments.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

Oh, yeah. The thing is you don't know when the moment's coming, but when it comes, you have to be ready to ride it, which is why, LDF is working on policing issues forever. Thurgood Marshall was working on them. We litigated Tennessee vs Garner on behalf of the father of the 15 year old that was shot in the back by Memphis police officers as he tried to run away and climb over a fence. And that's the case from which the Supreme Court really developed the doctrine of whether officers can shoot a fleeing suspect.

CHRIS HAYES:

Wait, just to put a light on that, that case is the case where, for the first time, the Supreme Court says, ""No, police cannot shoot a fleeing suspect.""

SHERRILYN IFILL:

That is correct. That is correct. But what they say is unless the suspect is a threat to them or a threat to others. And then the subsequent case says it has to be a reasonable test. A reasonable officer has to think that. Now, of course, that is, as I have said before, packed in with notions of race and who constitutes a threat and who doesn't constitute a threat. But the point is that we've been doing this work forever, and ever, and ever. And moments come where there's a wave and you have to ride it. That's what you wait for.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

And the wave comes because of grassroots activism, because of people on the ground saying, ""Enough."" So we have to credit the activists who have stuck with this so that they could really just be ready at that moment. It's not like we were all saying, ""Oh my gosh, this terrible video has happened."" What should we be saying about policing? We've been working on it, even when there've been no videos. And that allows people to move in that moment. And then there's tremendous pressure of just knowing. You know that the moment, the wave won't last forever, but you know that you have to get as much out of it as you can. And so how do you sustain it and how do you get concrete things out of it? It's really important.

CHRIS HAYES:

You've done a lot of work on voting rights. And I wanted to talk to you a little bit. I want to talk about rights because, right now, to me, that's basically the big disaster scenario, which I feel like we're watching happen in slow motion in the same way I felt like we were watching the pandemic disaster happen in slow motion for weeks as I watched it. And then said, ""Guys, guys, this is going to be a disaster."" But before we're going to get that, I want to talk about how you understand representation and Black political power in this country at a moment like this, because it is striking to me that when you look at those disparities that I was talking about before, the one place where there has been real marked progress is Black elected officials serving in representative governments.

CHRIS HAYES:

And at all different levels, there really is an enormous spike that happens, post Civil Rights and Voting Rights Act. And you've got these cities like New Orleans and Atlanta crucially, where Rayshard Brooks was killed, that are, there's a lot of Black political power. And yet that power is still enmeshed in the institutional prerogatives of the city and the police department. And I'm just curious when you look at Washington D.C. and the way the cops dealt with protesters there, or you look at Atlanta or New Orleans, how you think about what Black political power means in the context of these places?

SHERRILYN IFILL:

Well, this is really an important question, Chris. And obviously, I've spent so much time in or near Baltimore. And when Freddie Gray was killed, we had a Black mayor, a Black comptroller, a Black police chief, a Black district attorney, Black city council president. So lots of Black electoral success. And I guess what I would say is when I was a first and a young LDF lawyer, so this is 25 or so years ago, I was being really supervised and mentored by Lani Guinier, the great Civil Rights scholar and who had herself been a Voting Rights litigator at LDF. And she really taught me so much about Voting Rights litigation. And she wrote some wonderful scholarship over the years for which Republicans excoriated her years later when she was nominated to head the Civil Rights division and President Clinton ultimately caved and withdrew her nomination.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

But one of the things that I love about her scholarship is that she leaned right into this question and she wrote a piece about Black electoral success and how that had become a shorthand for the success of the Voting Rights movement and the Civil Rights movement. But what she reminds us is that those who were fighting for Black political participation, for the ability participate in the political process, the Fannie Lou Hamers, and Unita Blackwells. And John Lewises, and all of those people in SNCC, but really, especially the people in the south who risked their lives and their livelihoods to be part of that Voting Rights movement at a time it was very, very dangerous for them and their families. They did it because they believed that unlocking political power was the way to change the material conditions of their lives.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

They didn't do it so they could count up how many Black people were running the city, or so they could say, ""This is the first Black mayor."" They believed that Black political power was the key to unlocking change in the material conditions of their life. Thurgood Marshall, the first director counsel of the Legal Defense Fund, our founder, when he talked about his most important cases, always talked about Smith versus Allwright. Everyone expects him just to talk about Brown, but Smith versus Allwright, was the case that he won four years after the Legal Defense Fund was created in 1944.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

And it was a case that he won in which the Supreme Court agreed with his position and struck down the practice of the all White primary in the south. So in the south, it was then controlled only by one party, the Democrats. And they would hold Whites only primaries because the primary election decided everything. So whoever won the primary was the winner. And they took the position that, ""The party is not actually the state, it's like our own private thing. So we could whatever we want and exclude whoever we want and we choose to exclude Black people."" And we had to litigate that case all the way up to the Supreme Court. And in 1944, Thurgood Marshall wins that case. And it's the one people skip over. So when I talk about how long we've been at challenging voter suppression, it's back to 1944, right? So that case is so powerful and so important that it begins to open up the political power. And Marshall cites it as one of his most important cases because he believed as well that Black political power, unlocking the key to the Black vote was so key to Black people having autonomy and control over their lives and communities.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

And sometimes I think we have forgotten that. We get very excited about the first this and the first that. And that's great, and it's important to hit those milestones. But what I'm hoping where we're entering into, Chris, is a time of real accountability. And what is it that we expect of the people that we elect, actually of any race? But certainly when we talk about what Black political power means. And I think the move around progressive district attorneys is part of that, where people start to lean into what is the power of this office and how are you going to use the power of that office to be transformative for our communities?

SHERRILYN IFILL:

And I think to the extent we've stopped asking that question or stopped making that demand, then it becomes really problematic. And then you have this figure that looks like success, but you don't have the transformation that connects with it. And then the second thing, of course, is even Black political leaders who are trying their very best, who are committed, are operating within a system that they don't have the full power to dismantle. And so they are inheriting structures and ways of doing things and economic systems. And they're trying to throw elbows and work for their community within that larger structural system. And that's where our allies need to come in and be clear about the structural system that may be working for them, but that ultimately is unjust.

CHRIS HAYES:

You've been doing a lot on voting rights. The LDF has been litigating on that for a long time. And I want to talk about where that battle is right now here in 2020, when it's, I think as important as it's ever been right after we take this quick break.

CHRIS HAYES:

Your organization has been fighting against efforts to restrict and suppress the vote for decades. We have seen all kinds of different incarnations of it throughout the years, throughout American history, since basically Reconstruction. It's taken many different forms recently. And then now we've got this added craziness, which is the pandemic, which is the fact that craziness, which is the pandemic, which is the fact that people are worried about their safety. We don't know what it's going to look like, particularly in the fall. We've seen two elections that were kind of disasters, one in Wisconsin, one in Georgia. How are you thinking about voting rights and access to the franchise amidst this pandemic in this moment?

SHERRILYN IFILL:

I got to tell you that for us Wisconsin was a game changer. That was just such a failure. And to see that black voters in particular, who were suffering such terrible catastrophic rates of infection, and hospitalization, and death from COVID failed by the state legislature, the governor made a valiant attempt to postpone the primary, failed by the state Supreme Court, and then ultimately failed by the United States Supreme Court, who refused to uphold the very modest adjustment that a federal district court made to the date when absentee ballots could return.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

And then watching just folks standing on those lines with masks on trying to participate and exercise their right to vote, knowing that they were risking their health and lives... I just can't express to you what was steeled in me seeing that.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

And our staff really just went to work. And so we filed case after case: Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina. We have a hearing in Louisiana, in fact this next week, challenging absentee ballot restrictions that make it difficult for people to cast absentee ballots, and make it difficult for those absentee ballots to be counted.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

Many black voters are actually reticent about voting absentee because our ballots are most often regarded as spoiled, that is not counted because there's some deficiency in them.

CHRIS HAYES:

Right.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

But the deficiencies are largely because of these crazy rules; in Alabama to file an absentee ballot, you have to file the absentee ballot and have the signature of two third party witnesses, or have it notarized.

CHRIS HAYES:

Come on!

SHERRILYN IFILL:

And, I'm sorry, and send it in with a copy of your government-issued photo ID. And we have the Secretary of State of Alabama who just admitted, who said, ""Well, they just have to go to Kinko's or something.""

SHERRILYN IFILL:

So here we are in a pandemic, you have elderly black people, we have black people suffering from emphysema, from lupus, from preexisting conditions, and you're telling them they have to interact with two people to get to witness signatures, or you're telling them they got to go find a notary. And you're telling them that unless they have a means of copying their government-issued photo ID in their home, they should go to Kinko's. It's insane. And so-

CHRIS HAYES:

Wait a second. But this is my favorite part of this, or my least favorite part, you filed the suit, am I crazy that the department of justice, for no reason-

SHERRILYN IFILL:

Yeah.

CHRIS HAYES:

Fought, like literally it has nothing to with them-

SHERRILYN IFILL:

We're not in litigation.

CHRIS HAYES:

They're not in the litigation.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

No, they just wanted the court to know. That they don't think [crosstalk 00:03:05]-

CHRIS HAYES:

Right, tell what did Barr's DOJ do-

SHERRILYN IFILL:

So they filed what they've done in a number of cases in which they've had no role. Let me just give you a little bit of the backup. They did this in Chicago, when the State of Illinois sued the City of Chicago police department, and they were preparing to negotiate and complete the filing of that consent decree, the Department of Justice, then under Sessions, filed a statement of interest saying they didn't think this consent decree was necessary. They weren't in the litigation. This is between the State of Illinois-

CHRIS HAYES:

So wild.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

... and the City of Chicago.Harvard Affirmative Action Case, government is not a party, once again they filed a statement of interest wanting to let the judge know that they think that the Affirmative Action Program at Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

And so, yeah, they filed a statement of interest to let the court know that even though they're not a party in the case, they want to weigh in on the side... Just imagine who you are as the Department of Justice, think about the history of the Department of Justice in the civil rights movement, weighing in the side of the state that has the most notorious record of voter suppression, that is the cradle of where the voting rights movement was born and fought, the place where the Edmund Pettus Bridge is, that you weigh in on the side of Alabama to say, ""No, I don't think it's an unreasonable burden to expect black people and disabled voters to have to jump through all of these hoops to vote.""

SHERRILYN IFILL:

But that surely is what they did. Fortunately we prevailed anyway. And the Federal District Court said, ""Yeah, actually it is onerous, and they don't have to get these witness signatures."" And the court also said, because the Secretary of State also prohibited local jurisdictions that wanted to have drop-off boxes for absentee ballots, prohibited them from doing so. And the court also said that that also violated the law.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

And of course we can always count on the Secretary of State of Alabama to appeal the case. And so now it's in the 11th Circuit. We won in South Carolina where the court said, ""Yes, the witness requirement actually does impose a significant burden particularly on black voters who are trying to avoid COVID infection and death.""

SHERRILYN IFILL:

And then of course, as I said, we have a hearing in Louisiana in the coming week. So we'll have to re-up this. This is just for the primary elections, right? This is for the Alabama runoff, the Senate runoff, that Sessions will be in, of course, the Louisiana primary that had been postponed. We'll have to do all of the full trial on all of this for November. It's really quite astonishing. I think so many people thought, ""Well, maybe there'll be something that pulls this country together."" Not even a global pandemic can whet the appetite..

CHRIS HAYES:

So one of the craziest things to me, Sherrilyn, about this moment in the kind of voting battles and voter suppression, voter access is that there's a kind of Frankenstein's monster quality to this. And here's what I mean by that. You have had the GOP for years now attempting to, at the margin, make it harder for people of color to vote and not just people of color, students, too, right? That there's this sort of two groups that they can fairly consistently know will not be voting for them in large numbers. And you've seen voter suppression efforts, voter ID, New Hampshire's Republican Party went through this totally insane thing with college students where they were doing everything in their power to stop the college students from voting. And all of it is really gross, offensive to representative democracy, but sort of cynically understandable. There are constituencies they think aren't going to vote for them. They don't want to have them vote.

CHRIS HAYES:

Now you've got this vote by mail assault that the president is leading, that has rallies of people in Michigan, conservatives burning their absentee ballot applications. Voting by mail, it's not like a polling location on a college campus where you can guess what the votes are going to be. Voting by mail is used by Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives alike. It's so insane to me they are undertaking this. I honestly think it could come back to really haunt them just as a pure... morality aside, a pure tactical play. What do you think?

SHERRILYN IFILL:

Well, I lead a nonpartisan organization and so I can't really comment on how this will fare for the Republicans. What I can say is if ever there was a sign that we are in something approaching a kind of national cult, it is the willingness of people to believe that methods of voting that have been used for years, that almost all our members of the military use, that business people use, that travelers use. Most people have used it sometime or another, somehow has taken on a partisan slant and is regarded as some kind of nefarious plot to harm Donald Trump. When in fact, the voters who most often vote absentee are Republicans, actually the figures. And yet it is whatever he says, well, might not work for him now has become tainted with some, or become controversial.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

I can just tell you in my conversations with Facebook around the refusal to take down President Trump's two tweets, one about California and one about Michigan, both of which contain misinformation about absentee votes and both of which are voter suppressive. And the conversation was about absentee voting as a new and controversial method of voting. And I was just like, ""No, it's not. Where did you get that idea?"" Simply because Trump says it, it becomes something that now is controversial. It's like wearing a mask is now not a sign that you're trying to protect yourself against a deadly global pandemic, but a sign that you want to thumb your nose at the president.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

So this absentee ballot thing is crazy. And so we have been in this litigation in all of these states. We've been bringing the cases that we've been bringing on behalf of black voters and disabled voters who also should not be compelled to have to go out and have two witnesses sign their absentee ballot and get it notarized and get a copy of their government issued photo ID. The whole point is that they don't want to go out and they shouldn't have to go out.

CHRIS HAYES:

It's also one of these places where it's like, I have no idea. I literally don't know the answer to quote unquote which side it would benefit if we had everyone in the country voting by mail in the midst of a pandemic or everyone who wants to able to do that. But we should do that. I don't, I mean, maybe that would be, I don't know. Maybe [inaudible] at the Republican, I don't care. That is just a first principle belief. It's like everyone should be able to vote safely. That's it, I don't care. Let the chips fall where they may.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

But this is why I keep saying that I grow increasingly distressed by us talking about voter suppression in partisan terms. Because when we talk about whose votes are the low hanging fruit for suppression, we are almost always talking about black voters. So conveniently talking about this, using the overlay of Democrats and Republicans, annoys the hell out of me because when we talk about it in pure racial terms then you can see how terrible it is. And when you talk about it in partisan terms, people just say, ""Oh, well this partisan politics."" I just told you the story of Smith v. Allwright, in which it was the Democratic Party running the all white primaries in the south to hold onto power, to keep people from voting. So voters said that through line of voter suppression is racism. And when we talk about it in these partisan terms, we kind of lose how truly grotesque it is that there can be a faction of what constitutes a legitimate political party in this country that is trying to keep people from being able to exercise the franchise.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

These are the same people who then are upset when people are out protesting, they're upset when someone takes a knee. I mean, there's been almost no form of democratic expression that they approve of for black people when they are trying to improve their condition, protest against current conditions and so forth. So I just think we have to make sure that we don't lose in the conversation about Republicans and Democrats. And I'm not saying that the Republicans have not fully aligned themselves with voter suppression. I just want to be clear that whose votes are we talking about suppressing?

CHRIS HAYES:

No, the only way that, the way for that it's unavoidably partisan is that there's only one party that tries to do it, right? So it just is not the case. You would just never see a Democrat... it just is not a-

SHERRILYN IFILL:

Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, Chris, though, because I told you we have a hearing in Louisiana next week. The governor of Louisiana is a Democrat who we are suing about these absentee ballot provisions. So I-

CHRIS HAYES:

That's a good point.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

But there's no question that it is, for the most part, the Republicans who are doing this, but I just always hold out the possibility. I agree with what the real politic is in the moment, but it's just I've been at this long enough. One of my first voting rights cases was, that I participated in, I think it was the first case in which I did a direct examination at trial was Jeffers v. Clinton. It was an Arkansas voting rights case and who was the Clinton? So I just, over the arc of time, things may shift. And that's why I just think that while there's no question about what Republicans have done and how they have aligned themselves and how in many ways I think the Democrats have been valiant in their fight against voter suppression. The reality is, while we think about whose votes are being suppressed, this is at its core, a race issue, and we should never lose sight of that.

CHRIS HAYES:

Do you think, I mean, so to me, there's two issues that I worry about in terms of this election. So there's access, right? There's just making sure people can safely vote and that just basically people can safely vote. And then there's Election Day itself and legitimacy and questions of... and that to me is, I have, we were talking about a knot in your stomach before, this is a knot in my stomach because I think, A, it's clear, we've seen it in Wisconsin and Georgia that results will take a while. There's New York primary on Tuesday. My brother happens to be managing the campaign of a congressional candidate, Jamaal Bowman who's, who's challenging Eliot Engel, the incumbent Congressman in the district we grew up in, my brother and I.

CHRIS HAYES:

And we were talking about when they'll know. And they don't expect they're going to know who wins that night. It's probably going to be a bunch of days. There's a ton of absentee ballots to count. That's probably going to be the case in November. Very well could take them a bunch of time. And that's a lot of time for the president or anyone to sort of create mischief and to sort of call into question the legitimacy and I wonder if you share those concerns, if you think about that.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

I do. I do. I think this is going to be an election that it really will test us in this way. So it will test your colleagues, the media, right. I constantly say Decision 2020 and the show with theme music, that has nothing... That's not in the Constitution. That's just what it would be nice on the night of an election to have show where everybody stays up and we know who the winner is because that's what we've gotten used to. But it's not necessary. Well that's why it's great. We've had some dry runs. Listen, the world went on every day and it was quite calm. And we didn't know for more than a week who the mayor of Baltimore was. So we just had an election. Right. And the count started and it took a week. It took a week and it was kind of an upset, but life went on. People were not rioting in the streets. So I mean, so I do think that there are these dry runs that we should be using just like the election you're talking about in New York. This is an opportunity for us to educate the public of, ""This is okay."" Right. It doesn't mean that something nefarious has gone on. We're counting the votes. Every vote should be counted, right? We've encouraged people to vote absentee who don't want to risk COVID and therefore we should wait to count those votes.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

But we have to begin to inculcate that now, so that when someone tries to rile the public up into thinking of the mere fact that we don't know who the winner is on election night is a sign of something going wrong that that is in fact not true. And so we have to begin that preparation. But do we expect shenanigans from this president? I mean, this president put the S in shenanigans, this is what he does. And so we know that that's going to happen. So the fact that we know is what's supposed to prepare us, and there are a number of groups by the way, who are in scenario planning and in conversations about what this might look like. And, but the most important thing is that we prepare the public so the public is not freaking out. So we don't have the Brooks Brothers riot saying [inaudible] count. But you're right to be concerned and I am as well.

CHRIS HAYES:

I will say from my perch in the media, this was a big concern of mine. It was more of a concern of mine five months ago than it is now because of the dry run. So I think that the world of control rooms and decision desks now understand very well the timeline for this in this new world we're in. We've had a bunch of these. They understand, I think it's going to be communicated editorially in the production of the evening of election night an expectation set at the top that this is the nature of the new normal. And I think that... And it's going to be really important for everyone to do that and not to create, because then if you have this like, ""Well, this is weird. We're not getting... "" Remember what happened on the night of the Iowa Caucuses? Which again, if you had gone into the Iowa caucuses with the expectation it would take a while then, okay, fine. We'll find out who won the Iowa caucuses in five days. Who the F cares? No one's living or dying.But because it wasn't, and because well, they did screw up. There was an actual logistical screw up. And there were actual documented errors. It was real chaos. It felt it wobbled the legitimacy of the process. And so that, I do think the good news, I think is that that is ingrained now in us that we understand what we're going into. But it doesn't-

SHERRILYN IFILL:

But you've got to be talking about that weeks before the election. You've got to prepare the people to understand because it's also not fair to us. When they don't show up with the power cords for the voting machines and people wait for four hours in Gwinnett County, Georgia to vote and civil rights groups try to get election officials to hold the polls open later, right. Or in Harris County, Texas. Remember that night? Or just this last election in Georgia where people voted at midnight or in Nevada at 1:30 a.m. It's not helpful, right, if the media is saying, ""And the winner is.. ] So I really think that also to prepare the voters weeks in advance that this becomes the mantra and the drum beat of the media, I think is going to be really important so that people have a chance to vote because also people don't think it's worth it to stay in line til 1:00 in the morning if you all have called the winner at nine. So I just think that this is a job that has to be undertaken by voting rights activists and advocates, by responsible political parties and by the media to tamp down the expectations and to grow up as a democracy. I mean, we don't have to know that night. You've got a whole, what, how many months, until two months until inauguration. It's not like the change of power happens within 48 hours.

CHRIS HAYES:

And we've already seen, we already had that experience, the other place where we had that experience, which I think again, was a useful dry run on this is 2018 where there were seven, I want to say there were seven or eight House races in California called after election night. They came in over a long period of days. The Arizona Senate race which was quite close and a lot of mail in ballots, that got called three or four or five days afterwards. And again, that was just what it is.Now remember, the president did try to, there was this accusation thrown out by the president that because of the length of time they were quote unquote stealing it. But I also think, I don't know, the audience for his BS on that stuff, I think it is what it is.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

Yeah, that's right. That's exactly right.

CHRIS HAYES:

I don't think it has a broader, normally if the president came before the nation and said, ""They're stealing the election,"" it would be like, ""They're what?""

SHERRILYN IFILL:

I don't think he's grown in credibility, shall we say. I really don't, beyond his base. And so, but that doesn't mean that it's not dangerous because it's [inaudible] dangerous. And so that's the idea is, the fear is that he would say this precisely because he think he was losing and might want to, shall we say, arouse his base. And as we've seen over the last few weeks, what does he always say when he wants to arouse his base? What did he say this morning about how protesters would be treated? What did he say yesterday about the Supreme Court decisions? It's always they're going to take your Second Amendment rights. It's always a dog whistle to those who carry weapons.

CHRIS HAYES:

Yes. It's a very-

SHERRILYN IFILL:

Very alarming, yeah.

CHRIS HAYES:

And alarming and gross. And I thought I had the exact same reaction to the tweet yesterday, which was the Supreme Court decisions are a shotgun blast in our faces. And they're going to take your Second Amendment away. It's like, that's real close to just straight up incitement. They're shooting you, it's time to shoot back is essentially the semantic meaning of that.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

Yeah. So it's very, very alarming. So that's the kind of stuff I'm worried about him saying. And it's one of the reasons I worry so much about the refusal of Facebook to address the looters and shooters comment, for example, and to take seriously those kinds of remarks. The fact that they have an exception for politicians who post misinformation means that it's not only Trump that can be saying these things, but the local sheriff running to get reelected. Imagine a sheriff, a Sheriff Arpaio, right, who might say that there are undocumented people coming to steal the vote #secondamendment, right? It's going to be a very, very perilous time. And it's going to require a lot of discipline on the part of all of us to really be steady at the till to make sure that whatever the outcome, there is a sense of safety and a sense in which we expect everyone's vote to be counted.

CHRIS HAYES:

Well, luckily, one of the steadiest at the till people in public life is Sherrilyn Ifill, who I've had the good fortune to talk to today and on the show often. And I'm obviously a tremendous admirer. And thank you so much. You have such a busy schedule. I really appreciate you making time.

SHERRILYN IFILL:

Thank you, Chris. And I would be remiss if I didn't just thank you for your coverage of the COVID pandemic. You really rang the alarm early. You were kind of a Cassandra, and it was very moving to watch those programs, terrifying, but also moving and to just thank you for being willing to step out and do that was important.

CHRIS HAYES:

Thank you. Thanks. That means a lot.

Once again my great thanks to Sherrilyn Ifill, I think you can tell what a big admirer of her’s I am and have been for a very long time. She’s the president and director council of the NAACP legal defense fund.

Why Is This Happening? The fight for asylum with Bridget Cambria and Tobias Barrington Wolff: podcast and transcript,['Why Is This Happening'],"As the coronavirus pandemic spreads, we know that there are marginalized groups that are exposed. Those migrants seeking asylum at the southern border are one of those exposed groups, and face even more danger in part due to the Trump administration’s immigration policies. These are policies that are intended to close off the country and deter those who are lawfully seeking asylum.

This conversation with Bridget Cambria and Tobias Barrington Wolff about this administration’s policies and the case of a particular family that they represent was recorded prior to the heights of the pandemic that we now live in. It illustrates the hardships that asylum seekers face against a system that is actively working against them, and it is evidence of why they are now more vulnerable than ever.

Note: This is a rough transcript — please excuse any typos.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: These battles, they're not about the immigration process. This is about what rights do immigrants have? And the administration believes that an immigrant has no rights. No constitutional rights, no rights to even have a case heard in a court. This is about-are they human beings or are they individuals we can do whatever we want with?

CHRIS HAYES: Hello and welcome to ""Why is This Happening?"" with me, your host, Chris Hayes. If my voice sounds roomier today, which is the echo in the background, it's because I am not in a professional podcast studio as per usual. Instead, I am in a secret, remote location known as the COVID-19 den. Many of us are in that same situation. It's more than likely when you're listening to this in your ear holes that's where you find yourself. I hope everyone out there is staying safe as is practicable and not losing their minds and navigating the nine million different log-ins for their kid's distance learning, which was our morning this morning. Just setting up your five year-old's Zoom account and their Zearn account and their Kids A-Z account and their Google Classroom account.

Look, Tiffany and I have gone back and forth on this; about what the mission of this podcast is in this strange moment. I think we are probably going to start focusing more on coronavirus stuff, but we had some stuff we recorded before all this happened and today's, I think, is quite relevant because of the following: we know that the way this virus is moving through society, there are marginalized populations that are the most exposed to the risk. Homeless folks, people in homeless shelters, incarcerated people in prison and jails. We already have really gnarly stories about an outbreak in Rikers here in New York City and immigrants in detention, particularly in ICE detention facilities. ICE has been extremely stingy with data and slow to change their habits and practices and probably have succeeded in spreading the virus all around the country because they keep apprehending people and then funneling them through various different facilities around the U.S.

Today's conversation is about immigrants and it's actually about immigrants who don't even get into the U.S. because over the last year or so, the Trump administration has instituted a suite of policies that has, essentially ... I think the best way to think about it is turned Mexico into the wall. The wall isn't really there. They're not really building a wall. What they have done is they've turned the country of Mexico into America's wall. There's a policy called MPP, Migrant Protection protocols, which is deeply Orwellian because it does not protect migrants. In fact, it exposes them, as you'll hear in this conversation, to tremendous hardship and danger. And this has now been going on for tens of thousands of people and their plight takes on added acuity during this time because they are now subject to the spread of the virus and they have no protection. Many of them are living on the streets or they're in mass shelters.

So this is the story both how the Trump administration has gone about closing off the country to people seeking lawful asylum and also one particular family's story. And my guests today are two lawyers who have worked on this particular family's story and can talk about the individual aspects of it as well as the policy aspects. Bridget Cambria is the executive director of ALDEA, which is the People's Justice Center. She's an immigration attorney with the law firm Cambria and Kline and she's also joined by Tobias Barrington Wolff, who's the Jefferson Barnes Fordham professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.

And the last thing I'll say here, if you're listening to this as you're watching the news and the numbers tick up and the insanity of this current moment in which all of life from three weeks ago seems unrecognizable, is that the same grim social logic of who is on the outside and who's on the inside, who's marginalized and exposed and who isn't, pertain to before the virus hit and is now being exacerbated by that. And these are the stories of just a few of those people.

CHRIS HAYES: Let's start with this. One of the things ... I forgot who said this, but someone said recently about US immigration policy under the Trump administration, having to do with asylum seekers at the southern border. They said, ""Trump got his wall and it's the country of Mexico. That he has turned Mexico into the wall through a policy Orwellianly called The Migration Protection Protocols."" Tobias, can you just talk a little bit about what MPP is?

TOBIAS WOLFF: Sure. And I'm going to defer to Bridget on some of the on-the-ground details, which she knows a lot better than I do. But MPP attempts to do is to force people who are coming to the United States presenting themselves at the border as lawful asylum applicants- instead of remaining the United States during the pendency of their asylum claims, either in detention facilities or released on recognizance subject to monitoring and accountability that would require them to show up for their asylum hearings, which of course the overwhelming majority of people do. And instead, what it does is to force them back across the border into Mexico. And most of these ... almost all of these asylum applicants have no relationship with Mexico. They have no family or resources in Mexico and many of them wind up being homeless and in desperate circumstances and vulnerable to trafficking and vulnerable to harm and exploitation and all kinds of really serious ways.

If I can offer some critical commentary, I think one of the purposes of the program is to terrorize people and to make people so afraid of coming to the United States to present asylum claims that they choose not to do so in the first place.

CHRIS HAYES: Bridget, can you talk about what it means for these populations that are coming from Central America seeking asylum, ending up at the border and now finding themselves essentially thrust back into Mexico along border towns where they have essentially nothing? The clothes on their back, whatever the cash they've been able to carry and nothing else.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: I can tell you that for the families, about 50,000+ people who have been forced to remain in Mexico while trying to lawfully seek asylum, their lives are absolute hell. Most of them live on the street or in shelters where they're not allowed to remain for a long period of time. The wait periods for them to be heard in an immigration court are upwards of one year. And at that point, they have no stable living, they have no safe living, they have no support from the Mexican government, and the majority of these people are children. And what we've seen is large-scale violence and targeting of Central American asylum seekers in Mexico who are trying to seek asylum in the United States, which is their legal right.

And what the United States has done is, in fact, create a giant detention center in Mexico. It is their prison. And we have about 50,000+ detainees. In the United States, we now have more than 50,000 detainees on the Mexican border trying to seek asylum. It's a wide scale increase of the detention population and it involves the most vulnerable of us. It involves families, it involves women, it involves very young children, and they're desperate. And they're just desperate for protection and they're desperate to seek what they're lawfully entitled to, which is the opportunity to lawfully seek asylum in the United States.

CHRIS HAYES: Just to follow up on something you said, Bridget, there are several news reports about people who present at the border for asylum are then kept in Mexico under this MPP protocol who have been targeted for robbery, kidnapping and even murder. I mean, they are essentially sitting ducks there, right?

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: That's correct. Colleagues of mine have had clients who have been murdered in Mexico. They have clients who have been raped in Mexico. They have children who have been kidnapped, fathers who have been ransomed. It's the worst violence that you could imagine. And they're doing this for simply the opportunity to seek protection in the United States and their desperation, the violence that they're fleeing is so bad that they're willing to take that risk. And what we've done is not only have we taken that vulnerable population that is already at risk, but we've suggested them to exploitation on the border. These people are sitting ducks for traffickers. These people are sitting ducks for cartels that are willing to exploit them. These are people who are ransomed for thousands of dollars from family members in the United States and no one is helping them.

Instead, they're just subject to this policy which, when you began you stated that this is Trump's wall. It's one of many legal pieces that this administration has put forth to bar people from seeking asylum in the United States. It's one of many different hurdles that the government has enacted to prevent people from applying for asylum in the United States. And the reason that they're preventing families, they're preventing Central Americans from applying for asylum is because they lawfully have that right and they can win their cases and that terrifies this administration that they have a lawful way to seek refuge in this country and the right to remain in this country.

CHRIS HAYES: There's been a remarkable onslaught of policies that have been administratively issued through the Department of Homeland Security, which contains the vast immigration bureaucracy of the country. It's been filtered down. None of this is statutory changes. It's not that Congress has passed and the president has signed a big whole scale revision to asylum law. They have just done a huge array of things inside the executive branch to essentially create this condition, Bridget, you just talked about. How have they done that legally?

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: They've just done it. They believe that their executive power allows them to do anything that they want in immigration policy. So, they've enacted two asylum bans. They've enacted a transit ban, which says if you cross through any country before you come to the United States, you're banned from asylum. That's not in any statute or law anywhere. Those are administrative policies. They've enacted three Muslim bans. They've enacted these migrant protection protocols. They've enacted a program called HARP and PACER, which subject women, men and children to expedited removal while sitting in an ICE box under the custody of Customs and Border Protection. And they've also changed the policies for expedited removal within the United States, which is used against families who are detained in family detention centers.

In every facet of immigration policy, the administration has made it extremely difficult for people to seek asylum, especially if they're coming from Central America, and that doesn't even account for the actual legal changes that they have made within asylum laws, themselves, by taking their authority in the executive and arbitrarily changing cases, which have been decided as recently as a year ago. The attorney general has taken cases that he wants to change and changed them unilaterally, trying to take the right for people who are victims of domestic violence, their right to seek asylum. People who are fleeing gang violence, their right to seek asylum. And he's done it unilaterally without going through Congress and without seeking any kind of lawful change to the laws.

CHRIS HAYES: Immigration law is a crazily complex area that I find every time that I have to report on it I quickly get very confused. But one top line that we've seen in a variety of cases is that there is a fair amount of executive latitude in immigration. Tobias, what have the courts done in response to this onslaught? We've seen in other areas in which the Trump administration was extremely aggressive in administrative actions. They've been brushed back quite a bit, sometimes because of sloppiness, sometimes because of sheer bad faith and lying, as in the Census case. But they do seem to have had a fair amount of success in the total onslaught they've undertaken on immigration law.

TOBIAS WOLFF: Yeah, one of the most disheartening decisions from the Supreme Court in the immigration space was in response to the final version of the anti-Muslim immigration order, the travel ban, that went up to the Supreme Court. And the court issued this decision that quite explicitly said, ""We have to judge this policy based on the powers that are possessed by the presidency and the deference owed to the office of the presidency and not based on our view of this particular president."" In slightly less explicit language, the court said exactly that. And Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a very sharp dissent in that case in which she took the unusual step of describing the current occupant of the presidency by name in explaining the things that he had said and the steps that he had taken that indicated a really ugly and biased purpose behind this policy.

And there's a constitutional scholar whom you're acquainted with who has written a lot about presidential speech and its relationship to intent when the government passes biased policies. And that work bares a lot on what the Supreme Court was not willing to look at here. The court took the most conservative possible approach to that set of questions.

In the set of claims that we actually wound up litigating in front of the third circuit that bore on some jurisdictional issues, the court has been a little bit more in the middle when it comes to the question of what types of claims can come into federal court in the first place, which is a lot of what we wound up litigating in front of the third circuit in this case. But when it comes to actually reviewing the substance of what the administration is doing on immigration, it has so far not given a lot of reason for hope that they will take a hard and careful look at what these people are doing.

CHRIS HAYES: You just mentioned a specific case that the two of you have been working on litigating and I want to talk about that case right after we take this quick break. You have clients who you have been litigating on behalf of. Bridget, maybe you can just tell me the story of your clients.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: Well, for the last five years I've been part of an organization called ALDEA, the People's Justice Center. And our mission has been to universally represent every family whose detained in immigration detention in the state of Pennsylvania. And that encompasses by and large a place called the Berks County Residential Center, which is a family detention center and most people don't know that it's here. It holds 96 beds and it holds mothers, fathers and their children and it holds them for indefinite periods of time. It's the only facility in the United States of America that will do that.

CHRIS HAYES: So this is family detention for immigrant families in Pennsylvania, 96 beds and you said they can hold them indefinitely. My understanding is that there's a consent decree called the Flores decision that traces back years and that has been fought, there've been battles in both the Obama administration and now the Trump administration that essentially caps, that provides a kind of time limit for family detention under that civil lawsuit, which was then settled with a consent decree. Does that not apply to Berks?

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: Oh, it absolutely does. And in the five years that I've been there, we've sued in the Flores settlement more than three times. The longest child detained in Pennsylvania was detained for 707 days with his mother and currently the family that we represent right now, Mia and her father have been detained for 254 days. Now, those detention periods are unlawful and in each of the times that we sued under the settlement, we were successful because their detention for that period of time is unlawful, but you have to hold the government accountable and expect that they will follow the laws. And I'm sure that we all have seen in this administration, it's difficult to have those who are in charge of immigration enforcement actually follow their own laws.

CHRIS HAYES: So what you're saying, just so that I understand, you have a client named Mia and her father, which country are they from?

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: They're from Guatemala.

CHRIS HAYES: They're from Guatemala and where were they detained originally?

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: They were actually first detained along the Southern border of the United States in California where they entered without inspection. They were then taken into custody in an ICE box where they were held for more than a week in a room that has a cinder-block floor that was very cold. There's very little to eat, there's very little sanitation. It's very difficult for children to be there, they were there for about seven days. At which point they were told that they were going to be returned to Mexico and they were, and they were returned to Mexico for a period of two months before they were allowed to see an immigration judge, during which point they were homeless for much of the time, they were in the streets of Mexico, they were threatened by Mexican authorities. They slept out in the street or in a park and at one point were taken in by a good Samaritan until their court hearing.

CHRIS HAYES: Just into their house, into the good Samaritan's house?

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: That's correct.

CHRIS HAYES: Wow.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: It was in Tijuana.

CHRIS HAYES: It was in Tijuana. So just a Mexican citizen, just out of compassion said “you're on the street, come stay with me.”

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: That's correct. And if you would see this family, you might understand why the ... It's a father and a daughter and fathers in Mexico have a very difficult time finding shelter because a lot of shelters only want to take women or children. It was a father and his daughter and his daughter is an extremely tiny, tiny girl. I could see, seeing them on the street crying wanting to take them into my home and that's sort of what happened, but it's not a permanent solution. So when they went to court, which was two months after they were thrown into Mexico, they begged the court to allow them to enter the United States.

They were not allowed to enter the United States and this father, through desperation, did anything he could so that his daughter would not be returned to Mexico. And what he did was he waived all of his rights, he gave up all of his rights. And what happened after that is they were taken into custody by ICE and brought to Pennsylvania for removal. So they were brought literally from the state of California to the state of Pennsylvania to get on a plane to go to Guatemala.

CHRIS HAYES: So they have an asylum claim and I want to talk about the substance of that claim. They make a long trip from Guatemala, which of course is both expensive and treacherous and dangerous. They arrive at the Southern border where they are apprehended. They are then returned to Mexico through this new policy, the return to Mexico policy. They spend two months essentially homeless or a large chunk of that homeless on the streets of Tijuana. They are taken in by a good Samaritan there, they finally get an immigration judge and date and what happens there is that in desperation and not be sent back to Mexico, the father waives his rights to his asylum claim.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: And his daughters.

CHRIS HAYES: And his daughters, at which point ICE says, okay, now you're going to be deported.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: And that's the goal of the MPP program.

CHRIS HAYES: It's what they're trying to do, right?

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: Exactly.

CHRIS HAYES: They want to make it so painful, so difficult and so awful for people with asylum claims that they rescind their asylum claims so they could be deported under the law and never have to be dealt with again.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: Exactly.

CHRIS HAYES: And up until this point they had not had any legal representation at all.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: None.

CHRIS HAYES: What is the substance of the asylum claim?

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: They are asylum seekers basically fleeing religious persecution. I can't get into the details, the facts of what their actual claim is, but it is an evangelical family, staunchly evangelical. They are from a red zone in Guatemala, and what that means is it's a part of Guatemala that's actually absent of any government authority. It's currently under a state of siege in Guatemala, meaning that the military is in control. It's kind of like martial law in the area where they are from. This young girl was not able to go to school, they weren't able to go to church. Their family was subjected to different types of violence while participating in their church.

They're fleeing religious persecution and the father is a staunch advocate that his daughter should be free to be able to walk on a street and go to school and not be afraid that they will be shot. This little girl had seen many incidents of violence and heard many incidents of violence to the point where she jumps when she hears loud noises and lots of their close friends have actually been gunned down in the area where they lived. And it got to the point where they decided that it was time to leave.

CHRIS HAYES: So the father waives the rights to pursue the asylum claim desperate to avoid being sent back to Mexico, which was horrible. He and his daughter are then transferred to this family detention center in Pennsylvania and they then sit there for how long?

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: They've been detained for 254 days. What had happened was when they got to this detention center, we provide universal representation. So we meet every family that we can there and evaluate their case. And in talking with this family, it was very clear immediately that the reason that they gave up their case was not because they did not want to seek asylum, it was that they felt they had no choice in order to preserve the life of this little girl. So we filed an appeal of that initial determination, that initial waiver of his rights and the appeal was granted because the court determined that the due process rights of this father were violated, that he was not aware or had competent understanding of the proceedings he was in and that the waiver that he made was not knowing or intelligent based on the circumstances involving his daughter.

CHRIS HAYES: One of the things that crops up here is that the outcomes for people that are seeking asylum who have representation versus those who don't is enormous and when you have an administration that doesn't want to grant asylum and have sent that message down through the bureaucracy, has changed some of the actual criteria for granting it, they really don't want people to lawyer up, right Tobias? Like one of the big policy objectives here is just to keep the lawyers away from people trying to pursue their legal rights to asylum.

TOBIAS WOLFF: There's no question about that and what's more in all kinds of ways that are usually hard to document and that are documented in this case, this administration is just acting in bad faith at the very least. And sometimes in defiance of the authority of courts in their attempts to harm these families and the sequence of events that this family went through after they got representation from Bridget and her organization and after they started winning some success in their quest to reopen their case is extraordinary.

One of the steps that the immigration courts took after hearing a proper presentation of these claims and the reasons why the waiver of these rights should not foreclose their asylum claims, is that they issued a stay that said, okay, we're going to look at these claims and you cannot remove this family back to Guatemala. And the government said, well, it doesn't say that we can't send them back to Mexico, it only says we can't send them back to Guatemala, so we're going to stick them on a plane with no notice to council and we're going to send them back to Mexico again. And that's what they tried to do.

CHRIS HAYES: Wait, what?

TOBIAS WOLFF: Yeah.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: That's right.

CHRIS HAYES: Whoa. You successfully win an appeal to essentially rescind the rescission of his legal claims, right? To say, look, he was not fully aware of what he was doing. You win that appeal. There's an injunction issued by the court that says you cannot deport these people to Guatemala, and the government says, fine, we'll send them back to Mexico and they try to put him on a plane?

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: It's almost worse than that. So this was before they had actually won their appeal, just upon filing their appeal, showing the defiance, their defiance of this whole process, within a week of them filing their appeal and receiving a stay from the appeals court, they were taken from the Berks facility under the guise that they were being released from custody.

CHRIS HAYES: That's what they told them?

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: That's what they told them. They even threw a party for the little girl.

CHRIS HAYES: Shut up.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: They threw a party for the little girl telling her that she was going to go to her mother who lives in New Jersey and instead of doing that, they kidnapped them from this facility, put them on a plane and took them to San Diego, while we ran to court to file emergency petitions to stop them from returning them to Mexico.

CHRIS HAYES: How did you find out that your own clients were being essentially kidnapped by the US government in defiance of a court order?

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: It was actually a very terrifying afternoon because we got a call from the facility of this father and his daughter screaming and crying from a legal visit room because they had called earlier in the day happy and grateful, thanking us for helping them. And they were under the impression that they were leaving custody and we're about to reunite with their family and fight their case and everything was okay. And an hour later they called screaming and crying from an ICE legal visitation room because ICE officials were there, multiple ICE officials were there to physically remove them from that building and to put them on a plane to San Diego.

TOBIAS WOLFF: And I just have to say, because Bridget probably won't say this about herself, she and her colleagues are freaking heroes. They put together an emergency petition in the space of about three hours while this family was literally on the plane back to California that was going to result in them being dumped across the border, homeless to Mexico again, and this little girl being subject to trafficking. She was six years old at the time, she's seven years old now and they succeeded in getting an emergency order from a federal court inside of three hours by putting together an extraordinarily impressive petition, faster than ought to be humanly possible.

And the federal court said, put them back on a plane from California to Pennsylvania, return them to this facility, which is what happened. They got all the way to California, they got put back on another plane. Can only imagine what this is doing to this little girl. She gets put back into this detention facility in Pennsylvania and that petition then gets forwarded and assigned to the federal district judge who started hearing their claims and the basis of these claims was that the MPP program is an illegal program and was being administered in a way which violates the statutory and constitutional and consent decree rights of this family. And they did that in an afternoon and if they hadn't, then this family would have been probably beyond their help.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: And it's a really important point that the way that we were able to bring this family back was that no child should be treated the way that this child was. And frankly no child under the Flores settlement should ever be sent to Mexico ever. Because the government has obligations to all children and its custody to provide certain things, one of which is not being homeless in Mexico starving and subject to violence. There are certain requirements that we have of every child that comes into contact with an immigration official and they've reneged on those obligations.

CHRIS HAYES: I mean, federal judges generally don't like it when you just disobey their court orders. What happened when you brought this to the judge's attention?

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: I don't know if the judge was upset. I think what the judge did was give us the appropriate process and that's all we were asking for. We were asking for the opportunity to be heard because the point of this intervention by immigration was to stifle our representation and was to get this family to give up and to stop fighting.

CHRIS HAYES: Right. It seems like the goal of all of this policy is keep people away from representation. If they have representation, make it painful and try to essentially whittle down their will to pursue their legal asylum claims that people give up and they go away.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: That's right. And what the government has resolved to in this case now, because following that, we were successful in their appeal. We were successful in the third circuit eventually with Tobias's wonderful help, is their resolve is detention. They have decided now, well, because you fought and because you won we're just never going to release you.

TOBIAS WOLFF: And I just want to make sure that it's clear, they tried to do this again, right? So we had this federal lawsuit in first, the district court in Philadelphia, and then the third circuit court of appeals and this lawsuit wound up being about whether the federal courts have jurisdiction to hear these challenges to the MPP program. We lost those claims in front of the federal district court and we took an appeal to the third circuit and the whole time that the case was on appeal, we had a negotiated agreement in writing with the U.S. attorney's office in Philadelphia, in the Eastern district of Pennsylvania saying, fine, while the case is pending in front of the third circuit, while the appeal is pending, we won't grab this family and shove them across the border to Mexico again, we'll forbear while this appeal is pending.

CHRIS HAYES: Just to be clear, this is after you have successfully gotten them back from San Diego back to the Berks facility back in Pennsylvania after they tried once to get them out of the country?

TOBIAS WOLFF: Exactly.

CHRIS HAYES: So you win that, you file an emergency stay, you get them to transfer them back. You're now pursuing this legal avenue through the federal courts, which is a narrow jurisdictional question, which is do these people have standing essentially to have their case heard in the federal courts outside the immigration courts, which are located inside DOJ?

TOBIAS WOLFF: Right. It's not a standing issue, but it's close enough. It's a jurisdiction issue. Exactly. And the Flores issue is less about whether the claims can be heard in immigration court versus federal court, but whether they can be heard frankly in federal court at all.

CHRIS HAYES: I see. Okay.

TOBIAS WOLFF: And so that whole process started in late August and September and the government lawyers said, ""Fine, while the appeal is pending, we won't try to kick them across the border to Mexico again."" And so we brief the case. We argue the case in November. The court gives us a fantastic decision in mid February where the court on almost every claim says, ""Yes, the federal courts have the jurisdiction to decide these claims and we're going to send it back to the district court to move forward."" And so we thought, ""Great."" And so then the government lawyers came to Bridget and said, ""Well, we only agreed not to kick this family across the border to Mexico while the appeal was pending."" Appeal's not pending anymore-

CHRIS HAYES: Because you won.

TOBIAS WOLFF: Because we won. ""And so we're giving you notice that we claim the legal right to kick this family across the border of New Mexico at any time and what are you going to do about it?"" And they started some conversations and there was a couple of days of grace period and so forth. And we had a mediation with the third circuit and the government wouldn't budge. And their position became that they were willing to separate this father and daughter and maybe send the father back across the border to Mexico, but not the daughter, which of course would just be another way of traumatizing this poor little girl who has now spent about 10 percent of her life in federal detention.

And so we took the extraordinary step of going back to the third circuit with an emergency petition and said, ""Look, you need to defend the integrity of your processes in your jurisdiction. They're trying to send this family across the border, which will interfere with our ability to represent them. And what's more is just a flagrant violation of the authority of the order that you just issued, which is an order that says that they should have the opportunity to present these claims in federal court."" And the third circuit responded by telling the government that they had, I think, Bridget, it was just a tiny bit more than 24 hours to respond to our briefing, and they put together their response and 24 hours later, I think it was the third circuit issued the emergency order that we requested and said, ""This family will not be sent back to Mexico pending further order of this court."" And so that was a great victory for this family, but it was a victory that we frankly never should have had to win.

CHRIS HAYES: Well and it also makes you wonder like how, I mean obviously this is ... It's like the old joke about the drunk looking for his keys underneath the streetlight because that's where the light is. This is a case that we can see because these people have representation but there's tons of people without representation who this is probably happening to all the time if they're doing this. If they're trying this with you, obviously very competent and zealous advocates, what do they do with the tens of thousands of people they run through the system with no lawyers?

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: They do everything they can. They use every trick in the book. They're doing what they did to us, to our client who is seven years old. She's seven and the amount of lawyers that they have in court to ensure that this child either stays detained or gets deported or gets put in Mexico, I've never seen so many lawyers.

CHRIS HAYES: And this is not even evaluating the asylum claim.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: Absolutely not.

CHRIS HAYES: They could just say, ""Look, okay, let's just hear the asylum claim on the merits,"" but they don't want that.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: Exactly, and it's very important to understand that these battles, they're not about the immigration process. This is about what rights do immigrants have and the administration believes that an immigrant has no rights, no constitutional rights, no rights to even have a case heard in a court. This is about are they human beings or are they individuals we can do whatever we want with? And it's the position of the government right now that every immigrant in our system has zero constitutional rights and it's a great example.

This girl, Mia, seven years old, has been in litigation for 10 percent of her life and has been detained for 10% of her life and she knows that she won a court case two weeks ago. She knows that and she's seven years old. Having that conversation with her was absolutely ridiculous because when I told her that she had won a case, she jumped out of her seat screaming and cheering and what did she win? She won jurisdiction, but she's in a detention center screaming and cheering and she told her father at that moment, ""You know what, I can do this dad. I can do this. We're going to keep fighting."" It's pretty unbelievable.

CHRIS HAYES: So that victory is the one that, Tobias, you were just saying, right? That was the circuit court granting your essentially petition to stop any deportation.

TOBIAS WOLFF: Well, it was granting us the right to have those claims challenging the MPP heard. And the basic position that the government took is that there are these provisions of the immigration statute that say that most claims that have to do with deportation should be heard first by the immigration courts and that the federal courts can only get involved when there's a review of a final decision by the immigration courts. And the problem is that what we're challenging here specifically about MPP is not the disposition of their asylum claims, is not their status as immigrants. It is the abusive treatment that the government is trying to inflict on them while they are in custody and while they are pursuing those claims and if the government can abuse them while they're pursuing their claims and then only after they finish their claims and they seek appellate review, can they say, ""Well wait, you weren't supposed to abuse us in the first place.""

That's obviously far too late. And one of the things that the appellate court did, the third circuit panel did, which was quite extraordinary, was to frame its decision explicitly around that principle. And the decision sort of frames the question, “If not now, when?” And the court says, ""Often the answer is later for immigrants."" Often the answer is that you have to package everything in one shot at the federal courts and you only get that shot after you've exhausted your avenues with the immigration courts. But when what you're challenging is the way that the government is treating you while you are here attempting to assert your rights, then it's too late to say you're not allowed to do this until everything is finished in the immigration courts.

CHRIS HAYES: So I want to pursue the question of the underlying case against MPP as being unlawful. Before we do that, I just want to get a sense, maybe Bridget, you can speak to this since you've been doing the work for a while. One of the things that happens in coverage of immigration is that people find much to their horror that some of the terrible things that we do on the immigration policy happened before Trump. I mean the conditions in which migrants had been kept in, the iceboxes had been a fixture on the border for literally decades. How would you characterize the shift? What about this in the Trump years is new and what isn't?

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: Well, I'm going to be very clear that I sued Obama several times for his treatment of children and immigration custody. Family detention began a long time ago, around 2001 in the United States. It expanded in 2014 under the Obama administration, which resulted in three family detention centers in the United States, holding about 3,500 women, men and children. It was the first time that we've ever held children in custody for extreme lengths of time. Those are accompanied children. We have the same problem with unaccompanied children.

We saw that starkly when the images of the Clint facility came out, what was happening to those children, but the shift under the Trump administration is the extreme callousness of the treatment of children in our system. We had rules under the Obama administration that we could enforce. Now they're saying that those rules don't even apply. We had seven children die in immigration custody since the Trump administration came in. That did not happen before. We've had children sitting in for seven to 14 days. During the Clint time, it was upwards of a month. Wow. I mean, these are things that have never happened. In these iceboxes, you are not allowed to be there more than 72 hours and even that is too long.

CHRIS HAYES: Yeah. These are just cinder block outposts usually in very deserted parts of the border... They're not detention facilities. They're just these freezing buildings with a toilet and a sink.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: Exactly. And the government's job is to immediately upon a child coming into their custody, begin working efforts to release that child to a safe environment. And we stopped doing that. We've gone to tension first, release whenever. That's the difference in this administration, aside from the fact that the deterrence idea has just exploded. We're going to detain everyone. We're going to deter everyone. We're going to change the laws. So the difference between the Obama administration and the Trump administration is it's just worse. It's as if the blueprint was created before, but now we're running full force. It's absolutely horrible. We all saw family separation. It was probably the worst thing that any of us could imagine because we saw those children and thought of our own children. That has not ended. It's just taken a new form of horror and we need to put the spotlight back on what's happening to these kids.

CHRIS HAYES: What do you mean by that? Explain.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: So we're not separating kids from their parents. Instead, we're sticking them in Mexico. Instead, we're putting-

CHRIS HAYES: With their parents.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: With their parents. That's correct. We're putting them into programs where they have zero rights, zero access to an attorney. We're putting them in iceboxes for prolonged periods of time. In the Dilley family detention center in Texas, there's a group of 200 women and children who are currently at six months plus of the detention and no one knows they're there. They're suffering the most horrific medical issues because of their prolonged detention. I had to sue with a group of 10 amazing attorneys two weeks ago for a five-year-old with a fractured skull to see a doctor.

CHRIS HAYES: From Dilley?

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: From Dilley. I mean just to see a doctor, we had to go to federal court. I mean, the treatment of children in the immigration system and families specifically is absolutely horrendous and unfortunately it's not on TV anymore. And I'd encourage you, Chris, to keep focusing on it.

CHRIS HAYES: Well, part of that has to do with the successful ... I mean it's interesting you raise that point because we've been talking about this internally. A big part of it is because so much of it is happening in Mexico, it's just harder for us to get the cameras out, right? When they were dealing with migrants by sticking them in these American facilities or underneath essentially a bridge in El Paso or visits that officials made into some of those facilities, we could bring cameras and we can get to them. We can bring cameras into a Juarez shelter, but it has been successful in essentially removing it to the other side of the border in terms of the sort of spotlight.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: Exactly, or hiding it in centers that they don't allow cameras into.

TOBIAS WOLFF: Another part of this is the debasement of the government in the positions that it's taking in federal court in defense of these policies, right? So this is a harder thing to convey in a way that really lands, but specifically the Flores settlement, the Flores consent decree to protect kids. And as Bridget said, it protects kids in detention conditions of confinement and release. And it should be pretty obvious that it's a violation of a settlement that says that you have to protect the best interest of children if the way that you're going to release a child is to dump them on the street and in a dangerous neighborhood to be homeless. I mean, that should be a no brainer. And the question that we faced in this case was, can a kid who is protected by this settlement go into federal court and protect her rights in the place where she's being detained?

And the settlement says exactly that. The settlement contemplating exactly this eventuality says a kid can go wherever there's ""jurisdiction and venue"", which basically means wherever is the appropriate convenient place for the lawsuit to be heard. You can go into federal court and sue to enforce your rights. And in arguing against that, the government, the Department of Justice filed a brief in which ... And this was a brief I want to mention, which was signed by Jody Hunt, who is the head of the civil division of the justice department. That doesn't always happen. He put his name to this brief, and in this brief they took the position that a consent decree that binds the United States government that defines the rights and obligations of people in the context of immigration and federal detention, an area where the government is constantly claiming plenary authority. This is an inherently federal set of issues, so forth.

They said, ""No, no, no, that doesn't belong in federal court at all. What are you talking about? This is just an agreement. There's no basis for jurisdiction in the federal courts over this agreement."" And we laid out very clearly that of course there is. There's 70 years of case law that says that agreements that bind the United States government that deal with inherently federal issues like this are agreements that are governed by federal law.

CHRIS HAYES: This happens all the time. I mean, there's federal consent decrees across the country on things like housing segregation or lawsuits about pollution at superfund sites that are just people are back and forth in front of federal court all the time. Or just people are back and forth in front of federal court all the time. The standard part of the way that a consent decree is essentially refereed.

TOBIAS WOLFF: Well, sure. And usually what happens is that you are going to the court that issued the decree because that's the natural place to bring your lawsuit, right? This is a case where the decree, for obvious reasons, specifically contemplates that people are going to be detained in all kinds of places, so they should go to the federal court where they're detained. And this Department of Justice comes in and says, ""No, no, no, there's no jurisdiction in the federal courts."" And on that issue, when it was laid out very clearly in the briefs and we had the oral argument in front of the third circuit... I mean, you can't always tell how a panel is thinking about an issue, but they were, I think, I don't want to speak for the judges obviously, but my impression is that they were flabbergasted.

CHRIS HAYES: Your claim right now, the case you're pursuing says that the migration protection protocol, which is the shorthand for this policy of mass removal back to Mexico while people seeking asylum wait for their claims to be moved through immigration courts and be adjudicated, that that itself is unlawful. What's the case for that?

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: Well, the ninth circuit just found that and has issued a stay of the MPP program in anticipation of whether the Supreme Court is going to take cert on that state issue, finding that it's clearly unlawful. And the basis for it being unlawful is that the statute upon which they're relying does not permit for MPP to be applied against those who enter the United States without inspection, one, meaning that they set foot in the United States and request protection, or it's also not allowed to be applied to people who are seeking asylum because there's a separate section under which they are normally apprehended and subject to expedited removal or another process which takes into account their fear. So it makes common sense if you just break it down into what it is really. Think about it. The people that they are sending to Mexico are asylum seekers. You cannot send an asylum seeker under our laws to any place where they will face harm.

CHRIS HAYES: That's the whole point.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: That's the whole point. The anticipation of the MPP program, the statute in which they rely on, is for people who typically enter the United States through a port of entry. And you just can't tell what their documents are or what status they actually are, and you need a couple moments to figure out, well, do they have a visa? Is their visa good? Do they have a crime or something that we need to take a second to look at? And we sort of hold you in that in status. But if you are an asylum seeker and you have no papers to enter the United States, it is clear what your status is, you are inadmissible to the United States but for your application for asylum.

And what they did is they took this one section of the law that would permit somebody to wait in a contiguous territory to determine what your status to enter the United States is, they took that section and just blew it up to encompass asylum seekers. And there are separate sections that apply to asylum seekers that they're just saying, well, we're just not going to use that section. And the court is like, well, how do you determine what section this person actually belongs in? The government's-

CHRIS HAYES: I see. So they're reclassifying these people, essentially.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: Exactly.

CHRIS HAYES: I see.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: And the government's position is, they're whatever classification we say they are.

CHRIS HAYES: I see. So let me ask you this. I'm going to play devil's advocate for a second. So there's an argument that's been made by immigration restrictionists, by people like Stephen Miller and Donald Trump and others who support him, that essentially the asylum laws are being abused, that they were never intended to deal with these kind of mass migrations of folks coming from Central America. That essentially through the grapevine and through folk knowledge, what was being passed down to people in Central America were things to say when presenting yourself at the border, so as to pass your credible fear interview and enter into the pipeline of asylum, and maybe get asylum even though fundamentally what they really were, were economic migrants and they are a category of migrant that the asylum laws are not designed for. What do you say to people who say this is just closing a bunch of loopholes?

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: I think that it doesn't understand the populations we're dealing with. The majority of those who are seeking asylum in the United States currently are from Central America. They're from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. They're south of our border. They have the ability to migrate here. We wouldn't say the same thing if we were talking about people fleeing the Democratic Republic of Congo or Angola or Syria. We know why they're fleeing. The Central American countries that we're talking about are tantamount to war zones, and what's most terrifying about what's going on in those countries right now is that the target of violence in those countries is primarily women and children. And the types of violence that they're facing are the types of violence that you have nightmares about. Finding your child shot dead, finding your child kidnapped or your wife raped. These are the things that they're fleeing.

And it stems from longtime civil wars that took place in those countries, and genocides, with the instance of Guatemala. There was a genocide against the indigenous peoples of Guatemala. And those have affected one generation later and the generation later is now that the guerillas have been replaced by the gangs, but you still have the disparate treatment of these populations in those areas. So are they economic migrants? Do they want to work? Of course. Anyone that goes to any place in any part of the world wants to have a life. But the things that they're fleeing is the right to live and the right to raise their children, the right for their children to go to school without being kidnapped, the right for their wives and their daughters to grow up and not suffer gender-based violence.

I don't think that those are frivolous claims and that's why we have a system of laws in the United States to deal with accepting those people. We have a credible fear process, which screens migrants who come to the border and seek asylum. Now, are they messing around with that process? Absolutely, and I have a separate lawsuit actually for that case as well. But we do have laws that allow each of those people, each of the people that are fleeing Central America from a lawful process to seek asylum. There's nothing wrong with that.

TOBIAS WOLFF: And I want to add one thing to that and if I could, which is even if you credit some of the predicates of the argument that immigration restrictionists make, even if you start from the assumption that you think that people are presenting themselves dishonestly or that they don't have real asylum claims, even if that's what you think is going on, and for all the reasons that Bridget just laid out, I think that's just flat wrong. But even if that's what you think is going on, a civilized nation does not deal with that issue by deliberately brutalizing children.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: That's correct.

CHRIS HAYES: Right.

TOBIAS WOLFF: And having an explicit policy of trying to terrorize people with a threat that whatever they're suffering in their home country, they're going to suffer worse at the hands of the United States government, and so don't even try. And the fact that the people in this current administration are making these arguments in which they're denying the reality of what these families are experiencing and then inflicting harms on them that should never be inflicted by a government that purports to be a government of laws and that purports to be an advanced democracy, is just astounding to me. And that they can stand up, and I mean, explicitly say we are going to deter them. And what that means is we are going to scare the crap out of them by harming them worse than they think there'll be harmed at home, and that's our response to an imperfect situation at the border, I think is just appalling.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: And it hasn't worked.

TOBIAS WOLFF: Right.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: We took their children and it didn't work. These are people fleeing for their lives. If you're fleeing your house on fire, you're going to leave. You're not going to sit in that building and burn.

CHRIS HAYES: This is the truly ghastly logic of deterrence, is that if you are attempting to deter against the kinds of things that people are fleeing in Central America, you need to inflict on them harms and horror equal to what they're fleeing. And so you essentially are in a kind of race to the bottom with cartels. Right?

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: That's right.

CHRIS HAYES: Because what's happening in Central America is horrific beyond words and horrifying and frightening. And so if the idea is you're going to scare the bejesus out of people from coming here, well, they're making a calculation about whether they're going to end up with a bullet in the back of their head or homeless on the streets of Tijuana. And being homeless on the streets in Tijuana is horrible, but it's better than a bullet in the back of your head.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: And the numbers have not decreased.

CHRIS HAYES: That's really revealing.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: This month, I believe the numbers have escalated. And this is under the worst policies that you could imagine.

CHRIS HAYES: So final question, and I don't know if either of you feel equipped to answer it, but I'll ask it. I mean, the president of Mexico, López Obrador, is a very known and proud leftist figure, a leftist insurgent who unsuccessfully campaigned for the presidency before he finally won. I think it was the third time he ran. He is a man of the left in just about every way in the way that he has governed in the past. He just invited Evo Morales, who was seeking refuge after he was chased out of Bolivia under extremely legally dubious circumstances. How is it that AMLO, López Obrador, has become the henchman for the Trump campaign of terror against migrants in Mexico?

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: I would say it's about money. I would say that the threat of tariffs and the threat of the United States reneging on its agreements to cooperate with the country has sacrificed the tens of thousands of women and children who are simply seeking the right to live.

CHRIS HAYES: So essentially, the Trump administration has successfully coerced them into this.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: I don't see any other explanation for it. What other reason would we have for tent cities on our border on the Mexican side?

CHRIS HAYES: Yeah.

BRIDGET CAMBRIA: The Mexican peoples of those communities don't particularly like that tens of thousands of migrants are there, especially because the majority of them don't have family ties there. They don't have resources there. And the Mexican government is not helping them. They're doing whatever they can to make them also give up. But you know what? They're still there because they need to seek asylum. They're there to be protected. That's never going to end.

CHRIS HAYES: Bridget Cambria is the Executive Director of ALDEA, the People's Justice Center. She's an immigration attorney with the law firm Cambria & Kline. And Tobias Barrington Wolff is the Jefferson Barnes Fordham Professor of Law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Thank you both so much. That was really, really, really illuminating.

Richard Luscombe reports for us today on the early signs of what happens next in the Republican party on the assumption that Donald Trump is going to be a one-term president.

For four years he commanded their unflinching loyalty. They protected him from impeachment, tacitly approved as children at the border were prised from their parents and placed in cages, and looked the other way as peacefully protesting Americans were gassed for a photo opportunity.

Now, in the death throes of Donald Trump’s presidency, Republicans who once stood shoulder to shoulder with the man who reshaped their political party to his will are scrambling to distance themselves from his unfounded claims that the election is being stolen from him.

“Outrageous, uncalled for and a terrible mistake,” the Maryland governor, Larry Hogan, said of Trump’s erratic pursuit of his false allegations; “very disturbing,” according to the Pennsylvania senator Pat Toomey; and “reckless” in the words of the former presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

This breaking of ranks by growing numbers of senators, congressmen, governors and other elected officials – coming only after Trump’s cause appeared lost – heralds a looming battle for the future direction of the Republican party with its figurehead gone from the stage.

Those now openly critical after years of silence must weigh up the consequences of speaking out while there remain loyalists inside the party determined to carry the banner of Trumpism into the 2024 election and beyond. That faction includes Republican senators such as Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton, and the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, a staunch Trump ally who has urged the president to “fight on, exhaust all options” in his futile effort to prove widespread election fraud.

“Trumpism will remain because he is such a wildly popular figure among their base. But, you know, it’s always been pragmatic for many Republicans,” said Jason Stanley, professor of philosophy at Yale University and author of the bestseller How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them.

“There’s some portion of the Republican party supporting him mainly because he’s Trump, and he’s owning the libs and saying racist things. And then another group is supporting him because he’s pushing through the hardest-right policies.”

'We're going to win this race': Biden addresses the nation as his lead grows

Sign up for the Guardian’s First Thing newsletter

Former vice-president Joe Biden didn’t declare victory on Friday night, but he did tell voters across the United States he believes he has the upper hand as the vote count continues.

“We don’t have a final declaration of victory yet but the numbers tell us a clear and convincing story. We’re going to win this race,” Biden said from the Chase Center in Wilmington, Delaware.

Biden stood on stage flanked by California senator Kamala Harris, his running mate. “Just look at what has happened since yesterday. Twenty-four hours [ago] we were behind in Georgia now we’re ahead, and we’re going to win that state. Twenty-four hours ago we were behind in Pennsylvania, and we are going to win Pennsylvania. Now we’re ahead, but we’re winning in Arizona, we’re winning in Nevada. In fact our lead just doubled in Nevada.”

The former vice-president spoke as Americans anxiously await counting to conclude in a handful of states. Biden is ahead in the key swing states, with his lead widening as more votes get counted.

On Friday, Biden took the lead in Pennsylvania, whose 20 electoral votes alone are enough to carry him over the threshold. He remained ahead in Nevada, and took the lead in Georgia, where the margin was so slim that the state declared there would be a recount. Trump has a narrow lead in North Carolina, and is expected to win the state of Alaska. Biden’s lead in Arizona, which the Associated Press has called for Biden while other media organizations say it remains too close to call, has slightly shrunk.

As Biden’s inches closer to the presidency, however, Trump reportedly was not ready to concede. After the lead slipped in Pennsylvania, the White House put out a statement insisting “this election is not over”.

“Joe Biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the President. I could make that claim also. Legal proceedings are just now beginning!” Trump tweeted.

Those legal challenges from the Trump campaign and the larger Republican apparatus have slowed down the counting process. The campaign has taken legal action in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Nevada. But legal experts have noted that the lawsuits appear to be long shots and even if successful, they would not change the outcome of the race.

The president and some allied groups have argued, paradoxically, that vote counting in some states should stop and in other places (where Trump might benefit)should continue.

Biden is increasingly favored to emerge as the president-elect when all the counting is over however, and on Friday evening said he was confident of a victory.



“And look at the national numbers. We’re going to win this race with a clear majority of the nation behind us,” Biden said.

The Biden campaign had originally planned to formally declare victory on Friday evening, appearing to believe news outlets would have called the race by then.The campaign had said vice-presidential nominee Harris would introduce Biden, long time supporters and top Democrats, including senior Biden campaign staffers, Democratic national committee chairman Tom Perez, and Louisiana congressman Cedric Richmond, as well as longtime local supporters, had gathered at the Chase Center in anticipation.

Biden himself, three days out from election night, was visibly upbeat, smiling through his short speech.

“We’re going to be the first Democrat to win Arizona in 24 years,” Biden said, smiling. “We’re going to be the first Democrat to win Georgia in 28 years, and we’ve rebuilt the blue wall in the middle of the country that crumbled just four years ago. Michigan, Wisconsin, the heartland of this nation.”

Biden stressed patience.

“I know watching these tallies on TV moves very slowly and as slow as it goes it can be numbing,” he said.

And he looked ahead. “While we’re waiting for the final results I want people to know we’re not waiting to get the work done,” Biden said, adding that on Thursday, he and Harris met with experts on the economy and the coronavirus.

“We have serious problems to deal with – from Covid to our economy to racial justice to the climate change,” Biden said. “We don’t have any more time to waste on partisan warfare.”

“I’ve said many, many times, I’ve never been more optimistic about the future of our nation,” he added.

Meanwhile, Trump and his campaign looked increasingly desperate as reports of internal finger-pointing grew and long-shot legal challenges became more unlikely.

In the months leading up to 3 November, Trump had vowed to wage a serious legal defense if re-election appeared to be slipping away. But the campaign’s response in recent days has been a clumsy set of lawsuits that in reality could only slow the count. Aides and staffers have told national news outlets that there’s no set of competent leaders helming the legal defense strategy.

At the Chase center, Biden ally and Delaware senator Chris Coons appeared unimpressed by the Trump campaign’s approach. “I’ve seen nothing in these lawsuits that have any chance of affecting the outcome” , he told the Guardian. “I’ve been really struck by the incoherence of the arguments made by the president. Principally, ‘I want the counting to stop’ at a moment when, if it stops, Joe Biden’s the winner. He’s arguing at the same time that there’s some vast conspiracy that has somehow worked to his disadvantage when at the same moment in many states the Democratic challengers didn’t win for Senate or Democratic challengers were unsuccessful in taking House seats.”

Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have offered only a half-hearted front of support for Trump. Some have echoed Trump’s unfounded accusations that the election results are rife with fraud. But others have gently said that while every vote should be counted, both Trump and Biden should accept the ultimate results.

“I don’t think it’s unreasonable for the president to wait for that number to be apparent,” said Missouri Senator Roy Blunt at the Capitol, according to Politico. “I also don’t think it’s unreasonable for Vice-president Biden to accept the unofficial result and do whatever he thinks he should do. Part of the obligation of leadership is you should always have in your mind: ‘How do I leave?’”

Comment’s such as Blunts have lead even some Republican staffers to conclude privately that calls by Trump’s allies to drop his efforts to fight the election results might have to end soon.

On Friday evening, another challenge emerged for the Trump administration with reports that Mark Meadows, Trump’s chief of staff, had tested positive for Covid-19."
Trump will no longer receive special Twitter treatment if he loses election,"['Alex Hern', 'Kari Paul']","Policy that protects ‘newsworthy individuals’ from having accounts banned for breaking rules wouldn’t apply to Trump

Sign up for the Guardian’s First Thing newsletter

Donald Trump could lose more than just the presidency this January. Twitter has confirmed that, if Trump leaves office, he will no longer receive special treatment as a “newsworthy individual”.

Twitter’s policy around newsworthiness protects certain people – such as elected officials with more than 250,000 followers – from having their accounts suspended or banned for rule infractions that would otherwise lead to severe penalties.

That policy is what has led to the company muting, but not removing, at least 12 tweets from the US president over the past week that cast doubt on the democratic process.

But, Twitter has confirmed, the policy does not apply to former elected officials. They have to follow the same rules as everyone else, and if a tweet breaks those rules, it gets removed. Were Trump to continue breaking Twitter’s rules regularly post-presidency, his account could be suspended.

“Twitter’s approach to world leaders, candidates and public officials is based on the principle that people should be able to choose to see what their leaders are saying with clear context,” a spokesman told the Guardian. “This means that we may apply warnings and labels, and limit engagement to certain Tweets. This policy framework applies to current world leaders and candidates for office, and not private citizens when they no longer hold these positions.”

That will present Trump with a choice once he leaves office: either tone down the rhetoric or face the prospect of his hugely influential following being taken away from him.

Meanwhile, lawmakers and human rights groups have renewed calls to suspend the president’s account even before a possible transition of power in January.

On Wednesday, the Democratic representative Gerry Connolly of Virginia called on Twitter in a tweet to “suspend his account”.

“This is pure disinformation. Valid votes are being counted. This is America, not Russia,” he said in response to Trump tweets that included baseless suggestions of voter fraud.

David Cicilline, a Democrat and Rhode Island representative, also called for Twitter to suspend Trump’s account for “posting lies and misinformation at a breathtaking clip”. Cicilline is the chair of the House antitrust subcommittee and has targeted Twitter with pointed questioning in recent hearings.

On Thursday, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the watchdog group Common Cause submitted a joint letter to Jack Dorsey, the Twitter CEO, requesting Trump’s account be temporarily suspended to prevent the spread of misinformation about the election.

“We fear that, in the absence of action by Twitter, the president may be successful in his goal of delegitimizing the integrity of our democratic processes for many, and not just Twitter users but other voters and members of the public, sowing uncertainty about the voting and elections process, and potentially inciting violence against civil servants or others,” the groups wrote.

A Twitter spokesperson said the company has received the letter and “intends to respond”."
Georgia becomes center of battle for Senate as races head to runoff elections,['Guardian Staff'],"If Democrats were to win the seats, it would split the chamber 50-50, with the vice-president serving as a tie-breaker

Georgia becomes center of battle for Senate as races head to runoff elections

Sign up for the Guardian’s First Thing newsletter

Two key Senate races in Georgia are headed for a runoff, making the southern state the center of the battle between Democrats and Republicans for control of the Senate.

Republican David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff will face off in a 5 January runoff for Perdue’s seat. Libertarian candidate Shane Hazel was able to get enough votes so that neither Perdue nor Ossoff was able to clear the 50% threshold needed for an outright win.

It became clear earlier this week that Democrat Raphael Warnock and Republican Kelly Loeffler are headed for a runoff on the same day for Georgia’s other Senate seat.

Nationally, Democrats and Republicans can each already count on 48 seats in the Senate. Republicans lead uncalled races in Alaska and North Carolina, so the ultimate balance is likely to come down to what happens in the Georgia runoffs.

Georgia announces recount after presidential race too close to call Read more

If Democrats win the Georgia seats, it would leave the Senate split 50-50, with the vice-president serving as a tie-breaker.

If Joe Biden is in the White House, that would mean a vice-president Kamala Harris would be the deciding vote in the Senate. If Donald Trump wins a second term, then it would be Mike Pence, the current vice-president.

Democrats had hoped to wrench control of the Senate from Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, and raised millions of dollars to fight the GOP candidates in states such as Maine, Kansas, Iowa and South Carolina. But larger-than-expected Republican turnout prevented a “blue wave.”

Democrats picked up a seat in Colorado, where the former governor John Hickenlooper defeated Senator Cory Gardner, and Arizona, where former astronaut Mark Kelly beat the Republican incumbent Martha McSally. Democrats lost a seat in Alabama, where Republican Tommy Tuberville defeated the Democratic incumbent, Doug Jones.

The race between Ossoff and Perdue, a close ally of Donald Trump, has been characterized by sharp attack ads but relatively moderate political positions.

Both candidates pivoted to the middle vying for a state Trump won handily four years ago, but where swaths of suburbia have shown signs of disillusionment with the president.

Perdue sought to cast Ossoff as backing a “radical socialist agenda”, while Ossoff portrayed Perdue as a “corrupt” Washington insider who has been part of a botched pandemic response."
The vanishing 'red mirage': how Trump's election week soured,['Luke Harding'],"As he took early wins in key states, it seemed the president had defied his critics again. But it wasn’t to last

For Democrats, the familiar sinking feeling began in the early hours of Wednesday morning when Florida came out for Donald Trump. The state is a critical battleground. Up until that point a Democratic victory in Tuesday’s US presidential election had seemed likely. Joe Biden, the former vice-president, was going to win, the polls said. Probably by a landslide. The only question was the giddy margin.

But the humiliating rout predicted by the pundits wasn’t happening. Trump’s support was holding up remarkably well. This wasn’t just true of diehard fans who had packed into his election rallies in the tumultuous closing days of an extraordinary campaign. Others were backing him as well. This, despite a health pandemic and a divisive presidency like no other.

The Florida results suggested a more complex picture was emerging. For the Biden camp, it was an alarming one. With 96% of ballots counted, Trump was 375,000 votes ahead. Biden, it turned out, had underperformed in the Democratic stronghold of Miami-Dade County. The president had increased his vote among white, working class and Latino people. And among African Americans.

Trump, it seemed, had defied his critics yet again. He comfortably won Texas, crushing Democratic hopes of flipping the state. In the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania – visited repeatedly by both candidates in recent months – Trump was more than half a million votes ahead. There were other notable wins, including Ohio and Iowa. Much of the electoral map was going red.

Before polling day on Tuesday, the Democrats appeared to have a strong chance of gaining control of the Senate. This wasn’t going well either. A raft of Democratic challengers were coming up short. In Maine, the moderate Republican incumbent, Susan Collins, easily beat her rival Sara Gideon. Hopes that Democrats might expand control of the House were fading too.

Those watching the election unfold, in the US and around the world, might be forgiven for thinking history was on a doom loop. The liberal trauma of 2016 – where a dead cert Hillary Clinton victory turned into a Trump triumph – appeared to be happening again. Trump, we discovered, was no freak winner. Tens of millions of Americans were enthusiastically voting for him, in even greater numbers than before.

“This feels all too familiar,” said Laura Hubka, the Democratic chair in Howard County, Iowa. The rural heartland state twice voted for Barack Obama. But it failed on Tuesday to embrace Biden, with Trump’s vote share a couple of points shy of his winning 2016 tally. “He just seems real,” one Trump voter, Elysha Graves, said. “He’s relatable. He’s not a politician.”

Despite the ominous indicators, Biden remained calm as he watched the results come in from his home city of Wilmington, Delaware. Amid the early gloom there was reason for cautious optimism. In the midwest – Michigan, Wisconsin – the race was extremely close. And in Arizona – the home of the late John McCain, Trump’s most prominent Republican critic – Biden appeared to be ahead.

Play Video 1:48 Joe Biden urges calm: 'In America, the vote is sacred' – video

The dynamic of the night was a curious and artificial one. Biden had urged his supporters to cast mail-in ballots. Trump had called on his voters to turn up in person. In many places, these Trump votes were being counted first, giving the impression of an insurmountable lead. Was this real, or the much talked about “red mirage”?

In the East Room of the White House, Trump and his supporters were upbeat. Then, a little before midnight on Tuesday in Washington, Fox News called Arizona for Biden. This was a major blow to Trump’s re-election hopes: the first flip of a state won by Trump in 2016. The president was furious. He dispatched his son-in-law Jared Kushner to remonstrate with Rupert Murdoch. To no avail.

Trump reportedly spent the next few hours ringing Republican governors. At 2.30am he gave a presidential briefing. It was everything his adversaries had feared: an angry and unfounded riff in which he accused the Democrats of fraud. Trump claimed – wrongly – that he had won the election. He suggested the supreme court would intervene. “This is an embarrassment to our country,” he said, to cheers from his family and friends.

The grim scenario, which Trump had been carefully preparing for months, was now being played out on the nation’s TV screens. The president’s argument – that mailed-in votes for Biden amounted to cheating – was untrue. But like previous presidential lies, it was to have ugly real-world consequences. A dark myth was taking shape: that the Democrats had stabbed Trump in the back.

Meanwhile, Biden expressed optimism and urged voters to be patient. Later on Wednesday, results looked increasingly good for him. Trump’s 2016 path to the White House went through Michigan, a traditionally Democratic northern state, and Wisconsin. Now both had swung back and were called for Biden. In a speech that afternoon, he said: “When the count is finished, we believe we will be the winners.”

Slowly but surely, the race was going the wrong way for Trump. The president’s aggressive fightback took a familiar shape: a wave of lawsuits. In Wisconsin the Trump campaign demanded a recount, in Michigan a stop to counting, in Pennsylvania a challenge to the legality of extending ballot deadlines. And so on. The apparent goal: to prevent Trump from sliding, as each ballot was counted, to ignominious defeat.

Five US election headlines you may have missed Read more

The president did not appear on Wednesday. Instead he expressed his growing frustration via Twitter. “We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the election,” he declared. Twitter flagged this and other similar tweets as “misleading”. Social media companies appeared to be trying to atone for the errors of 2016, flagging Trump’s false ex cathedra claims in real time.

As America woke on Thursday, the battle was still too close to call. But Trump’s pathway to the presidency had become increasingly fraught. Biden was on 264 electoral college votes if counting Arizona; Trump on 214. Biden had multiple routes to 270 and the White House; Trump had to win everything. That included Pennsylvania and Georgia, where mail-in ballots were rapidly eroding Trump’s once mighty lead.

Taking their cue from the president, pro-Trump supporters descended on swing state venues where votes were being counted. A small group gathered outside the Pennsylvania Convention Center, shouting: “Stop the count!” and “Let us in!” Police stood guard. Inside, all was normal. Philadelphia election workers in yellow vests who had stayed up all night sipped coffee. They carefully scanned and sorted votes.

Play Video 0:20 ‘Stop the vote’ and ‘count the votes’, say protesting Trump supporters – video

In Arizona, where Trump was clawing into Biden’s lead, it was a different slogan. Demonstrators massed outside an election facility in Phoenix. They shouted: “Count the votes! Count the votes!” One banner read: “Fox News sucks!” One Trump voter complained: “It’s like the news media and social media has people believing all sorts of stuff.” Some protesters were armed.

These contradictory cries made for a compelling split-screen moment. They also undermined the prospect of success for Trump’s multiple legal challenges. First, there was no evidence of fraud. Second, the president was demanding that votes be processed in states where he trailed, and that counting be suspended where he was narrowly ahead. A flailing strategy, as Biden’s campaign manager, Jen O’Malley Dillon, put it.

By Thursday afternoon it appeared Trump was in the grip of the first two stages of grief: rage and denial. Nobody doubted the power of his rhetoric. Or his ability to incite his supporters to come out on to the streets. The president, however, seemed to be waging an increasingly hopeless fight against reality itself, and the inexorable march of numbers that refused to heed his command. It was Canute-like stuff: deranged, arguably, and dangerous for democracy, for sure.

After spending four years denigrating facts, Trump was being slowly mugged by them. Meanwhile, the networks were having a good election. On CNN, the anchor John King plotted results county by county, shading areas blue. “We do the math right now,” he said. By Thursday afternoon, Trump’s lead in Georgia was shrivelling. It was vanishing in Pennsylvania. “Math isn’t on our side,” one Trump aide told CNN. “We need an act of God to alter the course.”

Soon after 4pm on Thursday, Biden made a short address from Wilmington. He began with Covid, citing the latest figure of 240,000 US deaths. His tone was that of a president in waiting. “I ask everyone to stay calm,” he said. He again predicted that when the count was done he and his running mate, Kamala Harris, would emerge as winners. Democracy, he reminded Americans, could be messy.

Biden’s quasi-presidential appearance appears to have enraged Trump further, prompting him to hold his own White House press conference two hours later. It was unrealistic to expect Trump to concede. But even by the ignoble standards of his presidency, Trump’s performance marked a new and horrible low. In effect, Trump repudiated the electoral system because it didn’t let him win.

“If you count the legal votes,” he began, “I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us.” Trump sketched out an amorphous conspiracy. It included “big media, big money and big tech”, as well as the predominantly black cities of Detroit and Philadelphia, where his votes fell short. Republican election observers had to use binoculars to see what was going on, he suggested.

Trump looked beaten and defeated. The vice-president, Mike Pence, was conspicuously missing. It was true that Trump had clocked up some remarkable successes on Tuesday, as he reminded the press. He increased Republican votes by 4 million. But as ever, Trump had sunk to the occasion. His speech was reckless, filled with false claims, and seemingly designed to rouse his base into unhappiness and protest.

Many Americans were appalled. Several news channels including MSNBC cut away from the briefing, and pointed out that Trump was lying. The CNN anchor Anderson Cooper likened the president to an “obese turtle on its back, flailing in the hot sun”. Others noted that his behaviour was that of an authoritarian rather than the holder of a great office – like a Vladimir Putin or Belarus’s thuggish despot leader, Alexander Lukashenko.

Several top Republicans endorsed Trump’s anti-democratic remarks. Others, including Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, stayed silent. By Friday morning, meanwhile, Trump’s hopes of taking the presidency via legitimate means appeared to have died. First, Biden overhauled Trump in Georgia, nudging ahead by 1,097 votes. The gap was so tiny election officials announced a recount. Then, Biden took the lead in Pennsylvania. There was almost certainly no way back.

The next few months look bleakly uncertain. The US is more polarised than ever. Trump is shaping up to be the first one-term president in 28 years. But in contrast to others in that club – among them Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George HW Bush – Trump is unlikely to disappear from politics. With his vast pool of fans, another presidential run in 2024 seems distinctly possible. Trump and Trumpism will continue.

In the meantime, Biden is on the brink of becoming the 46th US president. In a speech on Friday night, he set out the priorities of his new administration: Covid, the economy, climate change, racial justice. And he talked of healing the nation in a post-partisan era. A dream perhaps, but a refreshing one. “I have never been more optimistic for the future of this country,” Biden said.

True, the events of this week were disappointing for Democrats. Candidates for both the House and Senate lost races they should have won. The blue wave that progressives had yearned for turned out to be a more modest tide. And at 77 – soon to be 78 – Biden is a transitional figure. His options in government may be severely limited.

At the same time, the historic dimensions of Biden’s win are astonishing. He won more votes than any US presidential candidate ever – around 75 million. He defeated an opponent with brutal political instincts and a genius for communication. For a while at least, the US and the world can hope for a period of normalcy. Populism hasn’t gone away. But this week it suffered its most significant 21st-century defeat."
"Rupert Murdoch-owned US outlets turn on Trump, urging him to act with 'grace'",['Tom Mccarthy'],"Multiple Rupert Murdoch-owned conservative media outlets in the United States have shifted their messaging in a seeming effort to warn readers and viewers that Donald Trump may well have lost the presidential election.

The new messaging appears to be closely coordinated, and it includes an appeal to Trump to preserve his “legacy” by showing grace in defeat. The message is being carried on Fox News and in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post – all outlets avidly consumed by Trump himself, especially Fox.

One Fox News host, Laura Ingraham, an intimate of the president ever since she spoke at the 2016 Republican national convention, made an astounding statement that seemed directed at Trump personally, advising him to accept defeat “if and when that does happen” with “grace and composure” and appealing to his sense of his own legacy.

Ingraham said in part: “If and when it’s time to accept an unfavourable outcome in this election, and we hope it never comes, but if and when that does happen, president Trump needs to do it with the same grace and composure he demonstrated at that town hall with Savannah Guthrie. So many people remarked about his tone and presence. Exactly what he needs.

“Now losing, especially when you believe the process wasn’t fair, it’s a gut punch. And I’m not conceding anything tonight, by the way. But losing, if that’s what happens – it’s awful. But president Trump’s legacy will only become more significant if he focuses on moving the country forward.”

Laura Ingraham prepares her audience for the likely possibility that the President will lose the election pic.twitter.com/tG50EIHj60 — Acyn Torabi (@Acyn) November 7, 2020

The Wall Street Journal has published an opinion piece with almost the exact same message. It is titled “The Presidential Endgame” and subtitled “Trump has the right to fight in court, but he needs evidence to prove voter fraud”.

“Mr Trump’s legacy will be diminished greatly if his final act is a bitter refusal to accept a legitimate defeat,” the piece warns.

Here is how the article opened: “Perhaps it was inevitable that Donald Trump’s re-election campaign would end as his presidency began: with the president claiming victory and his frenzied antagonists denouncing him as a would-be fascist. The reality is that the US can and probably will have a normal election outcome regardless of the shouting between now and then.

“Mr Biden is leading in enough states to win the presidency, and if those votes survive recounts and legal challenges, he will be the next president.”

The New York Post – which before the election was the launch vehicle for wild and desperate attacks on Joe Biden’s son Hunter – has produced a front page that all but proclaims a Biden victory:

This is a significant front page - the Murdoch empire preparing for a transfer of power..... #election2020 pic.twitter.com/tUJE0CdFK4 — Nick Bryant (@NickBryantNY) November 7, 2020

Top editors at the Post have “told some staff members this week to be tougher in their coverage” of Trump, the New York Times reported, citing two anonymous employees of the paper.

The Times piece said: “On Thursday, in a sudden about-face, Rupert Murdoch’s scrappy tabloid published two articles with a wildly different tone. One accused the president of making an ‘unfounded claim that political foes were trying to steal the election’. The headline on the other described Donald Trump Jr as the ‘panic-stricken’ author of a ‘clueless tweet’.”

News coverage at Fox News has similarly shown little patience with the lies about voter fraud Trump is advancing in hopes of reversing the election.

Asked about the Trump campaign’s assertion that Republican observers had not been allowed to observe vote-counting, the Fox correspondent states flatly: “That’s not true. It’s not true. It’s just not true.”

Holy crap Fox News is going rogue and telling the truth.

Donald Trump's baseless vote fraud claim opens cracks in Republican ranks,"['Tom Perkins', 'Peter Beaumont']","While some GOP figures parrot the president, several current and former elected officials are speaking out

Leading Republican figures moved to distance themselves from Donald Trump’s increasingly inflammatory attempts to cast the election as stolen, as splits emerged in the president’s inner circle over how they should handle the prospect of defeat.

With Trump’s adult children, not least his sons Donald Jr and Eric, emerging with Trump’s lawyer Rudy Guliani as some of the loudest cheerleaders for the false claim the election is being rigged, it has struggled to gain traction in the courts or among the wider Republican party thus far.

Among close allies, South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham and the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, continued to cleave to Trump’s frantic denials that he is on the verge of losing the White House.

Many current and former Republicans, however, are concerned that Trump’s attacks on the integrity of the election are dangerous, with a split emerging between those prepared to speak out and those staying silent.

Inside the White House itself, a different debate is reported to have emerged, between a group of those close to Trump who believe he must be prepared for defeat – even if he refuses to formally concede – and a faction of bitter-enders who believe he should continue to fight through the courts.

While some of those who have spoken out include familiar long-term Republican critics of Trump, such as Utah senator Mitt Romney, others have joined in.

Maryland governor Larry Hogan, a second-term Republican who has not ruled out a 2024 White House bid, is prominent among them, describing the president’s claims as “dangerous” and “embarrassing”.

“If there are legitimate challenges, we have a process – that’s the way it works,” Hogan told the Associated Press.

“But to just make accusations of the election being stolen and widespread fraud without providing any evidence, I thought was really bad for our democratic process and it was something I had never seen in my lifetime.”

Networks cut Trump speech as some Republicans chastise president over election lies Read more

Hogan’s comment follows that of Illinois congressman Adam Kinzinger, who tweeted that the president’s lying “is getting insane” and pleaded with his party to “stop spreading debunked misinformation”.

Others pointed to the inconsistency of Trump’s calls to stop counting in placing he was losing while continuing the count in other places including Missouri Republican senator, Roy Blunt.

“You can’t stop the count in one state and decide you want the count to continue in another state,” Blunt said. “That might be how you’d like to see the system work but that’s not how the system works.”

That includes the Bush-era Republican strategist Karl Rove, who on Wednesday morning said the mass fraud that Trump is alleging was not going to happen in the US.

“Some hanky-panky always goes on, and there are already reports of poll watchers in Philadelphia not being allowed to do their jobs,” Rove said. “But stealing hundreds of thousands of votes would require a conspiracy on the scale of a James Bond movie. That isn’t going to happen. Let’s repeat that: that isn’t going to happen.”

While Republican rebukes of the president are refreshing for many Democrats, it only comes as Trump’s re-election campaign appears doomed. Biden took the lead in Georgia hours after the Wednesday address, and the Democratic challenger is on pace to flip Pennsylvania.

As the president concluded his speech, former representative Carlos Curbelo called for “Republicans to stand up for our democracy at this hour”.

Carlos Curbelo (@carloslcurbelo) By “illegal votes” it seems @potus is referring to votes cast by mail which disproportionately benefitted his opponent this election. Those votes are not in any way illegal. Important for all public leaders, especially Republicans, to stand up for our democracy at this hour.

But as Republicans baselessly claim fraud publicly, at least one GOP official involved in the ballot-counting process has said behind closed doors that voter fraud was not an issue. Stuart Foster, a top state Republican official who trained ballot challengers in Michigan, told trainees just days before the election that he was “confident with our election system”.

Play Video 2:45 Trump, McCain, Bush and Carter: different reactions to bad election results – video

Foster can be heard making the comments in a recording of the training session leaked to the Guardian.

“I’ll get myself into trouble here. I basically made the comment like, so if fraud was so prevalent, then did the Democrats forget to do it in 2016? They just forgot to do it?” he said. “I mean, Trump … barely won. And it’s not because he didn’t win. [Democrats] just didn’t show up. Did they just forget? Fraud was so prevalent, but they just forgot to do it?”

Meanwhile Trump has spent the past week being advised on his way forward by a coterie of familiar faces including former counsellor Kellyanne Conway, Giuliani, Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser and the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, who was recently diagnosed with coronavirus.

Even those who believe a Biden presidency is a done deal are reportedly struggling how to convey the news to Trump.

“They know he’s lost,” one Republican source told the Washington Post in a graphic depiction, “but no one seems willing to tell King Lear or Mad King George that they’ve lost the empire.”"

For four years he commanded their unflinching loyalty. They protected him from impeachment, tacitly approved as children at the border were prised from their parents and placed in cages, and looked the other way as peacefully protesting Americans were gassed for a photo opportunity.

Now, in the death throes of Donald Trump’s presidency, Republicans who once stood shoulder to shoulder with the man who reshaped their political party to his will are scrambling to distance themselves from his unfounded claims that the election is being stolen from him.

“Outrageous, uncalled for and a terrible mistake,” the Maryland governor, Larry Hogan, said of Trump’s erratic pursuit of his false allegations; “very disturbing,” according to the Pennsylvania senator Pat Toomey; and “reckless” in the words of the former presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

This breaking of ranks by growing numbers of senators, congressmen, governors and other elected officials – coming only after Trump’s cause appeared lost – heralds a looming battle for the future direction of the Republican party with its figurehead gone from the stage.

Those now openly critical after years of silence must weigh up the consequences of speaking out while there remain loyalists inside the party determined to carry the banner of Trumpism into the 2024 election and beyond. That faction includes Republican senators such as Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton, and the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, a staunch Trump ally who has urged the president to “fight on, exhaust all options” in his futile effort to prove widespread election fraud.

“Trumpism will remain because he is such a wildly popular figure among their base. But, you know, it’s always been pragmatic for many Republicans,” said Jason Stanley, professor of philosophy at Yale University and author of the bestseller How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them.

“There’s some portion of the Republican party supporting him mainly because he’s Trump, and he’s owning the libs and saying racist things. And then another group is supporting him because he’s pushing through the hardest-right policies.

“I expect the Republican party will prioritise whatever mechanism they need to dominate the courts, to keep suppressing the vote, to make sure that they can, as a minority party, remain in control of the levers of government.”

Stanley questioned the timing of those who appear to be breaking free from Trump by speaking out now.

“The Republican party has been doing this anti-democratic thing since well before Trump,” he said.

“They’ve been acting like the Democrats are not legitimate, and they have no responsibility to co-govern with the Democrats and their sole purpose is to get the Democrats out and rule as a minority party.

“I mean, we’ve had four years of this. When people do what is minimally expected that doesn’t mean you should be filled with praise for them … Norms have been so broken that we’re asking whether we should praise people when the president is obviously trying to rig and steal the election.”

It remains to be seen if more moderate senior Republicans who have been critical of Trump, such as Mitt Romney, senator for Utah, will hold sway when the party plots its course for the Biden presidency.

Romney released a sternly worded statement on Friday that said Trump’s assertions the election was rigged, corrupt and stolen were wrong. “[It] damages the cause of freedom here and around the world, weakens the institutions that lie at the foundation of the Republic, and recklessly inflames destructive and dangerous passions,” he wrote.

Other Republican figures are still on board the Trump train, even as it jumps the rails, including the fiercely loyal DeSantis, Cruz, Cotton, the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham and apologists such as Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, and Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and Trump’s personal lawyer widely ridiculed for his appearance in the recent Borat movie.

All have backed the president’s false claims of malfeasance publicly, overlooking the fact they were made without evidence.

“Those are the most dangerous politicians we have. They have placed zero value on democracy,” Stanley, the Yale professor, said.

“Some of them, like Tom Cotton and Ted Cruz, you know, might be more dangerous in various respects than Trump.”"
Why Democrats lost Latino voters along Texas border: 'They relied on loyalty',['Alexandra Villarreal'],"While Democrats aggressively pushed to turn Texas blue this election cycle, they were banking on help from people like Barbara Ocañas, a highly educated, 37-year-old Latina voter from the Rio Grande valley.

But, after Donald Trump faced backlash for using the word “coyote” to describe human smugglers, Ocañas was turned off by liberals focused more on semantics than the actual realities of the migrant crisis affecting her home. As the daughter of a Mexican émigré, she believes that undocumented immigrants are “just people, like you and me”.

However, when it comes to earning US citizenship, “there is a right way and a wrong way to do it”, she said.

She also fears what Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s administration could mean for people she knows who rely on jobs in refineries or hauling crude oil. So, faced with a ballot and a choice, Ocañas decided she preferred four more years with Donald Trump in the White House.

“Not all of us take it to heart when we’re called rapists and bad hombres,” she said. “We have tough skin.”

Democrats have just assumed and relied on this historical loyalty by people in the valley to the Democratic party.

In Texas border towns with chronically low voter participation, residents did actually show up to the polls this election, exceeding county turnouts from 2016. But when results rolled in Tuesday night, Biden’s overall success was nowhere near Hillary Clinton’s slam dunk four years earlier, revealing Democratic vulnerabilities among a key bloc whose votes had largely been taken for granted.

“Democrats have just assumed and relied on this historical loyalty by people in the valley to the Democratic party,” said Natasha Altema McNeely, an associate professor of political science at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. “And that assumption, I think, is very dangerous for the Democrats if they expect to continue to help the valley remain blue.”

Biden still won Ocañas’s Hidalgo county, but with a fraction of the margin. In Starr county, which Clinton had dominated in a 60-point landslide, voters swung for Biden by just five points. And, after Democrats squandered a nearly 33-point advantage from four years ago, Zapata county flipped to deliver Trump a stunning victory.

That erosion of Democratic support took place even after high-profile Biden surrogates descended on the US-Mexico border ahead of election day. Jill Biden, Joe’s wife, campaigned in El Paso on the first day of early voting, when – amid buzz that Texas might be in play – she told her audience that a win in the state would mean that “we are unstoppable”.

Then, in an 11th-hour push to get out the vote, former presidential rivals Beto O’Rourke and Julián Castro joined forces with the vice-presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, in the valley last week. Harris had flown to south Texas, she said, “because there are people here who matter”.

Although residents in the valley lean left in terms of partisanship, “many people actually bleed red” ideologically, McNeely said. Some of that boils down to religious beliefs, with large contingents of Catholics and Protestant evangelicals in the area.

There’s also a pernicious machismo among some Latinos, so seeing a “strong man” may have driven enthusiasm for Trump, said Manuel Grajeda, the Texas strategist for civil rights and advocacy organization UnidosUS. To Ed Espinoza, executive director of the media non-profit Progress Texas, south Texas’s dramatic twist on election night looked “less like Latinos leaving Biden and more like rural voters flocking to Trump”.

But a potential surge in conservative values doesn’t fully explain why Democrats lost so much ground along the border. Going into the election, Texas Latinos were far less interested in social issues such as limiting abortion, and far more invested in policies around healthcare and the economy, according to the American election eve poll.

Above all else, they were concerned about the raging coronavirus pandemic, and negative reactions to hardline local Covid-19 restrictions may have at least partly contributed to Democrats’ lukewarm reception in the valley, McNeely suggested.

Although county governments there initially garnered positive national attention for their swift responses to the deadly virus, a continued push for protective measures after the state abruptly emerged from lockdown proved controversial among some residents. Commenters online criticized officials for what they saw as heavy-handed, overblown reactions to the pandemic, McNeely said, even as valley hospitals racked up a devastating body count.

Another potential factor is the sizable law enforcement presence in the valley and its surroundings, including officers with the federal government’s highly politicized border security agency. Ocañas, for example, views border patrol agents as protectors, not enemies, and she balked at the criticism they have faced on the job.

About three-quarters of valley residents oppose Trump’s pet project of a border wall, including Ocañas, who is well aware that it will do “absolutely nothing” to stop migrant crossings. But it does create jobs, she said, and as the Trump administration funds border enforcement, “I see more action.”

The prospect of a tax hike also soured Ocañas on the Biden-Harris ticket, a recurring theme among voters, Grajeda said, despite Biden assuring Americans that anyone who made less than $400,000 a year would not experience a tax increase under his leadership. Where Ocañas lives, the median household income was below $40,000 in recent years.

At the end of the day, Ocañas said, liberal Democrats just fundamentally misunderstand Latino voters – and talk down to them, “almost like we’re stupid, almost like we’re children”. Although she’s tried to have conversations with people “on the other side” of the political debate, she has been called straight-out crazy and a race traitor to her face.

Victoria M DeFrancesco Soto, an assistant dean at the University of Texas’s LBJ school of public affairs, hypothesized on election night that the lack of old-fashioned, grassroots organizing because of Covid-19 might have played a part in Biden’s underperformance in the Valley.

But the pandemic didn’t stop caravans of Trump supporters from boisterously rallying around south Texas for months leading up to election day, a harbinger of what was to come.

“I think people who were excited to vote for Trump are just a lot more excited to do that than a lot of people who would turn out for Biden,” Grajeda said. “And I think the people who are most excited to turn out for Biden are middle-upper-class, white people.”"
Joe Biden poised to inherit Disunited States of America,['Ed Pilkington'],"“Tomorrow is the beginning of a new day,” Joe Biden said in his final campaign rally in Pittsburgh on the eve of the US election. “There’s one more day to show who we are as a country: looking out for each other, the thousand acts of kindness, the decency that people used to show one another – and still do.”

Three days later, Donald Trump appeared in the press briefing room of the White House and let the world know what he thinks of kindness and decency. With votes still being counted, he laid out a paranoid fantasy of a vast leftwing conspiracy stealing the election from him, one fraudulent ballot at a time.

For the media networks who cut away from Trump’s speech after just a few minutes, it was all too easy to dismiss his lie-infested rant as the death rattle of a man whose political lifeblood was being drained from him in real time. You could almost say his speech was irrelevant, given that no one is above the law and he doesn’t get to choose, no matter how charismatic he looks on TV.

Except for three inconvenient truths: Trump will continue to be head of state of the most powerful nation on Earth until at least 20 January; 70 million Americans voted for him, of whom a portion is likely to be susceptible to his falsehoods; some 17m guns have been bought so far this year – the largest number in US history.

Nor did this outpouring of baseless histrionics end with the president. The rightwing talkshow host Mark Levin called on Republican state lawmakers to bypass the vote entirely and declare Trump the winner no matter what the final count.

Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist in the White House now facing charges for running a fraudulent scheme to build the Mexican border wall, told Fox News: “Donald Trump won an overwhelming victory on Tuesday night. It’s now time to be bold, we have got to stop playing games here.”

A few hours later Facebook permanently suspended one of Bannon’s accounts after he suggested senior members of the Trump administration should be beheaded. Facebook also banned a group, “Stop the Steal”, that popped up on its platform attracting within the first 24 hours some 350,000 members, a number of whom made “worrying calls for violence”.

Joe Biden, assuming he is declared the next occupant of the Oval Office, is going to have to climb a steep and stony path before he can drag America back to anything resembling decency.

For a moment it looked almost promising. Election day itself went more smoothly than many had expected, with little of the militia activity and intimidation that was hovering so menacingly in the wings.

But in the days since, during the agonizingly prolonged period of counting, more ominous signs emerged. Trump supporters assembled in large crowds outside vote-counting centres in Phoenix, Arizona, and Detroit, Michigan, some bearing firearms.

It’s enough to generate the sense of a nation teetering on the edge. Human rights groups, whose focus normally falls on the likes of Myanmar or Saudi Arabia, are paying close attention.

“It’s a very serious situation and it is getting worse,” said Bob Goodfellow, interim executive director of Amnesty International USA. “We are worried about the immediate coming days, which are likely to be volatile.”

Amnesty research has found a steady escalation in political violence in the US. Between May and September, the human rights watchdog documented confrontations between protesters and counter-protests in 37 of the 50 states.

The group is especially concerned about Trump’s incendiary language as he attempts to cling to power. “We see President Trump continually engaging in rhetoric that threatens public safety and facilitates violence,” Goodfellow said.

The movement is much larger than Donald Trump. The neocon establishment Republicans who think they will take control of the GOP are dreaming

As Biden contemplates forming an administration, he has more to worry about than just the next few days. There’s also the sobering prospect of Trumpism living on even beyond its creator.

The adoration that Trump has instilled in his millions of supporters, the fervor with which many appear to have bought his demagoguery and misinformation, are forces that show no sign of abating. The extraordinarily close outcome of the race in so many critical battleground states can only fire those emotions.

The Guardian asked Roger Stone what he thought would become of the Maga movement under a Biden presidency. Would it fade away?

Stone has skin in this game, it should be noted. In July his longtime friend, Trump, commuted his sentence for obstructing a congressional investigation.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest A woman and her dog watch the sun rise on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on Wednesday in Washington DC. Photograph: Al Drago/Getty Images

He is also legendary for the political dirty tricks he has pioneered since he began working as a teenager for Richard Nixon in the early 1970s (he has a tattoo of Nixon on his back). He can also claim to be the source of the rallying cry now being deployed by Trump – “Stop the Steal” – which Stone coined back in 2016 as an attempt allegedly to intimidate minority voters during the battle with Hillary Clinton.

But Stone is also a seasoned observer of rightwing political machinations, and as such is a credible analyst of what might become of the red-capped Trump fanatics. Far from disappearing, he believes, they are going to be encouraged and emboldened whatever the next few days and weeks might bring.

“The movement is much larger than Donald Trump. The neocon establishment Republicans who think they will take control of the GOP are dreaming,” he said.

Stone went on: “Donald Trump’s movement is stronger than ever. It is going to thrive, and the fight to make America great again is going to continue.”

That’s a chilling prospect for a nascent Biden presidency. The Democrats are already having to digest the likelihood that they have failed to flip the US Senate, pending the outcome of two possible runoff elections in Georgia in January.

Unless they win both those long-shot races, the Senate will probably be left in the deadeningly obstructionist hands of the Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell. As Biden knows well from his eight years alongside Barack Obama, McConnell – dubbed the “Grim Reaper” for his impact on legislation – delights in nothing more than stymying Democratic presidents at every turn.

David French, a prominent Republican critic of Trump, wrote in the Dispatch: “The underlying disease of American division and polarization remains. If anything, a divided government will cause it to intensify.”

That’s the rosy prospect that lies ahead as Joe Biden inches ever closer to the highest office. A bright future looks within his grasp as president of the Disunited States of America."
Georgia announces recount after presidential race too close to call,['Miranda Bryant'],"Election officials in Georgia announced a recount on Friday after the presidential race was deemed “too close to call” in that state.

Joe Biden overtook Donald Trump in Georgia, historically a Republican stronghold, at around 4.30am ET to secure a lead of 1,579 votes.

Trump and Biden were locked in a tight contest on Friday, with the Democrat edging ahead, to get the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. For Trump, Georgia is a state he must win.

But with such a razor-thin margin, Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, said ballots will undergo a recount.

“Right now, Georgia remains too close to call. Of approximately 5m votes cast, we’ll have a margin of a few thousand,” he said in a press conference. He added: “With a margin that small, there will be a recount in Georgia.”

If Biden goes on to win Georgia, it would mark a major victory for the Democrats – and a huge upset for the Republicans – in a state that has been reliably Republican for decades.

The last time a Democratic presidential nominee won in the state was Bill Clinton in 1992. In 2016, Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Georgia by five percentage points.

Raffensperger acknowledged that Georgia’s result has “huge implications for the entire country” and officials said the unofficial tally could be completed by the end of the weekend.



He added: “The stakes are high and emotions are high on all sides. We will not let those debates distract us from our work. We will get it right, and we will defend the integrity of our elections.”

Georgia does not run automatic recounts, but candidates can request them if the margin is within 0.5%.

Meanwhile, two closely watched Senate races in the state will head to a runoff, keeping alive Democrats’ hopes of possibly gaining control of the Senate.

The incumbent Republican senator David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff will rematch on 5 January, after neither candidate met the 50% threshold for an outright victory.

Georgia’s other Senate seat will also be decided in a runoff, between Democrat Raphael Warnock and the Republican senator Kelly Loeffler.

Nationally, the Senate stands at 48-48. But Republicans lead uncalled races in Alaska and North Carolina, so the ultimate balance is likely to come down to what happens in the Georgia runoffs.

The announcement of a recount came after a judge dismissed a lawsuit from the Trump campaign over the state’s handling of absentee ballots in Chatham county.

The Trump campaign has launched a swath of legal cases across the country, which are largely intended as a distraction and are founded on weak legal arguments, experts say.

Trump's lawsuits are diversionary tactic with little legal basis, experts say Read more

Matt Morgan, the general counsel for the Trump campaign, said on Friday: “Georgia is headed for a recount, where we are confident we will find ballots improperly harvested, and where President Trump will ultimately prevail.”

Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s voting system implementation manager, dismissed allegations of fraud, saying: “We’re not seeing any widespread irregularities.”



Sterling said that 4,169 ballots, most of which were absentee, were left to be counted from four counties, including Gwinnett county, which includes Atlanta suburbs and in recent years has shifted towards Democrats.



The state also has an unknown quantity of military and overseas ballots and an unknown number of provisional ballots to be “cured”.

Biden’s strength in Georgia is the result of strong turnout among Black voters in the Atlanta suburbs, which have become younger and increasingly diverse.

The Black Voters Matter Fund, a non-profit that advocates for increasing voter registration and access, hailed the impact of Black voters in Georgia, who they said “saved the election”.

They said more than a million Black voters cast their ballots early in the state – exceeding 2016 numbers – and reported a “surge” in registration and turnout among young Black voters.

Co-founders LaTosha Brown and Cliff Albright said: “A new south is rising, and Georgia is the beacon … Georgia is at the epicenter of this country right now and we are claiming victory.”

It is also a product of the work of figures such Stacey Abrams, who since losing the state’s 2018 race for governor has thrown her efforts into Fair Fight, an organization she founded that focuses on combating voter suppression.

According to electoral research by the Associated Press, there have been at least 31 statewide recounts since 2000, of which three changed the outcome of an election. But in those the initial margins were even slimmer – in the low hundreds rather than thousands.

Many analysts believe Georgia’s shift to becoming a swing state is almost inevitable – an assessment that is reflected in the energies invested into the state by the Biden campaign.

In the final weeks before the election, Biden, his running mate Senator Kamala Harris and former president Barack Obama all paid visits. Trump also rallied there.

“Can you believe it? Two days from now, we’re going to win this state again and we’re going to win four more great years in the White House,” Trump told supporters in the Georgia city of Rome on Sunday.

What's happening in Pennsylvania? The state that may be about to tip the US election

Joe Biden appeared to be on the verge of victory in the US presidential election on Friday morning, passing Donald Trump in the vote tally in the key state of Pennsylvania.

Would a Pennsylvania win absolutely make Biden president-elect?

Yes, it would. A win in Pennsylvania would bring Biden to 284 electoral votes, beyond the 270 threshold needed to win. He would not need to win any further states, and he could even afford to lose Arizona (11 electoral votes), where the margin separating the candidates has narrowed after an early call in Biden’s favor.

Why hasn’t the race been called?

It might be called at any moment. At least one high-profile election decisions clearinghouse, Decisions Desk HQ, had already declared Biden to be president-elect. The thousands of votes remaining to be counted in Pennsylvania were coming from heavily Democratic areas, and Biden’s lead in the state was expected to grow.

The major television networks and the Associated Press, on whose decision desk the Guardian relies, were expected to declare victory for Biden after an anticipated growth in his lead in Pennsylvania to somewhere beyond half a percentage point.

Biden could be summarily declared president-elect at any moment.

“The Associated Press continues to count votes in the presidential election and has not declared a winner,” the news organization said at just after noon eastern time.

When will the race be called?

At the rate Pennsylvania has been counting, Biden is likely to grow a significant lead over the course of the day on Friday, and the race might be called at any time.

Does Trump still have a path?

Not really. If Trump loses Pennsylvania, he loses the election. Trump is now behind in Pennsylvania, and the votes remaining to be counted come from areas where Biden has been getting 75% of the vote or better. The more votes are counted, the greater Biden’s lead becomes.

Can Trump do anything to stop this?

It’s an extreme long shot. The Trump campaign is pursuing lawsuits in multiple states in an attempt to have various batches of ballots thrown out. For example, Trump has joined a case before the supreme court that could potentially reverse a decision allowing ballots received after election day in Pennsylvania (but postmarked by election day) to be counted.

The problem for Trump is that most of the legal claims his team is advancing appear to be weak, and several have already been thrown out of court. Another problem for Trump: the total number of ballots challenged by his lawsuits does not appear to be anywhere close to large enough to flip the result in any state.

The Trump campaign has said it will formally request a recount in Wisconsin and may do so in other states, but recounts in major US elections rarely move the tally by more than a few hundred votes, not nearly enough to make a difference.

What other variables are in play?

The basic point to understand is that every last avenue to re-election for Trump has been pretty much closed off. But because it’s Trump, who appears ready to try anything to stay in power, the question is worth exploring.

The multi-stage nature of the electoral college, in which voters in each state pick a winner and then state legislatures appoint “electors” who cast 538 total ballots for president, could allow some opportunity for foul play, although it’s extremely unlikely.

There has been some wild talk among some Republicans about trying to get a Republican-controlled legislature in a state such as Pennsylvania to ignore the will of the voters and appoint a slate of electors that favors Trump instead of Biden. The Republican leaders of both chambers of the state legislature, however, have adamantly knocked down the idea.

Trump has loudly called on supporters to “defend” the election, and some have brought guns to rallies outside ballot-counting sites. It’s not clear how such tensions might develop as the realization of Trump’s probable loss sinks in.

The attorney general, William Barr, has been wholly offstage since before election day. It’s possible that Trump’s justice department could yet make some kind of coordinated legal play against the election.

But owing to the decentralized nature of US elections, that would be exceedingly difficult. Unlike in the 2000 election, when the entire race came down to one state, Florida, and a legal challenge by Republicans succeeded in halting a recount, this year there are multiple states contributing to a Biden victory and he does not need a recount to win."
Why is the Nevada vote count taking so long?,['Guardian Staff'],"Slow pace of vote-counting has spawned a whole genre of memes, but government officials say they are emphasizing accuracy over speed

The pace of vote-counting in Nevada is being criticized for taking too long – so long that it has become a target of a whole genre of memes. But government officials say they are emphasizing accuracy over speed in a year when processing an unprecedented flood of mail-in ballots under extended deadlines is taking more time.

“We told everyone early on that results would take at least 10 days,” Secretary of State spokeswoman Jennifer A. Russell said in an email.

How it started

The Legislature passed a bill in August to send all active voters mail-in ballots in hopes of curbing, or at least not fueling, the spread of the coronavirus. Those postmarked by Election Day can be counted if they arrive at election offices within seven days, which is Tuesday. And they continue to come in, though the number arriving each day is expected to dwindle.

“It’s been a different year for us,” said Deanna Spikula, registrar of voters in Washoe County, the state’s second-largest county that includes Reno. “The volume is definitely something that we’ve never seen before in the state as far as receiving and processing mail-in ballots.”

Where we stand

The Associated Press has not declared a winner in the state. More than 1.2 million ballots had been counted by Friday afternoon, with Joe Biden holding a 22,657-vote lead over President Donald Trump — an edge of about 1.8 points. About 87% of the estimated vote has been tallied, but tens of thousands of votes remain uncounted statewide.

The vast majority of those untallied ballots are in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas and its populous surrounding suburbs. Clark County Registrar Joe Gloria said on Friday that outstanding votes fell into several categories, each requiring multi-step verification to ensure the integrity of the election.

The process

Most of the still-to-be counted ballots arrived by mail, and are first processed through a machine that verifies signatures. Election staff manually examines signatures not verified by the machine. Later, a review is done to make sure the total number of ballots processed matches the number of ballots received. Once verified, those ballots are counted.

As of Thursday, an additional 44,000 ballots required ID verification, and 2,100 others had signature-match problems. The registrar’s office reaches out to voters in both groups to verify their eligibility to vote, which again takes time.

The timeline

Gloria said he expected the majority of the remaining ballots to be counted by Sunday. The Legislature gave election officials until November 12 to finish counting votes, and Gloria said staff intended to work until then to resolve ballot issues.

In Washoe County, the registrar’s office said it had no backlog or other problems with vote-counting. Along with counting mail ballots as they arrive, the county has about 5,100 provisional and same-day registration ballots that need to be counted. About 1,800 others have signature issues, which the agency is attempting to resolve with the voters.

Processing mail-in ballots takes longer, but “we haven’t had any hiccups, we haven’t had any delays,” said spokeswoman Bethany Drysdale.

“As much as everybody wants an answer right now, we won’t have that until every ballot is counted,” she added."
When will we know the US election result – and why the delay?,"['Jon Henley', 'Helen Sullivan', 'Tom Mccarthy']","Five states have yet to be called, and the refusal of some Republican-led state legislatures to allow early processing is partly to blame

When will we know the US election result – and why the delay?

Donald Trump’s repeated claims to have won the US presidential election while votes remain to be counted have focused the spotlight once more on one of the big uncertainties of the 2020 race: when will we know the final result?

It could take days, weeks or even months, depending on what happens.

What usually happens?

US presidential elections are not won by the national popular vote. The winner in each state collects its electoral college votes – and needs a total of 270 to take the White House.

US election 2020 results live: Biden narrowly ahead of Trump as count continues Read more

In most elections the result is clear – although not officially confirmed – by the end of the night. Major American media outlets “call” each state for one of the candidates. While not based on the final vote count, that projection is almost invariably accurate.

This means an accurate tally of electoral college votes can be made and a winner declared. In 2016, that happened at 2.30am in Washington when Trump reached the required 270.

Why is that not happening this time?

Mainly because of the Covid-19 pandemic, large numbers of voters – about 68% of the total, compared with 34% in 2016 – cast their ballots early, including by post.

Counting postal votes is slower because voter and witness signatures and addresses must be checked, and ballots smoothed out before being fed into counting machines. Some states start that verification process long before election day, meaning the count itself can get under way as soon as polls close.

There was no early processing in multiple key battleground states this year, however, because Republican-led state legislatures refused urgent requests from local elections officials to pass new laws to allow extra time for ballot processing. Such a refusal in Pennsylvania produced enormous backlogs in cities such as Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, which has gone from counting about 6,000 mail-in ballots in 2016 to more than 350,000 this year.

Which states are we talking about?

Five states have yet to be called: Alaska, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Several news organizations, including the Associated Press and Fox News’ decision desk, have called Arizona for Joe Biden. The Trump campaign is arguing, however, that call was made too early.

Alaska will end up in the Republican column with near certainty.

The race is extremely tight in Georgia, where a recount has been announced by its secretary of state. Biden pulled ahead of Trump by 1,097 votes on Friday morning, with 99% of votes reported.

The Democratic challenger is ahead in Nevada, with only Democratic-leaning late postal ballots left to tally. But by state law, ballots postmarked on election day can be counted as long as they are received by 5pm on 10 November, which means counting in the state could continue through the weekend.

In North Carolina, while Trump is the clear favourite, the state accepts postal ballots until 12 November – although that is expected to make little difference. State officials have said a full result would not be known until next week.

Biden took the lead in Pennsylvania on Friday morning. He’s been winning the mail-in ballot counts by huge margins, and could very well take the state. Pennsylvania officials had expected to count most votes by the end of Friday, but the process was continuing into Saturday with Biden’s lead widening.

What else is complicating matters?

Roughly half of all states will accept postal votes that arrive after election day as long as they carry a postmark of no later than 3 November, so postal delays may mean some ballots are not processed until days later: Pennsylvania has said results will not be considered complete until the deadline of Friday.

There has also reportedly been an increase in the number of provisional ballots cast by people who asked for a postal vote but then decided to go to the polling station in person instead. These need careful checking to make sure no one has voted twice.

The really big unknown: a disputed result

In the 2000 race, the Democratic candidate, Al Gore, famously lost Florida by just more than 500 votes out of a total of nearly 6m, costing him the election. After a disputed recount and a supreme court ruling, George W Bush was declared the winner.

More than 300 lawsuits have already been filed over alleged breaches of electoral law in the 2020 election, according to reports, and more can be expected over accusations of postal voting irregularities and changes to voting rules due to the pandemic.

Trump and his campaign have this week already sued to halt vote-counting in Pennsylvania and Georgia (which have not yet been called by Associated Press) and Michigan, which the AP called for Biden. Judges in Georgia and Michigan quickly dismissed the campaign’s lawsuits on Thursday.

Trump’s campaign has also requested a recount in Wisconsin, which AP called for Biden.

There is no evidence the campaign’s legal challenges will have a bearing on the election result under the law."
Why are the media reporting different US election results?,['Martin Belam'],"As the US election slowly draws to its conclusion, one of the areas of confusion is that different media outlets are showing different results for the electoral votes.

The president is elected by winning at least 270 electoral college votes, not the outcome of the popular vote. Because there is no centralised federal election system, it has become tradition in the US that “decision desks” at media organisations make a call that states have been won by one candidate or the other when enough votes have been counted. States that are too close to call – such as Nevada and Georgia at the moment – remain in the balance until a network “calls” them.

The Guardian uses the data collected and analysed by the Associated Press (AP) news agency as the source for when we will call election results. There are a number of other highly reputable election decision desks in US media, including NBC, Fox News and others. They may call races earlier or later than AP. US networks obviously use the decisions from their own desks – other channels may chose to follow one, or wait for two desks to call a state before they count it.

This year, Arizona has brought this into sharp relief. Our current total of 264 electoral votes for Joe Biden includes the fact that AP has called Arizona for the Democratic nominee. So have Fox News – attracting the ire of the Trump campaign. Not all decision desks have yet.

AP has issued this guide to all of the states it has called. This is what it says about Arizona:

The AP called the race at 2.50am EST Wednesday, after an analysis of ballots cast statewide concluded there were not enough outstanding to allow Trump to catch up. With 80% of the expected vote counted, Biden was ahead by 5 percentage points, with a roughly 130,000-vote lead over Trump, with about 2.6m ballots counted. The remaining ballots left to be counted, including mail-in votes in Maricopa county, where Biden performed strongly, were not enough for Trump to catch up to the former vice-president.

The Trump campaign disagrees. Biden’s lead is currently down to about 68,000 votes in the state – or less than three percentage points – with 88% of the votes counted."
Mail-in ballot tracker: counting election votes in US swing states,"['Juweek Adolphe', 'Alvin Chang']","This piece is published in partnership with ProPublica, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive their biggest stories as soon as they’re published

An unprecedented number of Americans have voted by mail this year to avoid Covid-19 risk. Joe Biden’s supporters said they were more likely to vote by mail while Donald Trump’s supporters said they were more likely to vote in person. With postal delays, rejected ballots and a dearth of funding, the process isn’t always smooth – ballots can be rejected for multiple reasons, and due to court challenges, election rules are changing even while voting is underway. Meanwhile, Trump and other Republican officials have spent the last months casting doubt on the mail-in voting process, paving the way for legal battles during the vote count.

With data from University of Florida political science professor Michael McDonald, the Guardian and ProPublica are tracking votes in politically competitive states through the election to find out how many people are voting by mail, how their votes are counted, and what it means for the 2020 election. Our tracker will be updated as we obtain updated information, as well as other state data. We will also be investigating any aberrations and issues in the mail-in voting process as we find them, and telling the stories of the people and communities affected most.

Georgia

16 electoral votes

Democrats believe Joe Biden may be able to win a state long seen as a Republican bastion, which would be a coup for the campaign. More people have already returned their ballots than voted by mail in total in 2016. The state has thousands of outstanding ballots to count, and liberal cities like Atlanta are expected to skew more towards Biden. Voters must return their ballots to election offices by election day in order to have them counted.

Wisconsin

10 electoral votes

Trump won Wisconsin in 2016 by fewer than 23,000 votes, a year when voter turnout in key cities such as Milwaukee was also low. This year, voting rights groups are pushing the state to count ballots if they are postmarked by election day but arrive afterward. Currently, mail-in ballots must be received by 3 November at 8pm.

Pennsylvania

20 electoral votes

Home to some of the most intense legal battles of the election, the state where Joe Biden was born could be the deciding factor in 2020. Pennsylvania had been a Democratic stronghold for six presidential elections until Trump carried the state by 0.7% in 2016. It’s very possible that the election result in Pennsylvania will not be known for days. That’s because Philadelphia, the state’s biggest city, could take days to count its mail-in ballots, according to officials there. Ballots must be postmarked by election day and received by 6 November at 5pm to be counted.

Florida

29 electoral votes

Few states were more important on election night than Florida, where Trump has already been projected the winner. Voters must return their ballots to election offices by 7pm on election night to have them counted. Local election officials are required to contact voters if the signature on their ballot does not match the one on file.

North Carolina

15 electoral votes

A battleground state Donald Trump carried in 2016, North Carolina is in the spotlight for being still too close to call. The state has seen an unprecedented surge in mail-in voting, not typically used widely in the state. Ballots must be postmarked by election day and received no later than 12 November at 5pm.

Michigan

16 electoral votes

Michigan is one of the midwestern states that offer a clear path of victory for Joe Biden. The state has seen a massive change in voting procedures since 2016, including a constitutional amendment that gives everyone in the state the right to vote by mail without an excuse. Ballots must be postmarked by election day and received that day by 8pm.

Ohio

18 electoral votes

Trump won the swing state easily in 2016, and was declared the projected winner on Tuesday night. Mail-in ballots must be postmarked by 2 November, or in person on election day, and received by 13 November at 7.30pm.

Iowa

Six electoral votes

Donald Trump won Iowa on election night, while Democrats failed to oust the first-term GOP senator Joni Ernst. Anyone in Iowa is eligible to vote by mail and must return their ballot to election officials by the close of the polls on election day to have it counted.

Minnesota

10 electoral votes

Trump claimed he could win Minnesota this year, though he lost the reliable blue state in 2016 by 1.5%, because of rural voters who favor the president. But after police killed the unarmed Black man George Floyd in the state earlier this year, it also launched the biggest protest movement and civil unrest in decades – a factor that could play into voter turnout. Ballots must be postmarked by 3 November, and received by 10 November."
Rudy Giuliani: from hero of 9/11 to leader of Trump's last stand,['Archie Bland'],"On election night, as it started to become clear that the presidency was slipping away from Donald Trump, his son-in-law and senior aide Jared Kushner was looking for a hero.

He wanted someone like James Baker, the New York Times reported, the former White House chief of staff, Treasury secretary and secretary of state, who led George W Bush’s legal team during the Florida recount in 2000 in a role that won him praise as a strategic and diplomatic genius.

He got Rudy Giuliani.

A fortnight ago, Giuliani was angrily defending himself after a clip from the new Borat film showed him apparently fiddling with his crotch as he lay on the bed in a hotel room where he had gone for a drink with a young woman who was posing as a Kazakh television journalist. “I was tucking in my shirt,” he explained later. He denied any wrongdoing and described the footage as “complete fabrication”.

Now the president’s personal attorney is accusing his opponents of being “an embarrassment to our reputation throughout the world” and leading Trump’s last stand, helming the legal effort to keep Joe Biden out of the White House.

On Wednesday afternoon he tweeted that he was “en route to Philadelphia with legal team” to challenge what he called – without offering any evidence – “massive cheating”. Since then, six of his tweets have been flagged by Twitter as containing misleading information.

At a press conference on Thursday, he gave a speech in which he claimed – again without providing evidence - that one person could have voted 100,000 times. Giuliani, with no neck and a pocket square, declared his interest in launching a nebulous “national lawsuit” to challenge the results. “Do you think we’re stupid?” he asked. “Do you think we’re fools?”

His attempts to keep Trump in the White House, if they result in failure as most experts seem to think they will, may mark some sort of end point for the 76-year-old Giuliani, once a fearless criminal prosecutor and hero of 9/11 who few people disputed had earned his honorary knighthood and the title of America’s Mayor.

Three months after the twin towers fell, he completed his term in New York and embarked on a highly lucrative career on the speaking circuit, commanding as much as $200,000 per engagement, for each of which his contract demanded transportation in the form of a private jet that “MUST BE a Gulfstream IV or bigger”.

Over the next six years he brought in about $30m, was a member of 11 country clubs and had six homes.

A run at the presidency seemed the next obvious step. But after a vastly expensive campaign for the Republican nomination ended with just a single delegate to his name, something shifted in public perceptions of Giuliani, perhaps nudged along by Biden’s timeless summary on the campaign trail: “There’s only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, a verb, and 9/11.” Giuliani never forgot that slight, it is said.

Those closest to him noticed a change, too. Judith Nathan, his third ex-wife, told New York magazine in 2018 that the end of their marriage was “an ongoing process that began when he lost the presidential campaign. For a variety of reasons that I know as a spouse and a nurse, he has become a different man.”

Trump’s campaign for the presidency offered a chance at reinvention, and Giuliani secured for himself a role that Chris Christie, formerly a Trump confidante himself, summarised as “first friend”. When the Access Hollywood tape in which Trump boasted about sexual assault came out, surrogates and supporters began to melt away. Only Giuliani was prepared to defend him, appearing on every one of the five prominent Sunday morning talkshows that set the US political agenda. “This is talk, and gosh almighty, he who hasn’t sinned, throw the first stone here,” he said.

Steve Bannon, then Trump’s chief strategist, later described his role as indispensable. “One of the reasons we won is Rudy was there 24/7,” Bannon says. “Rudy was hardcore. He’s like a honey badger. ”

Giuliani was denied the reward he coveted as secretary of state, instead settling definitively into Trump’s personal orbit as his fixer and fireman, wholly reconciled to the accompanying loss of dignity.

In 1993, when the New York Times called him a “jutjawed lawman” whose “cultural and psychic sensibilities froze in about 1961”, he refused to let Trump buy him breakfast for fear of an appearance of impropriety. By 2019, he was acting as the president’s unpaid personal attorney, a gift that went undeclared.

He has also advised the president on the legality of his “Muslim ban” and as a “cybersecurity adviser”. Most notorious was his leading role in Trump’s attempt to dredge up a scandal about the Biden family in Ukraine – a role that led career diplomats to accuse him during the impeachment hearings of conducting a “shadow foreign policy”. He has appeared in ads for Cigar Aficionado magazine and seen his own daughter endorse Biden.

Assuming the failure of his so far eccentric legal representations, he now looks bound for a return to the peanut gallery. If such a welcome is all that is left to him in the city he once led, how will he feel?

Relaxed, he has claimed. “My attitude about my legacy is ‘fuck it’,” he said last year. In any case, he insists, he will be remembered fondly in the end. “I will be the hero,” he said during the Ukraine affair. ‘These morons – when this is over, I will be the hero.”"
Getting rid of Trump won't be enough to fix America's broken democracy,[],"The good news is that Donald Trump appears to be on the cusp of being voted out of the White House. The bad news is that Trump was not a unique, aberrant threat to American democracy; it was already broken so deeply and in so many ways that no single election can possibly repair the damage.

Even with a Biden administration, the worsening structural inequities embedded in the nation for centuries – and cynically exploited by Republicans to govern with narrow minority support – will still be with us. They are embodied in institutions such as the electoral college, which elected Trump in 2016 despite his losing the popular vote by almost 3 million votes.

In fact, including Biden, the Democratic candidate for president has won the popular vote in seven of the last eight elections. But in part because of the electoral college’s rural bias (a vote cast for president in Wyoming counts nearly four times as much as a vote cast in California), and in part because the college heightens the importance of a handful of largely white, midwestern battleground states, Republicans have won the White House with fewer votes twice since 2000.

Representational fairness is even more dire in the US Senate, which gives disproportionate power to older, whiter, more rural and more conservative interests. Right now, states representing just 17% of the nation’s population could elect a majority of senators. By 2040, the 15 most populous states will be home to 67% of Americans yet represented by just 30% of the Senate. Add up the actual votes received in the winning election of every sitting US senator, and Republicans haven’t won a senate majority since the mid-1990s. Yet they’ve controlled the Senate for 10 of the last 20 years, and used that advantage to shape the ideological balance on the federal courts.

By taking advantage of American democracy’s design flaws, Republicans secured an edge. State legislatures and the courts helped make it stick. After Barack Obama and the Democrats swept elections in 2008, Republicans identified another tactic that could be exploited as a path back to power: redistricting.

Every state legislature and congressional district is redrawn every 10 years, after the census, to account for population changes. In almost every state, state legislatures draw these lines. As part of a $30m Republican strategy called Redmap, Republicans identified 107 key state legislative seats across 16 states that would give them complete control of the process in the most important swing states: Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. They won, and then drew themselves sophisticated maps that they have not lost on since: More than 50 million Americans live in a state in which one or both chambers of their state legislature is controlled by Republicans even though Democrats won more votes in 2018. And in the 2012 election, the first on these tilted maps, Republicans kept the House of Representatives despite losing the overall vote to Democrats by 1.4m.

In 2013, a 5-4 supreme court decision undid the “pre-clearance” protections of the Voting Rights Act, designed to check localities with a history of racial prejudice in voting laws. Chief Justice John Roberts argued that those voting protections were in response to “eradicated practices.” “Today the nation is no longer divided along those lines,” he argued, “yet the Voting Rights Act continues to treat it as if it were.”

This magically changed and racially harmonious nation then embarked on an orgy of voter suppression, largely aimed at disenfranchising Black and Latino voters.

Gerrymandered legislatures led the way. State Republicans rigged rules and entrenched themselves in power. Twenty-five states enacted restrictive voter identification (ID) bills or tightened measures already in place. Texas required ID that the state knew 600,000 registered Latino voters lacked. North Carolina’s legislature studied the exact forms of ID that Black voters were least likely to have, then required those. Alabama began enforcing a strict ID bill; then, in 2015, closed almost all of the offices in majority black counties where people could get those IDs. And Wisconsin’s new law may have prevented 300,000 people from voting, a federal court found, in a state Trump carried by a margin of less than 25,000 in 2016.

The rot runs deep. Trump is responsible for only a small piece of this

Between 2014 and 2018, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, 32 million Americans were purged from state voter rolls, disproportionately minority voters, for the flimsiest of reasons. Thousands of voting precincts were also shuttered, predominantly across the south. Once again, this disproportionately affected Black voters.

In some cases, citizens have organized heroic efforts to undo racist voter suppression and gerrymandering – only to see their own courts and legislatures override them. In Florida, a referendum to restore voting rights to 1.4 million formerly incarcerated citizens – people who lost the franchise permanently with a conviction, a cruel vestige of the Jim Crow South still with us 150 years after the Civil War – won in 2018 with almost 65% of the vote. In response, Florida’s gerrymandered legislature passed a law requiring all fines and fees associated with the conviction to be paid first. It was essentially a modern poll tax, and the courts went right along with it.

During this election, a record number of Americans voted early, by mail, or braved hours-long lines amid a pandemic to vote. Here, too, they had to battle their own government and courts, which worked in tandem to slow the mails and enforce rigid deadlines on when ballots must arrive to be counted.

Trump is responsible for only a small piece of this. American democracy will survive only if his party decides to walk away from these suppression tactics and compete for every vote in a multi-racial America. Perhaps this defeat will encourage that. Or maybe Republicans will take the same lesson they did from their 2008 walloping and double down, knowing they will be backed by courts packed with ideological true believers.

Trump may have lost, but the Texas governor who limited ballot dropboxes to one per county isn’t going anywhere. Nor are his congressional colleagues, who refused to fully fund the postal service amid expanded pandemic mail-in voting. And what about the Wisconsin state legislators who forced voters to the polls in-person this spring during coronavirus? Or the Republican officials who refused to begin processing millions of mail-in ballots early, enabling Trump to try to paint mail ballots as somehow fraudulent?

These past months have exposed the frailty of a system that relies on norms and responsible behavior from its leaders. These guardrails are more rickety than imagined.

Democracy reform must be job one for the Biden administration and its congressional allies, if he does clinch the presidency. There is a strong bill – the For The People Act – ready and waiting. Yet it would be naive to imagine many of those reforms would be allowed by this supreme court, which means that court reform must go hand in hand with our efforts to fix democracy.

The rot runs deep. A country that proclaims itself the greatest democracy in the world has an awful lot of work to do."
Democrats beware: the Republicans will soon be the party of the working class,['Samuel Hammond'],"Following an election mired in chaos and confusion, this at least is clear: Donald Trump’s political career will soon be coming to an end, but Trumpism – his inchoate brand of conservative populism – is here to stay.

The narrative would surely be different had Trump lost in the resounding landslide foreseen by professional pundits and pollsters. In that universe, the president and everything he represents would have been repudiated, creating an immense temptation for the Republican party to revert back to its lily-white, elite-driven comfort zone.

Instead, Trump defied expectations by winning the largest share of non-white voters of any Republican since 1960. This ranged from modest gains among African American men, to major swings in party preference within working-class Latino communities – and not just in Miami-Dade, where Cuban-American turnout helped secure Florida for Trump while unseating two Democratic incumbents. In Starr county, Texas, for example, Biden beat Trump by five points down from Hillary Clinton’s 60 – a 55-point swing in a border town that’s 95% Hispanic and which has a median income of only $17,000.

The Missouri senator Josh Hawley, a rising star within the GOP’s populist faction, was quick to offer his interpretation on Twitter. “Republicans in Washington are going to have a very hard time processing this,” he wrote. “But the future is clear: we must be a working class party, not a Wall Street party.”

The Florida senator Marco Rubio concurred. “#Florida & the Rio Grande Valley showed the future of the GOP: A party built on a multi-ethnic multi-racial coalition of working AMERICANS.”

Ironically enough, the primary demographic Trump lost relative to 2016 was non-college-educated white men. A key factor seems to have been the Biden campaign’s strategic positioning on issues that resonate with rust belt voters – from a “Buy America” plan so supercharged that it made Steve Bannon blush, to tax incentives for manufacturers that reshore. Thus even in defeat, the ideas behind Trumpism were on some level victorious.

All that said, the gap between Trumpism in theory and practice remains enormous. Despite campaigning on a rejection of conservative economic orthodoxies in 2016, once in office Trump pursued an agenda of tax cuts and deregulation that was almost comically conventional. And by the final days of the 2020 campaign, Trump scarcely talked about policy at all, much less his core issues of trade and immigration.

Trump’s narrow loss thus marks the beginning of an internal struggle for the soul of American conservatism

Trump’s narrow loss thus marks the beginning of an internal struggle for the soul of American conservatism. Many in the Republican party long for a return to the socially moderate, fiscal conservatism of a bygone era. Others, like Hawley and Rubio, are calling upon their peers to embrace the working-class realignment that Trump grasped at an intuitive level, even as he failed in execution.

Between deindustrialization and the steady exodus of college-educated voters to the Democratic party, the Republican party’s shift toward the working class has been decades in the making. A similar trend can be seen elsewhere, too, from Boris Johnson’s blue-collar supporters, to the unabashedly pro-union platform of Erin O’Toole, the newly minted leader of the Conservative party of Canada.

The main difference in the US case has been the failure, if not outright resistance, of the Republican party’s political machinery to adapt in real time. Indeed, for all of Trump’s capacity for disruption, he was no match against the institutional edifice of the so-called “conservative movement” – the dozens of free-market thinktanks, law firms and leadership organizations that were called upon to staff his administration and define his agenda.

So while the notion of the Republican party becoming a multiethnic working-class coalition may seem farcical now, the longer-term trend speaks for itself. The only question is whether the party’s elite will continue to deny this reality, or take the next four years to rebuild and realign conservative institutions to better reflect the actual interests of their rank and file."
Donald Trump's malignant spell could soon be broken,['Jonathan Freedland'],"Barring a twist inconceivable even by the standards of 2020, we will soon know the result of the US presidential election – and it will almost certainly be a cause for rejoicing. Donald Trump, the man who has haunted the world’s dreams and sparked a thousand nightmares, has all but lost. On 20 January 2021, he will probably leave the White House – or be removed if necessary. The Trump presidency, a shameful chapter in the history of the republic, will soon be over.

True, it is taking longer than we might have liked. There was to be no swift moment of euphoria and elation, an unambiguous landslide announced on election night with a drumroll and fireworks display. Instead, thanks to a pandemic that meant two in three Democrats voted by slower-to-count mail-in ballots, it’s set to be a win in increments, a verdict delivered in slow motion. Nor was there the hoped-for “blue wave” that might have carried the Democrats to a majority in the US Senate (though there is, just, a way that could yet happen). As a result, it will be hard for Joe Biden to do what so urgently needs to be done, whether that’s tackling the climate crisis, racial injustice, economic inequality, America’s parlous infrastructure or its dysfunctional and vulnerable electoral machinery. And it is glumly true that even if Trump is banished from the Oval Office, Trumpism will live on in the United States.

And yet none of that should obscure the main event that has taken place this week. It’s a form of progressive masochism to search for the defeat contained in a victory. Because a victory is what this will be.

Recall the shock and disgust that millions – perhaps billions – have felt these past four years, as Trump sank to ever lower depths. When he was ripping children from their parents and keeping them in cages; when he was blithely exchanging “love letters” with the murderous thug that rules the slave state of North Korea; when he was coercing Ukraine to dig up dirt on Biden, or else lose the funds it needed to defend itself against Vladimir Putin, the high crime for which he was impeached; when he was denying the reality of the coronavirus, insisting it would just melt away, thereby leaving more than 235,000 Americans to their fate and their deaths – when he was doing all that, what did his opponents long for? The wish, sometimes uttered to the heavens, was not complicated: they wanted Trump’s defeat and ejection from power. Few attached the rider that it would only count if the Democrats could also pick up a Senate seat in North Carolina.

Nor does it seem as though any defeat for Trump will be tentative or partial, even if the delayed result might make it feel that way. Joe Biden crushed him in this contest. He beat him in the popular vote by a huge margin, four million at last count, with that figure only growing as the final result is tallied. Yes, in a high-turnout election, Trump got more votes than he did in 2016 – but Biden got more votes than any presidential candidate in history, more even than the once-in-a-generation phenomenon that was Barack Obama.

What’s more, Biden looks to have done something extremely difficult and vanishingly rare, taking on and defeating a first-term president. That would ensure that Donald Trump becomes only the third elected president since Herbert Hoover in 1932 to try and fail to win re-election. Trump would take his place alongside Jimmy Carter and George Bush the elder in the small club of rejected, one-term presidents. As it happens, both those men were gracious in defeat and admirable in retirement, but Trump won’t see them that way. He’ll regard them as stone-cold losers. And he’s about to be one of them, his place taken by a decent, empathic man with the first ever female vice-president at his side.

It’s worth bearing all that in mind when you hear the predictable complaints that Biden was too “centrist”, or that Bernie Sanders would have done better. It could be argued that Biden outperformed the rest of his party, pulling ahead even as Democrats lost seats in the House and failed to make great gains in the Senate. Note that Trump’s prime attack line – that “far left” Democrats were itching to impose “socialism” on America – cut through in this campaign, clearly alarming Cuban and Venezuelan voters in Florida, for example. But it was a hard label to stick on a lifelong pragmatist like Joe Biden: most Americans just didn’t buy it.

What it adds up to is not perhaps the across-the-board repudiation of Trump and the congressional Republicans who enabled him these past four years. But it does count as an emphatic rejection of what Trump did as a first-term president – and, if it holds, the prevention of all the horror he would have unleashed if he had won a second.

It means that a majority of Americans have said no to the constant stream of insults, abuse and lies – more than 22,000 since Trump took office, according to the Washington Post. They have said no to a man who was a misinformation super-spreader, who called journalists “enemies of the people” and denounced inconvenient truths as “fake news”. They have said no to a man who suggested people should guard against Covid by injecting themselves with disinfectant; who dismissed science in favour of Fox News; who dismissed the word of his own intelligence agencies, preferring conspiracy theories picked up on Twitter.

They have said no to a president who saw white supremacists and neo-Nazis march in Charlottesville in 2017, and declared that they included some “very fine people”. They have said no to a man who referred to one black congresswoman as “low IQ” and suggested four others, all US citizens, should “go back home”. They have said no to the man who refused to disavow the far-right groups who worship him, telling those racist extremists instead to “stand back and stand by”. They have said no to the man who trashed America’s allies, who withdrew the US from the Paris climate agreement, and who grovelled to every strongman and dictator on the planet.

The next few weeks will be perilous. Trump will not concede; he will continue to deny the legitimacy of this result. His performance on Thursday night was perhaps his lowest and darkest yet, groundlessly telling Americans they could have no faith in their most solemn democratic rite: the election of a president. As he leaves, he will scorch the earth and poison the soil.

But all of that is to remind us why it was so essential, for America and the world, that he be defeated. And why, even though it may have arrived slowly and without the fanfare so many of us wanted, this will be a moment to savour. A dark force is being expelled from the most powerful office in the world – and at long last, we can glimpse the light.

• Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"
Trump should have lost in a landslide. The fact that he didn’t speaks volumes,['Nathan Robinson'],"In the lead-up to the 2020 election, Democrats were extremely confident in Joe Biden’s prospects. With his comfortable lead in national polls, there was talk of a Biden landslide, a giant “blue wave” that could turn Texas blue. Even though the polls had been off in the 2016 election, media commentators reassured audiences that Biden’s lead was different – far stronger and more stable – than Hillary Clinton’s had been.

As of this writing, it does look as if Biden will squeak his way into the White House. But only just. And no “blue wave” materialized. Far from turning Texas blue, Biden appears to have severely underperformed relative to Hillary Clinton in some heavily Hispanic areas. Democrats have not retaken the US Senate and failed to knock out a single Republican in the House of Representatives. Millions more people voted for Trump than in 2016, and it became disturbingly clear that even if Trump himself is booted from office, “Trumpism” is alive and well.

There was no need for it to be this way. Donald Trump has badly mishandled the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans. The economy is in recession. The Republican war on the Affordable Care Act seems more heartless than ever as millions lose their insurance.

Trump did not run a good campaign. He botched the first debate. He squandered his campaign cash. His messaging against Joe Biden was unfocused and often incoherent, simultaneously trying to paint him as a radical Antifa-sympathizing socialist and a corrupt corporate establishment figure. At a time when the economy was voters’ No 1 issue, Trump was focused on the emails of Biden’s ne’er-do-well son, Hunter. A campaign that presented voters with a clear and compelling alternative should have easily defeated Trump.

But Biden didn’t offer a clear and compelling alternative. He was a weak candidate from the start, so much so that even some of his allies were worried what would happen if he won the primary. Biden, like Hillary Clinton before him, represented the corporate wing of the Democratic party; he loudly defended the private health insurance industry and the fracking industry from attacks by the left. He ran away from proposals favored by the Democratic base like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. He didn’t show much interest in courting core constituencies like Latino voters (reportedly, the Biden campaign did not consider them part of its “path to victory”, which helps explain the losses in Texas and Florida). Biden didn’t even put much energy into the campaign; at crucial moments when Trump’s team were knocking on a million doors a week, Biden’s was reportedly knocking on zero. His ground game in important swing states like Michigan was “invisible”.

To many on the left, then, Biden’s lackluster performance is no surprise. Yes, Trump could have been resoundingly defeated. But 2016 proved once and for all that the Democratic establishment simply doesn’t have a message that can effectively counter Trump. The party leadership ignored the lessons that should have been learned four years ago. Instead, Democratic strategy is the very definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.

We know how Democrats can win again. Thomas Frank, in his vital book, Listen, Liberal: Or, What Ever Happened to the Party of the People?, explains that Democrats need to get back to being a party that offers something meaningful to working people. We know that voting Republican is no indication that voters actually want the agenda the Republican party will pursue in office. Fox News polling indicates voters want universal healthcare, abortion rights and a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants. Florida voters, even as they selected Donald Trump, also opted to increase the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour. The Democrats do not need to propose insipid half-measures when the data indicates that the public are fully on board with a progressive agenda.

This is why many of us on the left were pushing so hard for Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary. We believed that he had a winning formula for combating Trumpism, that the conventional wisdom that centrism is “pragmatic” was totally upside down. Bernie knew how to speak to Trump’s own voters, he could go to a Fox town hall and have the attendees cheering for single-payer healthcare, or win over a crowd at Liberty University. We believed that in a general election, he would be able to move the kinds of discontented anti-establishment voters who put Trump in office, and would have dominated in the rust belt states where Biden is just barely squeaking by.

That theory is untested; we never got a chance to compare what a left candidate could do against Trump with what Clinton and Biden managed. But the disappointing Democratic performances in both 2016 and 2020 should tell us that something is deeply, troublingly wrong with the party. A reality TV clown who supports policies most Americans hate (eg tax cuts for the rich) should not be coming anywhere near winning a presidential election. Yet he is. Why?

Blaming the voters simply will not do. This is a failure of leadership. Those responsible for it need to be held accountable. Unfortunately, it looks like some in the party will learn the wrong lessons. Even though dozens of democratic socialists won their elections this year while centrists struggled, there is a contingent among Democrats whose solution to any problem is the same: become more like Republicans.

Already, there is talk that they need to embrace tax cuts and run away from the “socialism” label. In other words, double down on what they were already doing. Those who think that is the lesson may simply be “unteachable” – a word George Orwell used to describe the old British cavalry generals who still insisted on using horses long after the invention of automatic weapons, and could not be persuaded that a horse is not useful against a machine gun. Today’s Democratic leaders are like those generals. If 2016 couldn’t persuade them that they were wrong, this won’t either. Nothing ever will.

It is time for a whole new approach, not a double dose of the existing one. We need to take the right lessons from this election, the ones that didn’t take in 2016. First, don’t trust polls, and don’t get complacent or assume the tides of history will carry you to victory. Second, Trumpism will not “self-destruct”: you can’t simply run against Trump, you need a powerful alternative vision that actually gives people what they say they want and fights for something worth believing in."

Chief of staff Mark Meadows tests positive for Covid-19,['Gabrielle Canon'],"Donald Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, has tested positive for Covid-19, along with at least one other aide to the president.

Two senior administration officials confirmed the diagnosis to the Associated Press.

The news came just days after Meadows appeared with Trump at a White House event along with numerous people who were not wearing masks.

Worth noting that Mark Meadows was at the election night party at the White House Tuesday that hundreds of people attended. Officials said everyone would be tested beforehand. — Kaitlan Collins (@kaitlancollins) November 7, 2020

Neither Meadows nor the White House has commented or confirmed that he contracted the virus and little is known about when or if he has developed symptoms, but advisers told reporters on Friday night that he shared the news with others at the White House after Tuesday’s election.

The news came during a week that the US set daily records for confirmed cases during the pandemic, which has so far killed more than 236,000 Americans.

Despite warnings from top health officials, Meadows has been critical of wearing masks, and even refused to keep one while speaking to reporters in October. He was seen in the early hours of Wednesday morning again without a mask on, standing close to the president’s family, as Trump took the stage to illegitimately and prematurely declare himself the winner in an election it looks increasingly unlikely he can win.

Nick Trainer, a Trump campaign aide, also has tested positive for the virus according to Bloomberg and sources say at least three other aids also have the disease. This marks what could be the third outbreak of Covid to hit the White House and more than three dozen associates have already gotten the virus, including the president and the first lady.

The administration has sought to contain the news when officials fell ill, and Meadows is largely believed to be behind those efforts. When pressed by CNN’s Jake Tapper after several of vice-president Mike Pence’s staff tested positive last month, Meadows said “sharing personal information is nothing something that we should do”.

He also admitted that the Trump administration was no longer working to “control the pandemic” and was instead waiting for the development of a vaccine.

The new outbreak inside the White House comes as the US faces grim new records. On Thursday, roughly 122,000 new coronavirus cases were reported, the third consecutive day with more than 100,000. More than 9.7 million people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in the US so far this year.

On Saturday morning, Johns Hopkins University in Maryland put the total US coronavirus caseload at 9,731,198, with 235,925 deaths.

States recording record daily highs on Friday included Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and Utah.

News of Meadows’ test came days after he appeared with Donald Trump at a White House event at which numerous people did not wear masks. The president himself was previously treated for Covid-19, spending three days in hospital, after attending a White House event at which Covid mitigation measures were not enforced.

Members of Trump’s family, senior aides and leading Republicans have all contracted the virus after attending events in Washington and on the campaign trail. On Friday, Bloomberg News said numerous Trump campaign aides had also tested positive.

Last weekend, Dr Anthony Fauci, the senior US public health expert, posted a dire warning about the coming winter and the ongoing pandemic.

“We’re in for a whole lot of hurt,” Fauci told the Washington Post, angering the White House. “It’s not a good situation. All the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors. You could not possibly be positioned more poorly.”

On Friday, across the US, states posted record numbers.

In Illinois, faced with 20,000 new cases in two days, JB Pritzker, the governor, said a stay-at-home order was possible if the spread was not slowed – just before his office announced that he was self-isolating after being exposed to the virus for a third time.

With a record 10,374 new infections reported on Friday and 10,000 deaths passed this week, Pritzker was asked if he would order people to stay home, as was required by Illinois and many other states in the spring.

“We’re in a bad situation [but] I’m not looking at the broader mitigation of stay-at-home ... as in something I would do in the coming days or a week,” he said. “But I can’t guarantee you what it looks like two weeks from now or three weeks. I just don’t know.”

Kentucky reported 2,302 new cases and 10 more deaths on Friday. More than 1,000 people were hospitalised. Governor Andy Beshear urged 80 counties classified as “red zones” to follow state emergency recommendations. Last week, 68 counties were on the red-zone list.

“I know we’ve been in this fight for so long that it’s easy to get numb to the scary headlines and high case numbers,” Beshear said. “That’s normal. It’s human nature. But you have to understand this is the most dangerous Covid-19 has ever been in the commonwealth and it is leading to more of our fellow Kentuckians becoming sick, being hospitalised and dying.”

Kansas added a record 5,418 new cases over two days as hospitals warned of serious strain. The increases brought the state’s Covid case total to 97,633, up 5.9% from Wednesday. The state added 79 deaths to bring its total to 1,166. Deaths have more than doubled since mid-September.

Kansas’ health department head, Dr Lee Norman, said cases “are just skyrocketing” because people are spending more time indoors, attending public events and family gatherings without being diligent about masks or social distancing. He said he was worried cases will spike again from Thanksgiving get-togethers, while many officials “haven’t done anything” to check the surge.

In Texas, a district judge upheld an order from El Paso county’s top elected official shutting down businesses while the region fights an alarming surge in cases. The decision from Judge Bill Moody of El Paso’s 34th district court came as federal military medical teams deployed to the border region, at the request of the state.

El Paso county judge Ricardo Samaniego ordered a two-week shutdown of non-essential activities late last week. In making his decision, Moody pointed out that during the Spanish flu pandemic in the early 20th century, city and county officials had authority to respond as they “thought was necessary to protect the health and financial interests of their individual communities”.

Ken Paxton, Texas’ attorney general, has argued that Samaniego’s order is illegal because it goes against Governor Greg Abbott’s statewide order to reopen businesses. Chris Hilton, an attorney with the Texas attorney general’s office, said the state would appeal Moody’s order.

El Paso joins 10 other Texas cities, including Houston, San Antonio and multiple communities in the Rio Grande Valley, to receive aid from the Department of Defense at the request of state officials."
Aspirin to be tested in UK as potential coronavirus treatment,['Aaron Walawalkar'],"Recovery trial researchers look at whether drug can reduce risk of dangerous blood clots

Thousands of coronavirus patients in Britain will be given aspirin as part of a trial to determine whether the painkiller can reduce the risk of dangerous blood clots.

The cheap and widely available drug has been added to a list of potential treatments to be tested as part of the Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 therapy (Recovery) trial, one of the biggest in Britain.

People infected with coronavirus seem to have hyper-reactive platelets, the cell fragments that help stop bleeding, which means that they are at higher risk of potentially deadly blood clots, scientists say.

Experts hope that aspirin, an anti-platelet agent which is commonly used as a blood thinner, can reduce the possibility of clotting complications.

“Aspirin is widely used to prevent blood clots in many other conditions, including heart attack, stroke, and pre-eclampsia in pregnant women,” said Prof Martin Landray, co-chief investigator of the trial.

“But enrolling patients in a randomised trial such as Recovery is the only way to assess whether there are clear benefits for patients with Covid-19 and whether those benefits outweigh any potential side-effects such as the risk of bleeding.”

At least 2,000 patients are expected to get 150mg of aspirin daily along with the usual regimen. Data from those patients will be compared with at least 2,000 other patients who receive the standard Covid-19 treatment on its own.

Small daily doses of aspirin have been found to reduce the risk of certain cancers. As a blood thinner, it increases the risk of internal bleeding, and taking too much over a long period of time has been associated with kidney damage.

Other treatments being tested in the Recovery trial include antibody-rich plasma collected from recovered Covid-19 patients, and Regeneron’s antibody cocktail that was used to treat Donald Trump’s Covid-19 symptoms.

The decision to add aspirin to this list was made by the Oxford University researchers leading the trial and England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, following a recommendation by the UK Covid-19 Therapeutics Advisory Panel.

Unlike Gilead’s remdesivir, which has been approved as a Covid-19 treatment in the US but has shown poor results in a large World Health Organization trial, aspirin is a generic drug, making it much cheaper.

The Recovery trial was the first to show that dexamethasone, a steroid that is also cheap and widely available, could save lives of people severely ill with Covid-19. It also showed that the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, once touted by Trump as a cure, was of no benefit in treating Covid-19 patients."
Green groups denounce Brazil's 'sham' Amazon tour for foreign diplomats,['Dom Phillips'],"Environmentalists have criticised a three-day tour of the Amazon that the Brazilian government staged for foreign ambassadors as a “sham” and “media propaganda” after it failed to stop at any environmentally devastated areas.

The tour ended on Friday and focused on better-protected areas of the northern Amazon. “The government prepared an itinerary that does not show the reality of the Amazon – the abandonment of indigenous peoples, the land grabbing, the illegal mining and the uncontrolled deforestation. It is a sham,” said Marcio Astrini, executive director of the Climate Observatory, an umbrella group of environmental NGOs.

Brazil’s vice-president, Hamilton Mourão, who hosted the tour and heads the government’s Amazon council, said seeing the effects of Amazon deforestation and fires close up was “not necessary”.

Analysts said the tour was a sop to European governments wavering on ratifying a trade deal between the EU and the South American trade block Mercosur. Amazon deforestation and fires have accelerated since Jair Bolsonaro took office as Brazil’s president in January 2019 with an anti-environmental agenda, promising to develop the region.

“Governments in favour of ratification want Brazil to do things like that in order to help them to make a case … back in their capitals,” said Oliver Stuenkel, a professor of international relations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a São Paulo business school.

Others feared they had fallen into a propaganda trap as an official government Twitter account falsely tweeted that Brazil protected its environment more than anywhere else, and Bolsonaro’s claim that “shady interests” coveted Amazon riches. Many of the claims were debunked by the environmental factchecking site fakebook.eco.

First mooted by Bolsonaro a year ago and organised after eight European countries, including the UK, in September urged Brazil to take “real action” over deforestation, the trip concentrated on the Amazon city of Manaus and the rainforest’s better protected northern region.

It included a zoo, a deforestation monitoring centre, a sustainable farm and the confluence of the Amazon and Negro rivers near Manaus, a major tourist point. On Friday, ambassadors visited a military base in the Yanomami indigenous reserve and an indigenous health centre in the remote town of São Gabriel da Cachoeira.

Greenpeace delivered an alternative route to ambassadors taking part before the trip began, suggesting they visit devastated areas such as the Jamanxim forest in Pará state. “I hope the ambassadors clearly understand this is nothing more than media propaganda that does not represent reality,” said Cristiane Mazzetti, an Amazon campaigner for Greenpeace Brazil.

Before setting off, the UK’s acting ambassador in Brazil, Liz Davidson, tweeted that “it is a shame the trip does not include visits to areas more impacted by environmental degradation”. She told Brazil’s Valor Econômico daily that the UK wanted to see a long-term plan to combat illegal deforestation.

In a last minute deviation from the official route, the ambassadors were due to fly over the BR-163 highway in Pará – the region suggested by Greenpeace – which cuts through heavily deforested Amazon forest, the G1 site reported. There were no plans to land.

“We looked to fly over the BR-163 region … we weren’t able to because there was cloud cover in spite of flying low, but it is important to make clear that taking them in loco is not really necessary,” Mourão told reporters in Manaus, according to the city’s A Critica site. He heads an army operation to combat fires and deforestation widely derided as ineffective.

Bolsonaro’s government has dismantled environmental protections. Environmental officials have been sacked, banned from talking to the media and forbidden to burn and destroy tractors and other equipment used by illegal loggers and miners. Deforestation hit a 10-year high between August 2018 and July 2019, reaching 10,129 sq kms, and indications are that the next figures, due next month, will be even higher.

Fires in the Amazon also hit a 10-year high, rising 13% in the first nine months of 2020. Bolsonaro falsely claimed in a speech to the United Nations that the rainforest did not burn, blaming indigenous people and a “disinformation campaign anchored on shady interests” for negative media coverage. In April the environment minister, Ricardo Salles – who was also on this week’s trip – called for more deregulation while media was distracted by the Covid-19 pandemic.

On Friday the Climate Observatory said Brazil’s greenhouse gas emissions rose by 9.6% in 2019. It said 2.2bn tons of carbon dioxide was released, driven by Amazon deforestation and making it impossible for Brazil to meet its 2020 emissions target."
Trump backers tricked into joining ‘Gay Communists for Socialism’ on Facebook,['Kari Paul'],"Thousands of Donald Trump supporters have unwittingly found themselves in a Facebook group called “Gay Communists for Socialism”, after being tricked by its creators into joining what they thought was a pro-Trump election group.

On Thursday, a Facebook group called “Stop the Steal”, a reference to the president’s false claims that Joe Biden is “stealing” the US election, was disabled by the social network for misinformation after gaining more than 350,000 members. Other groups emerged in its place, including a second “Stop the Steal” group that attracted more than 40,000 castaways from the original group.

But less than 24 hours later, an administrator for the group changed its name to “Gay Communists for Socialism” without explanation, confounding the new members.

Dozens of posts from angry and confused Trump supporters asked, “What happened to stop the steal?” and, “Why is this group called gay communists for socialism?”, while others demanded, “Get me off this page!!!!!!”

The Guardian confirmed the group was created on 5 November as “Stop the Steal” before being renamed. One administrator, whose real identity could not be verified, told the Guardian the group was a planned operation to troll conservatives with a fake “Stop the Steal” group.

“We had no idea it would take off like this or suck in as many clueless people as it did when we made the switch,” the administrator said. He said the group, which now has 60,000 members, has an additional 20,000 member requests.

Another group administrator further trolled its members by telling them the name change had been done to keep Facebook from cracking down on it, and later said the group may have been hacked by Facebook itself. “We’ve been on the phone and messaging with Facebook trying to get to the bottom of this” – a clear joke, as Facebook does not have a public customer service phone number.

Many of the members still appear to believe the group name has been changed to avoid censorship by Facebook and that it remains true to the original conservative mission. “Still the same people, the same message, we just have to go into hiding because free speech isn’t a thing under Facebook,” one wrote.

The administrator told the Guardian it was likely the group would soon be removed due to the number of people in the group reporting content they are offended by. These reports, he said, are mostly coming from conservatives. “The real snowflakes,” he said.

Thieves have taken high-end goods worth hundreds of thousands of euros from the Paris home of a Saudi princess, a source close to the case has said.

The 47-year-old princess, who had not set foot in the apartment since August, discovered on returning that bags, watches, jewellery and furs worth some €600,000 (£540,000) were missing.

The princess, whose name was not revealed, was hospitalised in a state of shock and has not yet spoken to police.

The thieves appear to have entered the apartment, situated near the high-end Avenue George V in the heart of the French capital, without using force, the source said.

The bounty included around 30 Hermes bags worth between €10,000 and €30,000 each, a Cartier watch, jewellery and fur items.

Prosecutors have opened a formal investigation which will be handled by the Paris police’s special anti-gang unit.

Le Parisien newspaper reported that an early suspect was a man who had been staying at the princess’s apartment since August.

A spare set of keys to her home had gone missing, the paper added."
Ivory Coast opposition leader arrested after disputed election,[],"The Ivorian opposition leader and former prime minister Pascal Affi N’Guessan has been placed under arrest for creating a rival government after President Alassane Ouattara’s election victory, his wife and a spokeswoman have said.

Prosecutors in Ivory Coast are pursuing terrorism charges against more than a dozen opposition leaders who boycotted the 31 October vote in which Ouattara won a third term in office and announced they were creating a transitional council.

The standoff has raised fears of protracted instability in the world’s top cocoa producer, whose disputed 2010 presidential election led to a brief civil war. More than 40 people have died in clashes before and since the latest vote.

N’Guessan was arrested overnight after the public prosecutor confirmed on Friday that he was being sought by the police, his wife, Angeline Kili, told Reuters.

“I confirm that my husband was arrested during the night, but I don’t know where he is right now,” she said.

Geneviève Goëtzinger, a spokeswoman for N’Guessan, said on Twitter he was arrested in the south-eastern town of Akoupé while en route to his home town, Bongouanou.

The police were not immediately available for comment.

N’Guessan served as prime minister from 2000-2003 under President Laurent Gbagbo, whose refusal to concede defeat to Ouattara after the 2010 election led to a civil war that killed an estimated 3,000 people.

The opposition claims Ouattara has violated the constitution by seeking a third term. Ouattara says approval of a new constitution in 2016 restarted his mandate and allowed him to run again."
Palestinian prisoner agrees to end hunger strike after 100 days,[],"A Palestinian prisoner held by Israel has agreed to end more than 100 days of hunger strike, his family and a prisoner rights’ advocate have said, claiming he had received assurances from Israeli authorities that his open-ended detention would not be extended beyond the end of November.

Maher al-Akhras, 49, has refused to eat since he was arrested in July and locked up under administrative detention, a policy Israel uses to hold Palestinians without charges on suspicion of undisclosed security offenses. These renewable detention orders have come under heavy criticism from Palestinians and human rights groups, which allege the policy violates the right to due process.

Qadoura Fares, the head of advocacy group Palestinian Prisoners Club, said on Friday that under the agreement, Israel will not extend the current administrative detention order for al-Akhras when it expires on 26 November.

Al-Akhras’ family said he will spend the next 10 days at Kaplan hospital in central Israel, where he has been since 6 September, after which he would be transferred to an Arab hospital in east Jerusalem for another 10 days and then released from there.

“He has ended his strike and now he is undergoing a medical check-up to begin eating,” Al-Akhras’ wife, Taghreed, told Associated Press by phone.

“He weighed 104kg (229lbs) before and now he is 61kg (134 pounds), she added.

Israel’s Shin Bet security agency said al-Akhras’ detention order was already scheduled to end on 26 November. It would not elaborate. A security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said al-Akhras had rejected a similar court proposal last month to release him on that date as long as no new evidence was presented against him.

The Shin Bet has said al-Akhras was arrested based on information that he is active in the Islamic Jihad militant group and was involved in “activities that endanger public safety”. According to the agency, he was arrested five previous times for involvement in militant activities. The family denies such involvement.

The Islamic Jihad, which has killed scores of Israelis in suicide bombings and other attacks over the years, has threatened to respond with attacks on Israel if al-Akhras’ condition deteriorated further.

Israel holds 4,200 Palestinian prisoners, 300 of them under administrative detention, according to Fares of the advocacy group."
Sound of the city: monkeys shown to prefer traffic over jungle noise,[],"They may be naturally suited to swinging in rainforests, but monkeys in a Finnish zoo have demonstrated a “significant” preference for traffic sounds instead of the noises of the jungle, researchers have found.

As part of an experiment to see how technology could improve the wellbeing of captive animals, researchers installed a tunnel fitted with sensors in the enclosure of the monkeys at Helsinki’s Korkeasaari zoo, giving the primates the chance to choose to listen to the sounds of rain, traffic, zen sounds or dance music.

“We thought they would enjoy more calming sounds, such as zen music, but actually they triggered the traffic sounds more,” said Ilyena Hirskyj-Douglas, a researcher at Finland’s Aalto University.

The soundtrack of vehicles rumbling past proved overwhelmingly the most popular choice for the animals, who sometimes slept or groomed themselves and each other inside the sound tunnel – something they did not do for any of the other sounds, Hirskyj-Douglas said.

The zoo’s research coordinator, Kirsi Pynnonen, said she believed the road sounds mimicked some of the monkeys’ natural means of communication.

“In the wild, these monkeys use high-pitched hissing, squeaking and croaking to stay in contact,” she said – noises that the animals may hear within the traffic noises.

Sound experiments have been performed on animals in captivity before now, but the scientists say this was the first attempt to try and give the creatures full control over what they want to listen to.

In the future, it could enable zoos to provide animals with extra stimuli in their enclosures.

“Animals could, for instance, control their lighting, heat or the temperature,” or even play games, Hirskyj-Douglas said.

“The technology is very much open and we’re just starting to bridge into this area.”

Other zoos around Europe had shown interest in the research findings, Pynnonen said, and the team would look next at installing screens inside the tunnel for the monkeys to watch if they choose.

White-faced saki monkeys were mid-sized primates native to the northern countries of South America, where they were “relatively numerous” but threatened by the destruction of the rainforest, Pynnonen said.

“Despite what many people think, they don’t eat bananas at all, but seeds, insects and some fruits.”"
Storm Eta death toll rises to 100 after devastating mudslides,['Reuters In Guatemala City'],"Rescuers reach remote mountain village in Guatemala where people were buried in their homes

The death toll from the calamitous Storm Eta in Central America has soared after the Guatemalan military reached a remote mountainous village where torrential rains had triggered devastating mudslides, killing about 100 people and adding to dozens of other deaths in the region.

Many of the dead were buried in their homes in the remote village of Quejá in the central area of Alta Verapaz, where about 150 houses had been swallowed by mudslides, army spokesman Rubén Téllez said.

The Guatemalan president, Alejandro Giammattei, indicated the death toll could jump higher, with the number of dead and missing in Quejá estimated to total about 150.

The devastating weather front brought destruction from Panama to Honduras and Mexico, which between them registered more than 50 flood-related deaths

One of the fiercest storms to hit Central America in years, Eta on Friday dumped more torrential rain across large parts of Central America, and the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned “catastrophic flooding” in the region would continue.

Rescue operations across Honduras and Guatemala have been slowed by destroyed roads and bridges, forcing authorities to draft in the military and use helicopters and speedboats to rescue people stranded on top of their houses.

Photos of the Queja landslide showed a lengthy strip of brown mud peeled from the lush green hillside. A video shared by the army showed soldiers trying to get to Queja having to haul themselves through a morass of mud with the aid of a guide rope. Searches for Queja survivors continue.

Eta wrought chaos after ploughing into Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane on Tuesday with winds of 150 mph (241 kph), before weakening to a tropical depression and unleashing torrents of rain on regions of Honduras and Guatemala.

“This is the worst storm Honduras has seen in decades. The damage will undoubtedly be significant,” said Mark Connolly, UNICEF representative in Honduras, who estimated about 1.5 million children there will be affected by Eta.

Giammattei earlier added that bad weather was hampering rescue efforts, which were further limited by the country having only one helicopter for the job. “We have a lot of people trapped [whom] we have not been able to reach,” he said.

A further eight people were killed in Honduras, where Max González, the minister of the National Risk Management System (Sinager), said about 4,000 people had been rescued but many others remained trapped on their roofs.

“We have been without food for two days ... waiting to be evacuated,” said William Santos, sheltering on top of a banana packing plant with about 300 people in northern Honduras.

Across swathes of Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica, high winds and heavy rain have damaged hundreds, if not thousands, of homes, forcing people to take cover in shelters.

Two artisanal miners were killed in Nicaragua while in southern Costa Rica, officials said a landslide killed two people in a house: a Costa Rican woman and an American man.

Near the Costa Rican border in Panama’s Chiriquí province, five people – including three children – died in flooding, authorities said.

On Friday morning, the eye of the storm was on the edge of Belize’s coast and heading out to the Caribbean Sea, charting a course to Cuba and Florida this weekend, the NHC said.

It also said remnants of Eta will continue to batter portions of Central America with “catastrophic, life-threatening flash flooding and river flooding” and added that flash flooding and river overflows were also possible across Jamaica, south-east Mexico, the Cayman Islands and western Cuba."
Michigan couple with 14 sons finally has a daughter,[],"A Michigan couple famous for having 14 sons have welcomed their first daughter, nearly three decades after the birth of their first child.

Jay Schwandt said he and his wife, both 45, “are overjoyed and beyond excited to add Maggie Jayne to our family”.

“This year has been memorable in so many ways, for so many reasons, but Maggie is the greatest gift we could ever imagine,“ he told the Detroit Free Press following his daughter’s birth at Mercy Health Saint Mary’s hospital in Grand Rapids.

The Schwandts have been featured for years in local and national news. The couple have a live-streaming program called 14 Outdoorsmen that may now need a name change.

Their oldest child, Tyler Schwandt, 28, said his parents thought they would never have a daughter at their home in the rural community of Lakeview, about 30 miles north-east of Grand Rapids.

Wolves win in Colorado after vote for reintroduction by 2023,['Rasha Aridi'],"Sign up for monthly updates on America’s public lands

Coloradans have voted to reintroduce wolves, which were hunted and trapped to extinction in the 1940s, to the state by 2023.

The proposition squeaked by with 50.4% of the total votes as of Thursday night. This is the first time American voters have ever weighed in on reintroducing a wildlife species, as that decision is usually left up to a state’s team of wildlife biologists.

Gray wolves once roamed across two-thirds of the continental US. Without wolves at the top of the food chain, the whole ecosystem is out of balance, says Eric Washburn, a campaign manager at the Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund, the advocacy group behind the proposition.

Yellowstone national park reintroduced gray wolves to the park in 1995, and Washburn looks to it as a living laboratory and model for Colorado’s reintroduction plans. The return of the region’s apex predators set off a cascade of natural events that ultimately restored Yellowstone’s “ecological integrity”, says Washburn, and the reintroduction is hailed as one of the world’s greatest rewilding stories.

Wolves were first listed as endangered 45 years ago, when the population dropped to 1,000 individuals in the continental 48 states. Now it sits at about 6,000.

Colorado’s decision is complicated by the fact that just last week, the Trump administration delisted gray wolves from the US Endangered Species Act (ESA) after announcing the species’ “successful recovery”. Hundreds of biologists dispute this, in part because wolves still only occupy a sliver of their historic range.

States will now decide if wolves can be hunted or trapped. And since wildlife cannot recognize state lines, wolves can move in and out of states where they can be killed, thwarting conservation efforts. For example, the gray wolf is endangered in Colorado but only threatened in Wyoming, where wolves can be killed on sight in 85% of the state. Last year, at least three wolves from north-west Colorado were killed when they moved into Wyoming.

“We do worry about that, but there’s not a whole lot we can do about that because wolves will go where they see habitat,” said Washburn. “But the good news is, there’s 17m acres of public land habitat in western Colorado.”

Washburn also hopes that the decision to delist wolves from the Endangered Species Act will be overturned by a federal court."

Kylie Minogue: ‘It’s time to dress in sequins and glitter through the darkness’,[],"By the time you read this, two pivotal issues should soon be settled. There is the small matter of the US election. Then there is the fate of Kylie Minogue. If her newly released 15th album, Disco, beats Little Mix’s Confetti to No 1 next week, she will be the first female artist to top the UK album chart in five consecutive decades, a feat only previously achieved by Paul McCartney, John Lennon and Paul Weller. “I’m so glad I didn’t know that when I was making this album,” she says, her still thoroughly Australian accent expressing real relief. “I would have felt the pressure.”

It is a Friday afternoon in mid-October, and we are in a London photo studio, where Minogue has just finished an intensive two-hour, four-outfit shoot (this counts as elite-level efficiency, the Guardian’s photographer tells me). The only trace left is her pink glittery eyeshadow, a contrast to her Bruce Springsteen T-shirt and khaki trousers. The ankle-shattering silver stilettos have been replaced with cream plimsolls. Sitting at the other end of a velvet sofa, Minogue folds and unfolds a black face mask, aptly embroidered with “More Joy” (not bespoke, it turns out, but a designer Christopher Kane job).

This is what she calls the “pointy end” of an album release, the pressure of the final push made “a little bit extra” by the pandemic. Minogue was recording in Brighton when lockdown sent her home to London. She can hardly recall those early weeks, she says: “Trying to grasp the concept of what’s happening: no planes, no cars, so much cleaning.” She tended her plants and worried about her family in Covid-stricken Melbourne – she hadn’t seen them since December, when she went back to celebrate the 100th birthday of her Welsh grandmother, her only remaining grandparent. She watched Tiger King: “Everyone watched Tiger King.” Then, not wanting to lose the momentum she’d felt in the studio, she ordered more equipment and learned how to record herself in order to finish the album at home. She ended up relishing it, working into the night. “There’s no one looking at you, you haven’t travelled in, you’ve got your comforts around you,” she says. “I do a lot more takes. And the next thing you know it’s 1am, 1.30… this is ridiculous! Call it quits! Just do one more…”

It is pure coincidence that Disco arrives three days after the US election, though it feels more like cosmic synchronicity: when Kylie is on the dancefloor, you know all is well. She is a glittering constant of the past 33 years, a byword for pure pop joy – and Disco is uber-Kylie, a definitive return to the genre whose sparkly, against-the-odds spirit has always defined her. In one sense, it’s a determinedly nostalgic album, with echoes of Gloria Gaynor and Abba, the sounds of Minogue’s childhood. Hearing those artists now, she says, she is nine or 10 years old again: “I’m transported back to the family living room where the record player was, going through my parents’ records and putting Donna Summer on, and Abba and the Bee Gees.” But it is also a pointedly future-facing album: musically, it could go toe-to-toe with her fellow 2020 disco revivalists Dua Lipa or Jessie Ware; lyrically, it’s distinctly optimistic, all about taking us “where the music never ends”.

Disco, for Minogue, is synonymous with rebirth. In the late 90s, she made a foray into indie, but the moment every night on tour when she covered Dancing Queen reminded her of the joy of being a pop star and nudged her back to her roots. I remind her that, when she was signing a new record deal at the time, Parlophone told her they didn’t have anyone like her on their books; she replied that nobody did, because there was nobody like her. She’s embarrassed to hear this repeated: “Oh God, that sounds like a very confident statement!”

What did she mean by it? “If I had to sell myself with my ad in the paper to them, what would I have said?” she asks, aghast, trying to think herself back into that mindset. “I don’t know! Up for most things? Song and dance?” If that sounds like self-effacement, it also gets to the essence of Kylie: never encumbered by grandiose ideas, she exists in service to the perfect pop song. She got one, too, in 2000’s Spinning Around, a disco smash that announced itself like Bianca Jagger’s horse striding on to the Studio 54 dancefloor. A year later, she topped it with Can’t Get You Out Of My Head.

There is a freedom to Minogue’s new album that you don’t hear on its predecessor, 2018’s country-tinged Golden. Made soon after her very public breakup with the actor Joshua Sasse (they were engaged; Minogue had given him a slot on her Desert Island Discs, for which he read a cringeworthy erotic poem), it reflected on what she calls “a very relatable tail-between-the-legs moment”. She wanted, she says, to “ugh, get the emotions out”. The record’s lyrics dealt in finality and exhaustion. Career-wise, it felt like make or break: she had just turned 50, and was bored with being asked how that felt, “when I don’t know the answer”. She felt she had a mountain to climb. “When I was talking with the team, I’d say, ‘If it works,’ and I’d stop myself and say: ‘It has to work, it has to work, I can’t… ’”

What if it hadn’t? “I just would have found it really difficult.”

Would she have stopped making music? A long pause. “I may have felt like, well, that’s my time,” she says quietly. “I don’t know. Perhaps that’s my use-by date, or maybe I have just lost my way. And if you really are lost, it can be hard to find your way back.”

In the end, the album was a success: not only commercially (it hit No 1 in the UK) but, she says, “I totally found my way on a personal level, making Golden – it was a reclamation of self. Once I achieved that, I was able to move on and felt utterly liberated.”

For years, Minogue’s appeal has been understood as escapist. She also conveys a relatable sense of hope in adversity. Whether facing obstacles in pop or love – or health after surviving breast cancer in the mid-2000s – she has always “tried to meet most of those hurdles face on”, she says. “To feel the fear and do it anyway.”

The end of her relationship with Sasse left her feeling “once bitten, twice shy”, she says: “I didn’t can the idea of meeting a new companion or love, but I certainly wasn’t in a hurry.” But she wasn’t single for long; she has been with her boyfriend, GQ creative director Paul Solomons, for two years. To see her pick herself up, dust herself off and keep going feels hopeful.

Nick Cave was there at one of those earlier pivotal moments, as Minogue questioned her pop identity in the mid-90s: after he briefly lured her to the darkness for their gothic 1995 duet Where The Wild Roses Grow, he encouraged her to embrace the light. “There is no pretence in Kylie,” he tells me. “On some level we understand her ordeals, yet she radiates pure joy. This is an extraordinarily powerful message. Kylie is the real thing.”

Jake Shears, a friend since his Scissor Sisters heyday, thinks Minogue was born to make people feel good. “It’s the love that she’s received since she was a child,” he tells me. “Her parents are wonderful. I also have incredible parents: when you get so much love when you’re little, if you are going to lean towards this direction as a performer – if you are this exhibitionist, if you are a showgirl – I think that can really help.”

I wonder whether this expectation – that she will always be sunny and uplifting – has ever felt limiting to Minogue. “I probably wouldn’t have done a murder ballad with Nick Cave if that was the case!” she counters, reasonably enough. And, as she points out, hers is a career peppered with weird hairpin turns: collaborating with the Manic Street Preachers and Sam Taylor-Johnson (a 1996 short in which a topless Minogue mimes to an aria); acting in French director Leos Carax’s strange 2012 film Holy Motors (she played Eva, a mysterious, tragic torch singer). She loves scaring the horses. “I do spend a lot of time doing this,” she says, meaning the pop star stuff, gesturing towards the studio where the glittery curtains are being packed away. “There’s definitely enough to stimulate and challenge me and drive me crazy, to get to whatever that thing is we’re trying to get to. But I really enjoy the challenge of those other things, of stepping into someone else’s road.”

There are some roads Minogue does not want to go down. In her 40-year career, the only political stance she has taken is to support legalising gay marriage in Australia. Is now any different? Her new single, Say Something, could be heard as a rallying cry to stand up for your beliefs; to overcome the divisiveness of recent years (the track ends on a question: “Can we all be as one again?”). Plus, disco is survival music, rooted in black, queer communities that have been particularly under threat in the Trump era.

“Have we ever all been as one?” Minogue says, thinking. “I don’t know. We have our communities where we feel as one, our dreams where we’re as one. It would be lovely, of course. But at the same time we’re celebrating that, everyone’s unique and different. It’s this constant push and pull.” She won’t make a prediction on the US election, but hopes we can move on from division. “Otherwise, we might as well just tuck ourselves into bed and sleep for the rest of our lives. But there are all sorts of discussions happening, about all sorts of things, which is fantastic, and everyone wants to be heard.”

Which discussions does she mean? “I have noticed a difference just in what we’re presented with on TV in the last few months, and I’ve felt better about that, personally.” What has she noticed? “More diversity on TV, beauty ads. Maybe there’s a point where you’re like, we can see what you’re doing – but at least it’s happening.” (I think she means that, while it can seem opportunistic, it’s a start.) “I’m like everyone else – no one expects life to be an easy ride,” she says, her accent starting to take on a Dolly Parton-ish southern US twang. “But it’s a bit of a bumpy ride right now.”

Nobody ever seems to ask her about politics. Does she not want to talk about it, or do people underestimate her? “Probably a bit of both,” she says. “That is not my area of expertise, for sure.” I try a specific issue: as an LGBTQ icon, what’s her take on the UK’s toxic debate over trans rights and transgender women’s access to single-sex spaces? “If you’re a transgender woman, you should use the women’s facilities, surely,” she says, before elegantly changing the subject. “There are plenty of people in the world who wanna make some noise and be disruptive. All the brave people who do make the noise, I really admire them,” she says, mentioning Black Lives Matter and trans activists. “But you have to figure out who’s making noise for the right reasons.”

It’s becoming more apparent that one of my happy places is melancholy always just slightly outweighed by hope

A grandmaster at the art of deflection, Minogue is sweetly impervious to grilling and stealthy about getting back to her preferred talking points. (Ironically, she would make a great politician.) This isn’t for fear of alienating elements of her fanbase, she says, but a condition of being a Gemini, able to see both sides of every argument – a line she has been using in interviews since before I was born (to hear it in person feels like getting the full Kylie experience). “I think if you’ve got political leanings, you’re there, there or there,” she says, poking the sofa, as if this settles the matter. “I just want goodness.”

And to be fair, she holds up her end of the bargain – ladling out the goodness. In summer 2019, Minogue released a greatest hits collection (her fourth) and performed in Glastonbury’s legend slot, 14 years after breast cancer forced her to cancel a headline performance in 2005. The response was rapturous, 100,000 fans genuflecting before the Pyramid stage (not to mention a record audience of 3.2m watching at home).

But when Minogue watched the show back, she tells me, she cried in frustration. Why? She explains by bringing up Talking Pictures, “the BBC throwback [series] talking with directors and actors, a nice little half-hour and easy with a cup of tea”. She just saw one with Billy Wilder talking about Some Like It Hot. “The interviewer says, ‘Do you watch your things back?’” She does a spot-on Wilder accent: “‘No, no, I can’t watch them – I see that should have been a faster edit, or that should have been…’” She finds revisiting her performances similarly difficult: “The mirrors were moved at the wrong time. That was a duff note, oh no, you didn’t hear the guitar there,” she recalls. “Even if they had all happened [correctly], I would have found other things.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Magic, from the new album, Disco

She just about managed to sit through it when the BBC replayed it in lieu of Glastonbury taking place this year. “It will very often seem dull to me because I don’t feel the stage shaking, the noise in my ear, the struggle of the quick change. But it just takes a little time to remove yourself from that, and see yourself how – or closer to how – someone else might see it.”

She insists she isn’t a perfectionist: “I’m just trying to get it as good as possible. Perfect is pretty much unattainable, I think, and in hindsight can be the best and worst thing simultaneously.” She thinks perhaps the closest she came was Can’t Get You Out Of My Head. “The song, the visuals – but I wouldn’t describe it as perfect. I’d just say the planets are in a line, because it’s a bit beyond you. It’s greater than the sum of its parts.” She mentions her collaborators (Cathy Dennis wrote the song), but says there’s also some cosmic magic: “You’ve all done your best and happened to lock in really well, but I think it’s Other.”

She hopes Disco is Other, too. After the triumph of Glastonbury, she says, “I felt like it was time to play – to aim for stratospheric heights, even if only in my imagination.” Every artist claims that their latest album is their best in years, but in this case, I agree with Minogue. As well as the sparkling tunes, there is an existential streak that is in keeping with disco’s survivalist side. “Dressed in sequins and glittering through the darkness, creating that space of inclusion and expression” is how she describes it.

If its natural home is on dancefloors that are currently dimmed, that doesn’t matter. Disco was written to evoke “those little cosmic things that happen – all those lonely moments, knowing there’s someone else out there who understands your loneliness or stops your loneliness. The need for love, the longing for love.” Writing more of her own music has given Minogue a greater understanding of the balance she’s after. “It’s becoming more apparent that one of my happy places is melancholy always just slightly outweighed by hope,” she says.

The other melancholy, she says, is that of time passing. While she was making Disco, “there was also the matter of before 50 and after 50 [she is 52], so I wanted to get on with things”. Hence why the lyrics and artwork are filled with “stars shining bright, living a seemingly eternal existence”. She then ventures a fantastic, Stephen Hawking-level theory on pop’s immortality, how music reflects this tension between melancholy and hope. “A song begins and ends. There is harmony and unity and sometimes a clash in those few minutes. And they can live on long after we do.” Or on a lighter note, she says, “a listener can ignore the meaning of a song and just enjoy the beats or melody. Let that be the experience. Whistle it!”

It explains how Kylie has endured through those five decades, defying time by living for the moment. The real Minogue, however, is exhausted and ready to go home for a quiet Friday night with “Paulie”. First she signs a book for my cousin, a lifelong fan, and insists on taking my phone to record her a voice note. When the pandemic is over, she can’t wait to see her own family, “to hug them and feel normal”. Closer to home, she fancies a night on the tiles. “And to get absolutely merry, because I don’t normally,” she says. “Usually, I’m a couple of glasses of wine. But actually to go straight for a cocktail and stagger home – that sounds really good.” It’s a relatable, down-to-earth answer, and I don’t believe it for a second: as soon as she’s able, she’ll be back on stage, chasing a sixth decade of glittering up the dark.

'Nobody can block it': how the Telegram app fuels global protest,['Shaun Walker'],"One Sunday in August, two weeks after Belarus’s authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko declared an implausibly decisive victory in presidential elections, I joined a crowd of around 100,000 people as it moved through central Minsk. Protest in Belarus was no longer the domain of a few hundred hardy opposition figures, and the homemade placards many people carried illustrated how broad the coalition had become: “Let’s drink to love, from the bartenders of Belarus”; “Teachers against violence”; “Working class, go on strike!”

The previous fortnight had been a time of national awakening, as the country united around the goal of ending Lukashenko’s 26 years in charge. As grim footage of police violence circulated on the messenger app Telegram, large numbers came out to demand that their voices be heard.

The enormous crowd began to flow from Independence Square, through the broad central avenues of Minsk towards a second world war memorial – because many people had received messages on their phones telling them to head there. When we arrived, the monument had been surrounded by barbed wire and placed under armed guard. Some people shouted abuse; others offered the soldiers flowers and implored them to join the side of the people. After a tense, half-hour standoff, they looked down at their phones again. Mobile internet was not working for everyone (the authorities had been switching it off at key moments) but those tech-savvy enough to install the right virtual private network (VPN) apps were able to relay the news.

Each week, Nexta has announced the time and place of the protest a day or two before

The first place they looked was Nexta Live (pronounced “Nekhta” and meaning “someone” in Belarusian), a channel on Telegram. “Nexta says we should go towards the residence!” one man called out, joining a column of people making the short walk to Lukashenko’s official residence. Outside was a police line: cars, makeshift fences and a few hundred riot officers in balaclavas with shields. It was clear that attempting to push through would result in bloody clashes. Again, advice flashed up in the Nexta Telegram feed. “Minsk! Do not approach the police line! The best decision now is to disperse.” The crowd did just that. Since then, every Sunday, they have come out; each week, Nexta has announced the time and place of the protest a day or two before.

Telegram, a messaging app created by the reclusive Russian exile Pavel Durov, is suited to running protests for a number of reasons. It allows huge encrypted chat groups, making it easier to organise people, like a slicker version of WhatsApp. And its “channels” allow moderators to disseminate information quickly to large numbers of followers in a way that other messaging services do not; they combine the reach and immediacy of a Twitter feed, and the focus of an email newsletter. The combination of usability and privacy has made the app popular with protestors (it has been adopted by Extinction Rebellion) as well as people standing against authoritarian regimes (in Hong Kong and Iran, as well as Belarus); it is also used by terrorists and criminals. In the past five years, Telegram has grown at a remarkable speed, hitting 60 million users in 2015 and 400 million in April this year. Each day, another 1.5 million people sign up.

In Belarus, it permeates the political landscape. Opposition politicians issue press releases on a Telegram channel; journalists swap tips about where things are happening and how to avoid being detained; and people who have been tortured or beaten by Lukashenko’s thugs can find groups offering free medical or psychological support. Most importantly, Nexta Live and a number of smaller opposition channels feed subscribers with organisational information and rallying cries.

“How can you stop these Telegram channels? Can you block them? No. Nobody can,” Lukashenko complained. But if he can’t beat Telegram, he has decided to join it instead. On the Sunday I followed protesters through Minsk, Lukashenko took off from his residence in a helicopter and flew over us. Later, his press service posted video footage, shot from inside the helicopter, to his newly created Telegram channel: the leader, dressed in black and wielding an automatic rifle, surveyed the crowds below; “They’ve scarpered like rats,” he muttered, as he peered down from the windows. Lukashenko was meant to appear uncompromising and in control, but the video was quickly copied to opposition Telegram channels, overlaid with insulting captions, voiceovers and memes, and seen there by far more. At the time of writing, Lukashenko’s channel has 86,000 subscribers, while Nexta Live has almost 2 million, an impressive feat in a country of fewer than 10 million. Last month, Belarusian authorities declared Nexta’s channel and logo to be “extremist materials” in an unsuccessful attempt to scare followers off.

It is a common trope for embattled autocrats to claim that protesters are in fact puppets in the hands of nefarious foreign plotters. This summer, Lukashenko suggested that his opponents were backed by the massed armies of Nato, or shadowy forces in Washington DC. But the truth is rather more embarrassing: his nemesis is a 22-year-old blogger working from a room strewn with pizza boxes 300 miles away.

Two weeks after that Sunday in Minsk, I meet with Stepan Svetlov at Nexta’s makeshift headquarters, inside the office of an NGO in a Warsaw apartment block. After buzzing me in, Svetlov appears at the apartment door in baggy jeans and a blue sweatshirt. There are armed police outside; unsurprisingly, given the volume of threats the group receives. “We get them all the time. They say they’re going to blow the office up, they say they’re going to kidnap us and drive us back to Belarus,” Svetlov tells me. We sit down in the room from which he and four others run Nexta. It contains a couple of computers, and a table covered with blue takeaway coffee cups.

Svetlov, who only recently turned 22, has not been to Belarus for two years. His parents were there until recently, but have now left the country, having been advised by friends with government contacts that things might get dangerous. “At the start of all this, my mum was quite sceptical, but now she has started to support me,” Svetlov says. Has it been a shock for his parents that their son is now seen as the revolution’s puppet master? “You could say they were quite surprised,” he says, smiling.

Svetlov launched Nexta as a YouTube channel in 2015, shortly before the last round of elections in Belarus. “Nobody to vote for/ Only mustachioed portraits everywhere,” ran the lyrics to a song that formed the channel’s first post. Nexta’s sharply satirical videos about Belarusian politics swelled subscriber numbers to 100,000, and quickly brought it to the attention of the authorities. A clip Svetlov made entitled “Lukasherlock”, about the Belarusian president’s claims to have solved a crime overnight, was deemed to be in potential violation of a law on insulting the president, and a criminal case was opened against him. By that time, he was studying in Poland, and he has not returned to Belarus since. In 2018, Svetlov switched his main activities from YouTube to Telegram, realising its potential to reach more people more easily.

As the summer’s election campaign wore on, Nexta’s popularity began to grow, partly because other bloggers who remained inside Belarus were harassed or thrown in jail. Sergei Tikhanovsky, who ran a YouTube channel and intended to stand for president, was arrested in May. In June, Igor Losik, administrator of the second biggest Belarusian Telegram channel, was also arrested. Both remain in jail. Tikhanovsky’s wife, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, eventually ran against Lukashenko as an opposition unity candidate. The dictator assumed she would give the election a veneer of legitimacy while posing no threat; but her promise to be a transitional leader ahead of new, fair elections began to energise a population desperate for change. Svetlov and his small team in Warsaw were quick to share videos from her rallies.

On 9 August, election day, Belarusian authorities turned off the internet almost completely as they announced the results – 80% for Lukashenko and 10% for Tikhanovskaya – to widespread disbelief and fury. After three nights of protests and ruthless police violence in response, the internet returned, a sign the authorities felt they had the situation back under control. But as detainees were freed and began to tell their stories, the Nexta team in Warsaw was deluged with horrific testimony and graphic footage of violence and injuries. I spoke to a western diplomat who told me that it is hard to overestimate Svetlov’s role in this summer’s protests, with most traditional opposition leaders jailed or forced into exile before the presidential vote: “I think he’s been the most important person of this entire period.”

During the peak, there were about 200 messages coming every minute, or 100,000 a day. It was impossible to work through

Svetlov’s small team was overwhelmed by the volume of information coming from Belarus. “During the peak, there were about 200 messages coming every minute, or 100,000 a day. It was impossible to work through. We ignored text and just looked at photos and videos, and put the best on to the channel,” he recalls. As we speak, a young woman enters the office with a brusque, “Hi” and settles down for a shift at one of the computers, sifting through the thousands of messages, videos and tipoffs that Nexta receives each day. “You can’t talk to her, she’s still working anonymously,” Svetlov tells me, suggesting we continue our conversation in the kitchen.

I ask Svetlov about the Sunday I followed the crowds in Minsk, who in turn were following his directions. There were three people in the office that day, he says, tracking events in the Belarusian capital. There was no great science behind it: no complex software mapping the crowds, or algorithms to determine the numbers – simply three young people scrolling through hundreds of messages sent from the ground, and trying to determine which were the most relevant. Before major logistical information is put on the channel, it is debated in a small Telegram chat containing about 15 people, Svetlov tells me, including Nexta’s administrators and those from a few other channels.

“We understood that people were by the war monument, and they needed to do something. Someone suggested they should go to the residence and everyone agreed, so we put it on the feed,” he says. And with that, a 22-year-old sitting in Warsaw moved a crowd of 100,000 people in Minsk.

None of this would have happened without Telegram’s creator, Pavel Durov. The reclusive 36-year-old Russian is ascetic in most lifestyle choices, arrogant in his interactions with others and quite brilliant at what he does. Born in St Petersburg, he learned coding in school, and immediately used it to subvert authority. According to a biography by the Russian journalist Nikolai Kononov, Durov hacked the system so that all the computers in the classroom displayed a photograph of the teacher and the caption “Must die”.

Later, as a student at St Petersburg State University, Durov set up a web forum for his fellow students. He did everything he could to promote it, organising real-life beauty contests that forum users could vote on, and creating controversial alter egos to ramp up controversy. “They were really juicy characters and people believed in them: an anti-feminist, a homophobe, a Stalinist,” he told Kononov. In much the same way that Mark Zuckerberg’s Harvard forum grew into Facebook, Durov and his brother Nikolai, who still work together today, turned their university website into VKontakte (meaning “in touch”). The Durovs were joined by a team of young coders, working out of the famous Singer House building in central St Petersburg, and the company grew rapidly in Russia and the former Soviet countries, partly because it also allowed users to share music and videos.

As VKontakte evolved into a tech giant, Durov gained a reputation as a strange, imperious figure. Obsessed with The Matrix, he saw himself, like Keanu Reeves’ character Neo, as a coder with a mission. He looks a little like a boyish Reeves, and in his rare public appearances is always dressed in black. He is a fan of grand gestures, such as a 2012 stunt in which he threw 5,000 rouble notes (then worth about £100) from the windows of Singer House and watched people scuffle on the street below.

But many artists were unhappy at VKontakte’s failure to take action against widespread copyright infringements on the site, and it was also slow to act on offensive material or groups, including those belonging to “Occupy Paedophilia”, an organisation that shared videos of attacks on LGBT people to its 90,000 followers on the site. Durov has a libertarian streak and has often said over the years that he values free speech above all, though to many, his unwillingness to take quick action over hate groups looked like an evasion of moral responsibility.

He also refused to bow to Kremlin pressure to ban opposition political groups, after protests broke out in Russia in late 2011. “This is my official answer to the security services,” he wrote on Twitter at the time, posting a photograph of a dog wearing a hoodie. As the informal relationship he had with figures around the Kremlin broke down, he was forced to sell his stake in an investment fund linked to pro-Kremlin oligarchs; and in the aftermath of the annexation of Crimea in 2014, he fled Russia, citing threats against him.

Durov acquired St Kitts and Nevis citizenship, and is now based in Dubai, spending long periods travelling the globe with his team of 15 or so coders in tow, often staying in hotels or rented houses. His precise movements are hard to track, and he ignored several interview requests for this article. (An associate of his tells me this is because “he has very high quality standards” and has met few journalists who lived up to them.) Instead, Durov communicates through a sporadically updated Telegram channel, where around once a month he drops his thoughts on freedom of speech, or the flaws of rival messenger services, particularly WhatsApp, which he loves to denigrate (“WhatsApp sucks”). Occasionally, the channel gives an insight into Durov’s lifestyle, such as a post last June in which he extolled the virtues of a “seagan” diet of wild fish and nothing else. He drinks no alcohol or caffeine, and claims not to have taken any pills or medicine for the past 15 years. In an October post marking his 36th birthday, he shared tips on how to stay looking young (you should live alone, for a start).

Since leaving Russia, Durov has focused on Telegram, the app he began developing as a way to speak securely with his brother and other associates. He has portrayed Telegram as a labour of love; it carries no advertising, and he says he has so far funded it himself, from the vast profits he made from VKontakte. A plan to launch a cryptocurrency called TON, which would have been integrated into Telegram, faltered earlier this year after the US Securities and Exchange Commission ordered the cash to be returned to investors.

One of the chief reasons Telegram is so beloved of protest movements is that it will run even if national regulators ban it. Used in conjunction with another app called Psiphon, it can circumvent most firewalls. Protesters in Iran used this approach to get around a government ban on Telegram in early 2018. But this loophole makes it just as useful for drug dealers, terrorists and other criminals. In Britain and many other places, one of the primary uses of Telegram is for buying drugs. In India, authorities have found Telegram has become a leading source of pirated music and film streams. Most notoriously, it also became known as the Isis app of choice. Former former prime minister Theresa May singled out Telegram in 2018 when she warned about “smaller platforms” that “can quickly become home to criminals and terrorists”.

According to Joshua Fisher-Birch, a researcher at the Counter Extremism Project in New York, Telegram was the forum Isis fighters used most often to communicate with each other at the height of the group’s dominance of parts of Iraq and Syria. “They felt it was a safe space, because they would not have their data shared with any government, and they also liked the ease of use,” he tells me. Durov’s explanations for why he does not lose sleep over this have been far from convincing: “Ultimately, Isis will always find a way to communicate within themselves, and if any means of communication turns out to be not secure, they’ll just switch to another one,” he said at a conference in 2015.

But, despite its initial reluctance to work with governments, Telegram has started taking action against terrorist-linked channels, Fisher-Birch says. In November last year, thousands of chats, bots and channels with Isis links were removed, in a joint operation with Europol, who said Telegram had gone to “considerable effort” to identify and remove Isis-linked content.

Earlier this year I spoke, via Telegram audio, to the administrator of a number of channels covering the Hong Kong protests, including one with more than 100,000 subscribers. Anticipating what would happen in Belarus, he told me that the organisers used channels for disseminating timely information to protesters, and the group chats for discussing their next steps. He particularly appreciated a Telegram feature that allows one user to delete a chat for both themselves and the other party, and had used it when friends had been arrested, in case police gained access to their phones.

He also liked the way people could be mobilised very quickly. “A big Telegram moment was at the Polytechnic University [in Hong Kong] last November, when a lot of students were trapped inside and the police were trying to attack. We used the channels to get as many people there as possible to help save them from arrest,” he told me. Although he was sure that some of the chats were infiltrated by police informants, a feature allowing users to hide their telephone numbers meant he felt more protected than on WhatsApp or other messengers. “With Telegram, we are pretty sure that we can’t be monitored by the government,” he said.

Valentina, 72, started using Telegram, installed by her grandchildren. ‘It’s addictive: before I know it, it’s 3am'

In Belarus, it is not just the tech-savvy youth who rely on the app. I realised this at the end of a reporting day in the provinces, when I stopped the car in a small village about an hour from Minsk, and got chatting to a 72-year-old woman who lives alone in a neat cottage. A former manager at one of Belarus’s many Soviet-built, state-run factories, Valentina is exactly the kind of person one might have expected to support Lukashenko – and she told me that until a few years ago she had, appreciating the way he had steered the country through the 90s without allowing the oligarchy and inequality that developed in neighbouring Russia and Ukraine to take hold. “If he had left 10 years ago, he would have gone down as a hero, but he has started to treat the people as though they are trash,” she said as we drank tea made from leaves she had foraged herself.

The transformation in Valentina’s political views began when she stopped watching state news on television and started using Telegram, which one of her grandchildren had installed for her on the chunky desktop computer in her bedroom. Now, each night before bed, she draws the orange curtains in the spotlessly tidy room and settles into an armchair at her computer desk to scroll through her Telegram feed. “It’s very addictive! I think, I’ll just take a look for half an hour, and before I know it, it’s nearly three in the morning. Which is a disaster as I have to wake up early to tend the allotment.” Almost all her friends are on Telegram, too, usually with the help of their children or grandchildren.

Meanwhile, the standoff in Belarus appears to have reached something of a stalemate: the Sunday protests continue, but Lukashenko remains reluctant to make concessions. A whole network of smaller Telegram chats and channels, coordinating protest in various cities, streets or even specific apartment blocks, has now appeared, creating a localised and fragmented protest movement that authorities cannot possibly crush.

Back in Warsaw, I ask Svetlov what comes next for Nexta. The evening before we meet, the channel had published the home address of a pro-Lukashenko official. Wasn’t this an incitement to violence? “That was not meant to exert physical pressure on him – it was more for psychological effect, so that people start thinking about their actions. We see the same thing with policemen who are scared to show their faces and hide behind masks,” he says. In the weeks after our meeting, Nexta releases the names and dates of birth of thousands of policemen, having been sent a leaked list.

Will Svetlov feel a sense of responsibility if the protests turn violent, given the volume of his followers? What if something happens to the people he outs on Nexta? He shrugs, with his usual half-smile, and dodges the question. “From the beginning, we saw it as a peaceful protest. It was the authorities who started the repression.”

As Lukashenko’s legitimacy has crumbled, he has increasingly looked to Vladimir Putin for support. While the Russian president has little affection for Lukashenko, he has even less for street protest. In the Kremlin, there has been horror at how quickly discontent has flared in a neighbouring country that appeared to be stable. Russian authorities banned the app in 2018, after Durov refused to comply with their demand that Telegram should share encryption data with the security services on request. But after two years in which millions of Russians got round the ban by using their own VPN, this June the Kremlin gave up and legalised Telegram again.

Still, events in Belarus show that even in the harshest of crackdowns, neutralising Telegram as a mobilising force is close to impossible. Lukashenko recently warned Putin that he, too, should be wary of Telegram: “You’re a powerful country, a nuclear country. But the Soviet Union was also a nuclear country. So you can’t relax… Through the internet, through these Telegram channels, they will get so deep into people’s brains.” The words were clearly meant to pressure Putin into continuing to prop him up, but Lukashenko might have a point – that the app, created by an exiled Russian, could one day play a similar role in Russia.

Recently, Svetlov inserted a poll into the Nexta Live channel to ask followers where they were based. Out of more than 700,000 respondents, over half were in Belarus, but 28% were in Russia. “When things quieten down in Belarus, we need to start reaching that Russian audience, too,” Svetlov says, smiling. “We won’t call for people to protest. But if they start, we’ll certainly cover it.”"
"Caught in time’s current: Margaret Atwood on grief, poetry and the past four years",['Margaret Atwood'],"I can say with a measure of certainty – having consulted my poor excuse for a journal – that my poem “Dearly” was written in the third week of August 2017, on a back street of Stratford, Ontario, Canada, with either a pencil or a rollerball (I’d have to check that) on some piece of paper that may have been anything from an old envelope to a shopping list to a notebook page; I’d have to check that as well, but I’m guessing notebook. The language is early 21st-century Canadian English, which accounts for the phrase “less of a shit”, which would never have been used in, for instance, Tennyson’s “In Memoriam AHH”; though something like it might have appeared in one of Chaucer’s more vernacular tales – “lesse of a shitte”, perhaps. This poem was then taken out of a drawer, its handwriting more or less deciphered by me, and typed as a digital document in December 2017. I know that part from the date and time identifier on the document.

The poem was composed much as described at the beginning of it. I was indeed making my way along the sidewalk, rather slowly. My knees were in poor condition due to my having recently spent five hours in a twisted position in the back seat of a car with a one-and-a-half-year-old, with a bunch of luggage piled on top of me. (Improved now, thanks. Or the knees are.) I was in fact carrying half a cup of coffee in a takeout cup with a regrettable plastic lid. (Better options are available now, thanks to the justifiable uproar over plastic pollution.) Slow walking leads to rumination, which leads to poetry. Park benches are my friends, and it wasn’t raining. Scribbling ensued.

Why was I walking alone, and not with Graeme Gibson – with whom I’d walked many hundreds of miles, ever since 1971, in places as diverse as Scotland, Orkney, Cuba, Norfolk, the mid-north mixed forest Canada, southern France, the Canadian Arctic, and the Northwest Territories? Walking had been one of our chief joys – that and canoeing – until his knees started to go, earlier than mine. So he was at the bed and breakfast in Stratford which we had been going to for some years, and I had hobbled out for supplies, fuelling myself with caffeine along the way.

We were in Stratford on our annual visit to see a mix of Shakespeare, musicals, and surprises. Was I also giving a talk? Probably, since I’d just published Hag-Seed, my modern-novel riff on Shakespeare’s The Tempest, the year before – set, not coincidentally, at a festival that bears more than a passing resemblance to the Stratford, Ontario one. Watching Shakespeare, researching Shakespeare, writing about Shakespeare – it’s a short leap to the contemplation of obsolete words, words that are fading, the malleability of language, all language – “gay” used to mean “happy”, and it once referred to the demimonde – and from that to the slipstream of time itself. We’re caught in time’s current. It moves. It leaves things behind.

That’s the foreground. In the near distance, Graeme had received a diagnosis of dementia in 2012, so we were five years into it. “What’s the prognosis?” he’d asked at the time. “Either it will go slowly, or it will go quickly, or it will stay the same, or we don’t know,” said the doctor. In August of 2017 it was still moving slowly enough, but the clock was ticking. We knew the what, but we didn’t know the when. As it turned out, Graeme was to die in almost exactly two years – in September 2019, two days after the London launch of my novel, The Testaments, he had a massive haemorrhagic stroke, typical of vascular dementia – and bowed out at about the time and in about the way he’d wanted to. Quick, relatively painless, and while he was still himself.

We’d talked about this a lot. We tried not to spend too much time under a pall of gloom.

We managed to do a lot of the things we wanted to do, and squeezed out enough happiness from hour to hour. Graeme was pre-mourned: all the poems about him in the book Dearly were written before he actually died.

At the same time, we were dealing with the MGM-Hulu television series of The Handmaid’s Tale – it had launched in April 2017 – and that in itself had been a blockbusting phenomenon. Its multiple wins at the Emmys were still in the future, as was the launch of the excellent mini-series made of Alias Grace – but both of them were still on my mind. Both were also backlit by the lurid glow cast by the 2016 presidential election, which I’d experienced like those nightmare movies where you’re expecting a girl to jump out of a cake and instead it’s the Joker. Had Clinton won the election, The Handmaid’s Tale TV series would have been framed as a bullet dodged. As things were, the viewership was not only very high but very horrified. However, few expected at this point that the efforts to undermine the foundations of American democracy – an independent, functioning media, a judiciary separate from the executive branch, a respect for the constitution and a military that owes its loyalty to the country as embodied in the constitution, not to some king or junta or dictator – would go as far as they were to go by November 2020.

Alias Grace, based on a real double murder of the mid-19th century, was also about to chime eerily, not only with the pussy-grabber-in-chief but also with the #MeToo uprising. The mini-series launched in September, the Harvey Weinstein allegations surfaced in October. But none of that had happened yet as I was limping along the street, meditating on the fading word, “dearly”.

What else was I doing in August 2017? I’d started my novel, The Testaments, about a year before – before the election, but in the lead-up to it. Having said for more than 30 years that I wasn’t going to write a sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale, and having thought that, in the 1990s after the end of the cold war, the world was moving away from dictatorships, I’d watched things turn around again after 9/11. Successful coups are staged at times of chaos, fear and social discontent, and by August 2016, we were already seeing a lot of that, not only in the US but around the world. We already knew, back in 1985, that the world of Gilead came to an end – otherwise it would not have been the subject of an academic symposium some 200 or more years later – but we did not know how. In August, I was in the initial or “mud pie” phase of exploring the possibilities, but I was not to send a one-pager to my publishers until February of 2017.

You can’t work easily on a novel while watching two plays a day. You can, however, scribble poetry. And so I did.

Here, then, is “Dearly”: a poem that’s part of its own zeitgeist, while claiming not to be part of it. It’s not exactly a memento mori; more like a memento vita.

To quote Ursula Le Guin (whose obituary I would shortly write, though that, too, had not yet happened), “Only in dark the light. Only in dying life.”

Poems – like everything else – are created in a particular time. (Two thousand BC, AD800, the 14th century, 1858, the first world war, and so on.) They’re also written in a place (Mesopotamia, Britain, France, Japan, Russia); and beyond that, in a location where the writer happens to be (in a study, on a lawn, in bed, in a trench, in a cafe, on an airplane). They are often composed orally, then written down on a surface (clay, papyrus, vellum, paper, digital screen), with a writing implement of some kind (stylus, brush, quill pen, steel nib, pencil, rollerball, computer), and in a particular language (Ancient Egyptian, Old English, Catalan, Chinese, Spanish, Haida).

Beliefs about what a poem is supposed to be (praising the gods, extolling the charms of a beloved, celebrating warlike heroism, praising dukes and duchesses, tearing strips off the power elite, meditating on nature and its creatures and botany, calling on the commoners to rebel, hailing the Great Leap Forward, saying blunt things about your ex and/or the patriarchy) vary widely. How the poem is supposed to accomplish its task (in exalted language, with musical accompaniment, in rhyming couplets, in free verse, in sonnets, with tropes drawn from the word-hoard, with a judicious number of dialect, slang, and swear words, ex tempore at a slam event) are equally numerous and subject to fashion.

The intended audience may range from your fellow goddess priestesses, to the king and court of the moment, to your intellectual workers self-criticism group, to your fellow troubadours, to fashionable society, to your fellow beatniks, to your creative writing 101 class, to your online fans, to – as Emily Dickinson put it – your fellow nobodies. Who can get exiled, shot, or censored for saying what has also veered wildly from time to time and from place to place. In a dictatorship, uneasy lies the bard that bears the frown: the wrong words in the wrong place can get you into a heap of trouble.

So it is with every poem: poems are embedded in their time and place. They can’t renounce their roots. But, with luck, they may also transcend them. All that means, however, is that readers who come along later may appreciate them, though doubtless not in the exact way that was first intended. Hymns to the Great and Terrible Mesopotamian Goddess Inanna are fascinating – to me at least – but they don’t cause the marrow to melt in my bones as they might have done for an ancient listener: I don’t think Inanna may appear at any moment and level a few mountains, though I could always be wrong about that.

Despite the way the Romantics went on about timeless fame and writing for the ages, there’s no “forever” in such matters. Reputations and styles rise and fall, books get spurned and burned, then unearthed and recycled, and today’s singer for eternity is likely to end up as the day after tomorrow’s fire starter, just as the day after tomorrow’s fire starter may be snatched from the flames, extolled and embossed on a plinth. There’s a reason the Wheel of Fortune in the tarot pack is, in fact, a wheel. What goes round comes round, at least sometimes. It’s not called the Inevitable Straight Road Pathway to Fortune. There isn’t one.

That advance warning having been issued, I’ll quote the postman in the film Il Postino, who’s nicked Neruda’s poems and ascribed them to himself in order to serenade his love. “Poetry doesn’t belong to those who write it,” he says. “It belongs to those who need it.” Indeed, after the poem has passed out of the hands of the one who’s written it down, and after that person may have departed from time and space and be wafting around as atoms, who else can a poem belong to?

For whom does the bell toll? For you, dear reader. Who is the poem for? Also for you.

Dearly

It’s an old word, fading now.

Dearly did I wish.

Dearly did I long for.

I loved him dearly.

I make my way along the sidewalk

mindfully, because of my wrecked knees

about which I give less of a shit

than you may imagine

since there are other things, more important –

wait for it, you’ll see –

bearing half a coffee

in a paper cup with –

dearly do I regret it –

a plastic lid –

trying to remember what words once meant.

Dearly.

How was it used?

Dearly beloved.

Dearly beloved, we are gathered.

Dearly beloved, we are gathered here

in this forgotten photo album

I came across recently.

Fading now,

the sepias, the black and whites, the colour prints,

everyone so much younger.

The Polaroids.

What is a Polaroid? asks the newborn.

Newborn a decade ago.

How to explain?

You took the picture and then it came out the top.

The top of what?

It’s that baffled look I see a lot.

So hard to describe the smallest details of how –

all these dearly gathered together –

of how we used to live.

We wrapped up garbage

in newspaper tied with string.

What is newspaper?

You see what I mean.

String though, we still have string.

It links things together.

A string of pearls.

That’s what they would say.

How to keep track of the days?

Each one shining,

each one alone,

each one then gone.

I’ve kept some of them in a drawer on paper,

those days, fading now.

Beads can be used for counting.

As in rosaries.

But I don’t like stones around my neck.

Along this street there are many flowers,

fading now because it is August

and dusty, and heading into fall.

Soon the chrysanthemums will bloom,

flowers of the dead, in France.

Don’t think this is morbid.

It’s just reality.

So hard to describe the smallest details of flowers.

This is a stamen, nothing to do with men.

This is a pistil, nothing to do with guns.

It’s the smallest details that foil translators

and myself too, trying to describe.

See what I mean.

You can wander away. You can get lost.

Words can do that.

Dearly beloved, gathered here together

in this closed drawer,

fading now, I miss you.

I miss the missing, those who left earlier.

I miss even those who are still here.

I miss you all dearly.

Dearly do I sorrow for you.

Sorrow: that’s another word

you don’t hear much any more.

I sorrow dearly.

Freddy on Rufus

What were you hoping for?

Someone with a sense of humour to accompany me to weddings and other major life events.

First impressions?

Handsome man with crisis bleached hair.

What did you talk about?

Travels, family dynamics and other unspeakable things. His mum’s new life in Margate and my previous life as a puppeteer.

Any awkward moments?

I think he thought I was trying to snog him when I asked about his attitude to social distancing.

Good table manners?

The best – kept my glass full and pretended not to notice when I burped.

Best thing about Rufus?

He was really easy to talk to. He made everything feel normal right away and kept the conversation going.

Would you introduce him to your friends?

I’d probably get replaced.

Describe Rufus in three words

Sweet, fun, relaxed.

What do you think he made of you?

That I was an aged old queer.

Did you go on somewhere?

Due to Bojo’s curfew, this was not really an option. I did bring G&T tinnies in my bag, just in case, but the vibes were not there. I drank mine on the way home.

If it weren’t for social distancing, would you have kissed?

I would probably need a stepladder.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?

We’d probably have got on better had we met at a house party in non-pandemic times.

Would you meet again?

Maybe as friends.

Q&A Want to be in Blind date? Show Hide Blind date is Guardian Weekend magazine’s dating column: every week, two strangers are paired up for dinner and drinks, and then spill the beans to us, answering a set of questions. This runs, with a photograph we take of each dater before the date, in Guardian Weekend magazine (in the UK) and online at theguardian.com every Saturday. It’s been running since 2009 – you can read all about how we put it together here.



What questions will I be asked?

We ask about age, location, occupation, hobbies, interests and the type of person you are looking to meet. If you do not think these questions cover everything you would like to know, tell us what’s on your mind. Can I choose who I match with?

No, it’s a blind date! But we do ask you a bit about your interests, preferences, etc – the more you tell us, the better the match is likely to be. Can I pick the photograph?

No, but don't worry: we'll choose the nicest ones. What personal details will appear?

Your first name, job and age. How should I answer?

Honestly but respectfully. Be mindful of how it will read to your date, and that Blind date reaches a large audience, in print and online. Will I see the other person’s answers?

No. We may edit yours and theirs for a range of reasons, including length, and we may ask you for more details. Will you find me The One?

We’ll try! Marriage! Babies! Can I do it in my home town?

Only if it’s in the UK. Many of our applicants live in London, but we would love to hear from people living elsewhere. How to apply

Rufus on Freddy

What were you hoping for?

A laugh, fun company, lovely grub.

First impressions?

Oh, I am a lot taller than him.

What did you talk about?

The brief amount of stuff we knew about each other prior to the date. The classic coronavirus filler chat, politics, our favourite flicks.

Any awkward moments?

I commented on his restless leg, which I felt a bit bad about because he tried to stop it but couldn’t.

Good table manners?

Yes, very. He showed an interest in what the waiters had to tell us and kept our glasses topped up.

Best thing about Freddy?

He was easy to talk to and had an interesting background.

Would you introduce him to your friends?

If he’s happy to get with them (Spice Girls, 1996).

Describe Freddy in three words?

Friendly, articulate, engaging.

What do you think he made of you?

Hopefully that I was quite pleasant and chilled, maybe that I can put away a lot of scran… God knows.

I know how I'll get through this winter: oversized jumpers and triple jacket potatoes,['Hadley Freeman'],"For exciting tax purposes, I’ve been going through old bank statements, because I really know how to carpe diem. It’s been quite amusing (in a relative, tax-based way) to see my patterns of spending. I don’t want to call myself a creature of habit, but you wouldn’t have to be Mystic Meg to predict my weekly trips to the bookshop (followed by lunch at the Greek restaurant around the corner – halloumi skewers and a glass of prosecco, because, as we already established, I know how to live). There’s the annual holiday to Spain; the regular purchasing of patterned dresses, because you can never have too many; the late-night cab rides home, soundtracked by Magic FM; the ludicrous parties I throw every year for Christmas and my birthday, because while the candles on the cake say 42, when it comes to parties I’m actually eight. This is what I think of as the stuff of life, or at least the stuff of my life, and it is very much the stuff of my bank statements from 2000 to 2019.

And now we look at the statements of 2020, which seem to belong to an entirely different person. Instead of the patterned dresses, my occasional big fashion buy is a pair of new pyjamas, to be worn all day, every day. The late-night cabs are now a Sunday morning taxi to take my children to wave to their grandparents, because they can no longer come over for visits, and we can’t take public transport to see them. One expenditure I don’t miss is the weekly trip to the toy shop for birthday presents for my children’s friends. Instead, some of this money has been funnelled into a subscription to Disney+, the mega mouse’s streaming channel, bought five minutes after lockdown was announced (Mother of the Year Award to the usual address, please).

I’d always thought of myself as someone with an unchanging inner core. Some people switch their accent approximately five minutes after landing in a new country, sloughing off old habits with the ease I change out of patterned dresses. But I still speak with the accent of the country I left before my batmitzvah; not having my regular habits leaves me feeling unmoored. Yet it turns out I can survive a year without throwing parties. Not happily, no. But it is possible.

I am no athlete (shocker), but my professional sport is throwing money at the problem (also dying on extremely small hills, usually in arguments about celebrities). While I can’t spend money in my usual ways, I still pump it into our dying economy, which feels like a patriotic duty and also a proactive grasp at living instead of succumbing to inertia. So here is my deeply aspirational guide to surviving winter 2020: what makes life better, what doesn’t and what is possibly proof of Covid brain fog.

Knitwear Forget those Trinny and Susannah-era fitted V-necks. The time to go big is now, ladies – I recommend men’s jumpers for extra heft. In my mind’s eye, I look like Alexa Chung; in reality, I look as if I’m wearing a blanket. In my heart, I don’t care.

Any romcom starring Julia Roberts, Drew Barrymore, Sandra Bullock This shouldn’t work, because these women made some seriously weird films. Never Been Kissed is about a teacher fancying a student, While You Were Sleeping is about a stalker, and I do not have the inner marrow to talk about Pretty Woman any more. But maybe it’s because they demand you turn off your critical judgment that they’re so soothing. Also, there is something very comforting about movies set in the 90s, all those bad jeans and giant mobile phones, in a time when the big news story of the day was Liam saying something mean about Damon. So engage in self-care and watch Runaway Bride.

Books Only nice ones, such as Andrew Sean Greer’s Less, Kiley Reid’s Such A Fun Age, Rae Earl’s My Mad Fat Teenage Diary. It’s fine to catch up on classics, but again, only nice ones by writers such as Barbara Pym and Dodie Smith. Unless you love anxiety-induced insomnia, now is not the time to finally read Philip Roth’s The Plot Against America (she says, from bitter experience).

Food Unlike everyone else who briefly got very excited about baking bread, I do not find cooking therapeutic. I like to put something in the oven, forget about it for two hours, and then eat it and feel nicely full afterwards. That’s right, I’m talking about the jacket potato. At the start of lockdown, I was eating a potato a day, and then my friend, colleague and fellow potato expert, Sali Hughes, suggested mixing a teaspoon of Marmite into one’s cheesy jacket potato, and the daily intake doubled (well, tripled).

In a parallel universe, I’d be booking in the Christmas parties now. Lord knows others have lost more this year, but it still feels poignant that I don’t need a single sparkly dress. Which is why it’s so important to make the weeks ahead less grinding. (And honestly, spending another night in watching Miss Congeniality in your pyjamas isn’t entirely bad.) We will make this winter better, people, one or two (or three), potatoes at a time."
"‘We need hope, not platitudes’: what I’ve learned as the parent of an ill child",['Mina Holland'],"A chorus announces the arrival of birthday cake in the corridor of paediatric A&E in Lewisham hospital, London. Were it not for the paper curtain separating the corridor from our cubicle, we’d be at the party, but there’s a different kind of bustle where we are.

Two registrars, a junior doctor and a nurse are trying to draw blood from my baby for the second time today, and, after more attempts than I can count, have so far been unsuccessful. Her face contorts, she squawks, her little limbs flail. This needle has burst the bubble of new parenthood irreversibly. “I’ve never seen a baby with haemoglobin this low,” the doctor tells me, grimacing.

This is just the beginning: a week (and then many more days) in hospital; a journey in navigating tiny veins; a version of motherhood I hadn’t foreseen; a frenzied, cutting fear; fielding other people’s feelings about our situation; and a distancing from the world I inhabited before.

By the time we arrived at A&E in May 2019, we thought we were well into the story – not at its beginning. Our daughter had been born by an only mildly dramatic emergency caesarean in that same building 11 weeks and five days earlier. She arrived small but perfectly elfin, with a mop of dark-brown hair, curious grey-green eyes and an acorn nose – our own woodland creature. We called her Vida.

Had I not so often been complimented on Vida’s porcelain skin, perhaps I’d have listened more to the niggle of doubt

What followed was a list of problems typical of life with a newborn: fussy feeding, gruesome witching hours, low mood on my part. If the health visitor and GP appointments hadn’t gone routinely, and had I not so often been complimented on Vida’s porcelain skin, perhaps I’d have noticed her pallor, or listened more to the niggle of doubt that all wasn’t well. But everyone said that having a tiny baby was hard.

So we kept going and tried to integrate aspects of life before a baby with life as parents: dog walks, food shopping; an afternoon in the pub. Vida wailed through much of this, but it did feel as if things were improving. Looking back, I realise it was simply that our skins were thickening, as was the plot.

Our arrival at A&E was the result of an appointment following up on an (apparently common) heart murmur. The paediatrician took one look at Vida and said she’d need a blood transfusion that day. We stayed in all week and, while my NCT WhatsApp group pinged with links to nursing bras and baby washes, Vida was drip-fed tiny amounts of blood to bring her haemoglobin (the protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen around the body) up to a healthier level. Things got better overnight; so much so that I realised what I’d been missing. Suddenly my baby latched on happily, breastfeeding for long spells, cheeks flushed like peaches.

But it didn’t last. We were discharged under instruction to bring Vida back for twice-weekly blood tests: each one revealed declining levels of haemoglobin. So started a summer-long process of trying to diagnose her condition. We left south London and took refuge at my mother-in-law’s house on the other side of town; we were transferred from our local hospital to a children’s hospital and then to another specialist; I deleted Instagram with its idealised take on mothering; and, while other new mums basked in flat whites and maraca-shaking, I Googled furiously. By the time Vida was diagnosed, seven weeks in, I could have been described as an enthusiastic amateur in haematology – but without the enthusiasm.

Vida was diagnosed with Diamond Blackfan anaemia (DBA). It’s a genetic bone marrow failure syndrome, usually detected in early infancy and characterised by an inability to produce sufficient red blood cells. There’s also a predisposition to certain cancers and the possibility of various other abnormalities. Treatment pathways vary, and could involve a lifelong course of steroids; or three-weekly blood transfusions alongside daily chelation treatment, to address the dangerous buildup of iron; or, in some cases, a bone marrow transplant.

All these treatments have implications. Steroids can affect growth and the adrenal system; regular transfusions tether you to hospital; transplanting bone marrow is a risky procedure that involves high doses of chemotherapy. Whatever our course, Vida will need medical supervision throughout her life. DBA is a genetic disorder, a spontaneous mutation; neither my husband nor I are carriers and, as yet, there is no definitive cure.

Since July last year, our challenge has been to reconcile Vida’s diagnosis with an otherwise healthy, happy little girl. As long as she is regularly transfused, ours is a normal life with a 20-month-old: she loves cheese, clapping, and our long-suffering dog; she is finding her voice (it’s a loud one); and we are experiencing the usual litany of teething, interrupted nights, and a moth-like attraction to screens.

Children have died from DBA’s complications. Some have had profoundly limited lives, but many live normal and fulfilling ones. Still, for the parent of a newly diagnosed child, the fear drowns out the hope. One of my regrets is that we lost control of our story while we awaited diagnosis. I wish we’d had a vague party line for family and friends: just “It’s a blood disorder”. But, in response to love and concern, word spread that Vida might have DBA, so, like me, people researched, read the outdated articles that had already sent me into panic, and drew their own conclusions about her “grave” prognosis.

People have tried to be kind, but in the early months it was hard to manage their feelings as well as our own. What do you say to someone for whom the unimaginable has happened, though? I wouldn’t have known, either. “I can’t even imagine”, “I’m so sorry”: these platitudes exist for a reason – there is truth in them, if not real empathy – but it is alienating to be told that we have to adjust to “the new normal”, or that Vida’s condition “is all she will ever know”. We need hope, but not trite reminders of our difference. Vida’s condition is written into every cell in her body, as inextricable from her as her loud voice. We have to celebrate what she is, not what she isn’t. “Full of life, but not haemoglobin,” as my husband puts it.

My own challenge has been to transform my terror, and my conviction that we are in some way cursed, into feelings of good fortune that Vida is otherwise well, and that we are lucky to have her at all. Over time, I have learned to accept the arbitrary nature of things: mutations happen. One in 25 children is born with a genetic disorder. Perhaps the greatest lesson has been that conversations about illness should be less taboo, and not shrouded in platitudes.

The best thing to say to the parent of an ill child is simply to ask how they are. The question “How is Vida?” acknowledges that, while you may be aware of her condition, she is also just a little girl who, like so many others, likes singing, bananas and being in charge. Importantly, this open question also passes us a blank sheet of paper on which to tell our own story. It makes me think of the Joan Didion line, “We tell ourselves stories in order to live”. As Vida’s parents, I like to think our version is what matters most – for her and for us – and it has been moving when people have been propelled into action, either by giving blood or, before Covid-19 struck, joining us in hospital for a transfusion day – Vida surrounded by her best allies.

One friend, a writer and a mother, left our house with the right idea. “I came away having played with the most scrumptious, smiling and strong-legged girl,” she said, after encouraging me to write all this down. “It may be such a good way to frame things, untangle the mangle of thoughts, which for mothers get twisted into terrible things...” So, here I am, writing, framing, untangling and owning our story, following that strong-legged girl who loves to be in charge. Onwards."

The passion on US TV news is great viewing. But be careful what you wish for,['Jane Martinson'],"Where were you when a US president stood up and claimed his own country’s election was corrupt – and media organisations simply cut him off because he had no evidence for any of his mad, rambling allegations? After so many years of Donald Trump spreading misinformation and manipulating the media, it felt like a historic turning point and a huge relief.

MSNBC halted its livestream, with host Brian Williams saying Trump’s Thursday night speech was “not rooted in reality and … dangerous”; USA Today did the same and removed the video from its platforms saying, “Our job is to spread the truth – not unfounded conspiracies.” CNN, which stayed with the White House speech until the end, called it “sad, pathetic and dangerous”. Its anchor Anderson Cooper then described Trump as “an obese turtle on his back flailing in the hot sun realising his time is over” – a line that lit up my social media timeline and WhatsApp groups as “the TV moment of the election”.

Even the pro-Trump media outlets owned by Rupert Murdoch seem to have changed their tune. After calling Arizona early for Biden, Fox News’s politics editor then said of Trump’s legal threats: “Lawsuits, schmawsuits – we haven’t seen any evidence yet that there’s anything wrong.” The Murdoch-owned New York Post headlined Trump’s latest speech with “Downcast Trump makes baseless election fraud claims in White House address”.

After more than four years in which the media on both sides of the Atlantic has struggled to deal with leaders who spread misinformation while claiming that the media is biased, the reactions to Trump’s speech felt like an industry finally able to assert its right to hold the powerful to account and properly question their claims.

Yet, while there is no question that Trump’s comments and indeed behaviour over much of the four years should have been called out long ago, there are still huge questions over journalists’ relationships to neutrality and balance – and how time-stretched journalists can get this wrong.

While many cheered CNN on Thursday, the BBC appeared to opt for a more balanced take, with an online headline that at first read “Trump repeats fraud claims and insists he has won” without any disclaimer. This was soon changed to “Trump repeats voting fraud claims without evidence”.

Headline changes are common in online media, and the BBC may understandably say that it was a brief mistake written by a late-night web team, but it nonetheless adds grist to the mill of those who believe that the impartiality British broadcasters are mandated to follow leads to a sense of balance that is objectively misleading. “If Trump says the moon is made of blue cheese, of course it doesn’t mean the BBC has to find someone who says it isn’t,” said one exasperated former BBC executive.

By Friday morning, the BBC had posted an impressive fact-checked rebuttal to Trump’s speech, which underlined its once revered motto that it’s better to be right than first. This motto worked well in the past for reporters on the ground in places such as Bosnia, or Los Angeles during the riots, but in the age of social media it has long been the case that lies can spread halfway around the world before truth is out of bed.

BBC presenters who dare to express opinions – Emily Maitlis on Dominic Cummings, for example – are slapped down as executives fret about the impartiality of an organisation that believes it must be representative of all licence fee payers.

But true impartiality allows reporters to say that politicians are lying if there are facts and evidence to prove it. Such calls are essential not just for democracy but the future of journalism, even if a combination of financial, political and technological pressure has made them harder. CNN has been a standout performer this election not because of its presenters, brilliant though they are, but because of a “magic wall” which provides detailed granularity of a complicated vote.

While US broadcasters are being celebrated, though, it seems wise to consider what the consequence of an increasingly opinionated journalism could be. Surely the endgame is Trump TV, the old rumour given a new lease of life by a probable – at time of writing – Biden victory. For Trump, said to be confused and upset by the loss of his biggest cheerleader in Murdoch, his own channel would be the perfect answer. In the UK, we have GB News and the proposed new Murdoch TV channel to look forward to.

Newly licensed ventures have seen how LBC has challenged the UK’s public service television impartiality requirements by showing political balance across the whole day rather than one opinion or show at a time. This is akin to the US model where for every CNN for those who have hated Trump for years, there is a Fox News host slavishly promoting his every view.

Given this, it would be wise if all those in the UK pumped by the passion and enthusiasm they can see on US TV reports and exasperated by an overly cautious BBC are careful what they wish for. Populist media, like populist politics, can be a dangerous game.

"When Donald Trump is peddling outrageous lies, where is the line between reporting and enabling? | Katharine Murphy",['Katharine Murphy'],"We’ve all been transfixed by the American election, glued to CNN or our preferred network or live blog of choice, constantly refreshing our social media feeds, cursing Nate Silver – demonstrating that global anxiety is the glue of 2020.

At the time of filing, the vote count is grinding on, and my purpose is not to get into winners and losers and the consequences. Here, I want to step back and look at some propositions that are uncomfortable for a person in my position to look at.

Full disclosure. There are questions I ask myself constantly as a long-term political reporter. Some of these questions are easy. The daily one: am I telling the truth? The semi-regular one: do I have Stockholm syndrome? The hardest one: am I part of an apparatus that is making things worse?

It’s the last question I want to focus on this weekend, the existential one, because the moment renders this question paramount. Donald Trump has accelerated the drift towards post-truth, and the media is shackled to that acceleration.

The post-truth festival reached a desperate zenith on Friday when Trump entered the White House press briefing room, and began lying copiously. The purpose of the lies, apart from graceless pique, was incitement. Trump wanted to rile his supporters. He wanted hackles raised. If Joe Biden wins, Trump wants to bequeath his political opponent a poison pill: a polity where resentments are so acute the country becomes ungovernable.

Faced with this reality – a lying, dangerous demagogue openly hostile to political conventions and democratic norms – media outlets face difficult choices.

As Trump threatens democratic systems, the US needs allies like Australia to speak up | Kim Hoggard Read more

Do networks refuse to broadcast the lies? Do media outlets disrupt the tirades with live fact-checking? Broadcast the news (and a president speaking meets the news test) without interruption, but put straps at the bottom of the screen alerting viewers to the fact a politician is making false claims? Broadcast minus the filter, leaving viewers to form their own conclusions?

Puncturing self-serving propaganda with facts is the primary duty of journalists who take their professional responsibilities seriously and Trump’s egregious falsehoods have triggered a rolling debate in my profession about the gossamer thin line between reporting and enabling. Call this rolling seminar atonement for the media’s role in facilitating Trump’s rise by treating the insurgent as a laugh track rather than the danger to democracy he actually was.

But the problem with the seminar is there are no easy or even right answers to the questions we’ve been asking ourselves. Consider Friday’s Trump tirade as a case in point.

Trump was trying to make a case that there is a conspiracy against him. Fake votes. Fake polls. Fake news outlets pretending the fake votes aren’t fake. Obviously this is a florid fantasy, but Trump is speaking to supporters, American citizens, who also hold these views. He’s validating voter predispositions, not inventing them.

Biden looks likely to win this contest, but not by a landslide. Millions of Americans have stuck loyally with Trump, turning out in record numbers in 2020, in large part because they feel alienated from the institutions Trump constantly attacks.

Decisions about live fact-checking or censoring Trump’s corrosive monologues carry higher stakes.

If we agree verifiable facts are important, that is a fact we can’t overlook.

So with that important context in mind, decisions about live fact-checking or censoring Trump’s corrosive monologues carry higher stakes. The decision becomes about more than what is true and what is false. Broadcasters also have to consider how that most fundamental expression of our professionalism sits with people who suspect the media is conspiring actively to tear down the brave politician who, in their eyes, speaks truth.

Journalists believe that speaking truth to power sits at the foundation of what we do. That’s our value add. But in a time where polarisation is so pervasive, we also need to consider whether our longstanding professional objective feels persuasive to people who believe everything is broken, and the media – the personification of winner-takes-all smug elites – is one of the principal reasons why it’s broken.

The simplest way to express the perilous crossroads my profession stands at is this: truth is all we have, but truth is not enough.

Having been honest about that, about the power of truth and its limits, we can now delve a little deeper.

Part of the reason why our once shared societal realities feel fractured – why truth feels increasingly informed by where you stand as well as what you see – is because the mass media has stepped away from helping to shape those shared realities.

Curating the commons was one of our roles during the golden age of journalism, but that “voice of God” era was already waning precipitously by the time I arrived as a reporter 20 years ago.

The reasons for this are complex. It would be a stupendously twee bit of reductionism for me to say the change has been driven entirely by commercial factors – that would miss the cultural revolution triggered by technological change – but the economics of our industry are part of the picture.

We can step the commercial drivers out simply. The internet ate our revenue. Since that happened, media outlets have had to chase paying audiences. Emotions drive engagement and subscriber/supporter loyalty, and opinion is cheaper than news gathering.

These underlying conditions incentivise media outlets to be sources of confirmation bias rather than pluralistic places where the resting views and dispositions of audiences will be challenged. The inexorable economics of the business is pushing media outlets to become preachers rather than persuaders, and this is part of the reason why democratic societies – America being the most critical case in point – are becoming ungovernable.

Bear in mind too that contemporary media outlets are also under constant pressure to shrug off their alleged golden age/gatekeeper arrogance and listen more to their increasingly self-selecting audiences – cries that become louder when journalists present to the world as self-important, or brittle in the face of criticism.

Preaching replacing fact-based persuasion is highly problematic for free societies, because there is no progress without persuasion, and there is no progress without active listening followed by compromise.

Now this isn’t me saying “woe is me”, or “media outlets do unhelpful things because *reasons* and we can’t help it” – it is about laying out the contributing factors to why things are as they are.

My profession did not wake up one day, hold a secret meeting, and determine our contribution henceforth would be to amplify and abet the cultural and technological forces herding people into tribes.

Truth is there’s been a significant disruption to the way we do business, and we have had to respond to it. This isn’t a plea bargain, this is a statutory declaration from a person living through a revolution in my own profession.

Joe Hockey and George Christensen back unfounded 'fraud' claims about Biden comeback Read more

Tracking back to the central question I wanted to focus on this weekend: am I part of an apparatus making things worse, when you assemble all the parts of the puzzle, the only honest answer to the question can be yes.

Some days I wonder whether I can keep doing the job at all, given that knowledge. The insight induces profound anxiety, at least for me.

But I know these things as well.

Truth may not be enough, but it is all we have. History tells us that truth sometimes loses the battle with lies – that monsters, despots, and fiends sometimes prevail. But cycles also turn, particularly when good people maintain hope and strive to perform modest acts of good in the world.

I know journalism at its best bears witness, and brings people verified facts.

I know that honest, diligent reporting is an act of public service, an expression of modesty rather than hubris.

I know reporting can change lives, it can speak for the powerless. Adequately resourced outlets can also stand and challenge the powerful when that job needs doing – which is most days in my experience.

I have no idea whether the values that exemplify my professional life prevail over the grand sweep of history.

But I know the core mission matters enough to persist."
Is the show finally over for Donald Trump? | Judith Butler,['Judith Butler'],"There was never any question that Donald Trump would fail to make a gracious and swift exit. The only question for many of us was just how destructive he would become in the course of his downfall. I know “downfall” is usually reserved for kings and tyrants, but we are operating in that theatre, except here the king is at once the clown, and the man in power is also a child given over to tantrum with no discernible adults in the room.

Don't underestimate the threat to American democracy at this moment | Corey Brettschneider Read more

We know that Trump will try to do anything to stay in power, to avoid that ultimate catastrophe in life – becoming “a loser”. He has shown that he is willing to manipulate and destroy the electoral system if he has to. What is less clear is whether he can do what he threatens to do, or whether the “threat” is left hanging in the air as an impotent command. As a posture, the threat to stop or nullify the vote is a kind of spectacle, composed for his base’s consumption. Considered as a legal strategy, however, by a team of lawyers, even lawyers working for the government, it constitutes a serious danger to democracy. As so many times before in the Trump presidency, we are left to wonder whether he is bluffing, scheming, acting (putting on a show) or acting (doing real damage). It is one thing to posture as the kind of guy who would do untold damage to democracy to hang on to power; it is quite another to make that show into reality, initiating the lawsuits that would dismantle the electoral norms and laws that guarantee voting rights, striking at the very framework of US democracy.

When we went to the polls, we were not voting for Joe Biden/Kamala Harris (centrists who disavowed the most progressive health and financial plans of both Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren) as much as we were voting for the possibility of voting at all, voting for the present and future institution of electoral democracy. Those of us outside of carceral institutions lived with a sense of enduring electoral laws as part of a constitutional framework that gave coordinates to our sense of politics. Many of those who had not suffered disenfranchisement before were not even aware of how their lives rested on a basic trust in the legal framework. But the idea of law as something that secures our rights and guides our action has been transformed into a field of litigation. There is no legal norm that cannot be litigated under Trump. A law is not there to be honored or followed, but as a potential site of litigation. Litigation becomes the ultimate field of law’s power, and all other kinds of law, even constitutional rights, are now reduced to negotiable items within that field.

Although some fault Trump for bringing a business model to governing, setting no limits on what can be negotiated for his profit, it is important to see that many of his business deals culminate in legal proceedings (as of 2016, he has been engaged in more than 3,500 lawsuits). He goes to court to compel the conclusion he wants. When the basic laws supporting electoral politics are litigated, if every legal protection is proclaimed as fraudulent, as an instrument profiting those who oppose him, then no law is left to constrain the power of litigation to destroy democratic norms. When he calls for an end to counting votes (much like his call to end Covid testing), he seeks to keep a reality from materializing and to maintain control over what is perceived as true or false. The only reason the pandemic is bad in the US, he argues, is that there is testing which furnishes numerical results. If there were no way to know how bad it is, then apparently it would not be bad.

In the early hours of 3 November, Trump called for an end to counting ballots in key states where he feared losing. If counting continues, Biden may well win. To circumvent that outcome, he wants to stop the count, even if citizens are deprived of their right to have their vote count. In the US, counting has always taken a while: that is the accepted norm. So what’s the rush? If Trump were sure to win if the electoral count stops now, we could understand why he wants to stop it. But given that he does not have the electoral numbers, why would he stop it? If the lawsuit that stops the count is accompanied by a lawsuit that alleges fraud (without any known basis for doing so), then he can produce a distrust in the system, one that, if deep enough, will ultimately throw the decision to the courts, the courts he has packed, the ones that he imagines will put him in power. The courts, along with the vice-president, would then form a plutocratic power that would enact the destruction of electoral politics as we know it. The problem, however, is that those powers, even if they generally support him, will not necessarily destroy the constitution from loyalty.

Some of us are shocked that he is willing to go this far, but this has been his mode of operating from the outset of his political career. We are still frightened to have seen the fragility of the laws that ground and orient us as a democracy. But what has always been distinctive of the Trump regime is that the executive power of the government has consistently attacked the laws of the country at the same that he claims to represent law and order. The only way that contradiction makes sense is if law and order are exclusively embodied by him. A peculiarly contemporary form of media-driven narcissism thus morphs into a lethal form of tyranny. The one who represents the legal regime assumes that he is the law, the one who makes and breaks the law as he pleases, and as a result he becomes a powerful criminal in the name of the law.

There is a general logic of destruction that kicks in when the downfall of the tyrant seems nearly certain

Fascism and tyranny take many forms, as scholars have clarified, and I tend to disagree with those who claim that national socialism remains the model by which all other fascist forms should be identified. And though Trump is not Hitler, and electoral politics is not precisely military war (not yet civil war, at any rate), there is a general logic of destruction that kicks in when the downfall of the tyrant seems nearly certain. In March 1945, when both the allied forces and the Red Army had vanquished every Nazi defensive stronghold, Hitler resolved to destroy the nation itself, ordering a destruction of transportation and communication systems, industrial sites, and public utilities. If he was going down, so too was the nation. Hitler’s missive was called “Destructive Measures on Reich Territory” but it was remembered as the “Nero Decree”, invoking the Roman emperor who killed family and friends, punishing those perceived as disloyal, in his ruthless desire to hold onto power and punish those perceived as disloyal. As his supporters starts to flee, Nero took his own life. His allegedly last words: “what an artist dies in me!”

Trump has been neither a Hitler nor a Nero, but he has been a very bad artist who has been rewarded by his supporters for his wretched performances. His appeal to nearly half of the country has depended upon cultivating a practice that licenses an exhilarated form of sadism freed from any shackles of moral shame or ethical obligation. This practice has not fully accomplished its perverse liberation. Not only has more than half of the country responded with revulsion or rejection, but the shameless spectacle has all along depended on a lurid picture of the left: moralistic, punitive and judgmental, repressive and ready to deprive the general populace of every ordinary pleasure and freedom. In that way, shame occupied a permanent and necessary place in the Trumpian scenario insofar as it was externalized and lodged in the left: the left seek to shame you for your guns, your racism, your sexual assault, your xenophobia! The excited fantasy of his supporters was that, with Trump, shame could be overcome, and there would be a “freedom” from the left and its punitive restrictions on speech and conduct, a permission finally to destroy environmental regulations, international accords, spew racist bile and openly affirm persistent forms of misogyny. As Trump campaigned to crowds excited by racist violence, he also promised them protection from the threat of a communist regime (Biden?) that would redistribute their income, take away their meat, and eventually install a “monstrous” and radical Black woman as president (Harris?).

The waning president, however, declares that he has won, but everyone knows he has not, at least not yet. Even Fox does not accept his claim, and even Pence says every vote is to be counted. The tyrant spiraling down calls for an end to testing, to counting, to science and even to electoral law, to all those inconvenient methods of verifying what is and is not true in order to spin his truth one more time. If he has to lose, he will try to take democracy down with him.

But when the president declares himself the winner and there is general laughter and even his friends call him a cab, then he is finally alone with his hallucinations of himself as a powerful destroyer. He can litigate as much as he wants, but if the lawyers scatter, and the courts, weary, no longer listen, he will find himself ruling only the island called Trump as a mere show of reality. We may finally have the chance to let Trump become a passing spectacle of a president who, in seeking to destroy the laws that support democracy, became its greatest threat, opening the way for some rest from what has seemed an interminable exhaustion. Bring it on, Sleepy Joe!"
The Guardian view on the election endgame: end Trump’s war on the truth | Editorial,[],"Since he took office Donald Trump has posed a grave threat to democracy. His wild, relentless post-poll fight against reality this week has shown just how dangerous he can be. Designed to give his supporters a rationale for their anger over losing the popular vote, the falsehoods raised troubling questions about when, and how, Mr Trump will leave the White House.

The bad news is that it won’t be anytime soon. Democracy in America is rare in giving a president more than 10 weeks of power after losing an election. Mr Trump is using this time to ratchet up the rhetoric to a fever pitch, seeding the idea that society is irreconcilably at odds with itself. This is profoundly damaging to America, a fact that cable networks have thankfully and belatedly woken up to after election day. Around the world former democracies are slipping into autocracy. The United States is not immune.

The fact is Mr Trump will lose the popular vote by millions of votes and only America’s outdated electoral college has saved him from a crushing defeat. The president should be preparing to leave the White House, not be instructing his lawyers. Perhaps Mr Trump cannot afford to lose. Presidential immunity from prosecution vanishes once Mr Trump leaves office, a consideration that may weigh heavily given the ongoing investigations by the New York district attorney into reported“protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization”. Mr Trump denies any wrongdoing.

For months it has been obvious that Mr Trump would claim victory and fraud should he lose the election. He has refused to say he would accept a peaceful transfer of power. The polls, he claimed, could not be trusted. Without a shred of shame, Mr Trump appears willing to challenge the validity of the vote in any state he loses, seeking to undermine the electoral process and ultimately invalidate it.

This is a dangerous moment. There’s no evidence of widespread illegal votes in any state. Yet a fully fledged constitutional crisis over the process of counting ballots is on the cards because Mr Trump is demanding recounts and court cases while conditioning his base to view the election in existential terms. Last year, in an influential and prescient analysis, Ohio University’s Edward B Foley wargamed how a quarrel over mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania could lead to a disputed result in the 2020 presidential election.

The most frightening scenario, said Prof Foley, was “where the dispute remains unresolved on January 20, 2021, the date for the inauguration of the new presidential term, and the military is uncertain as to who is entitled to receive the nuclear codes as commander-in-chief”. This ends with the US attorney general, William Barr, announcing that it is legally sound for Mr Trump to be recognised as re-elected for a second term while Democrats call for nationwide protests to dislodge the squatters in the White House. It would be better to avoid such a predicament rather than plan to get into it.

Republicans must not be seduced by Mr Trump into manipulating the electoral system, through political and legal battles, to defy the popular will for partisan advantage. The Grand Old Party has profited from voter suppression and gerrymandering to keep an emerging Democratic majority at bay. But these darker impulses have given rise to Mr Trump and an unhealthy reliance on a shrinking coalition of overwhelmingly white Christian voters paranoid about losing power.

Joe Biden looks to have done enough to win the White House. He will have his work cut out when he gets there, needing to rebuild the US government’s credibility after Trumpism hollowed out its institutions. That means offering hope to a country that faces a pandemic and an economic recession. He will have to reassert America’s role as the global problem-solver. Under Mr Trump the “indispensable nation” disappeared when it was needed the most. By any reasonable standard Mr Biden should not have to continue to run against Mr Trump. He must be allowed to get on with running America."
The left urgently needs to lose its inferiority complex,['Andy Beckett'],"This week Joe Biden – few people’s idea of an outstanding candidate – won the biggest presidential vote in United States history. Seven times in the last eight such contests, the Democrats have got more votes than the Republicans.

You could see this latest popular-vote victory as further confirmation of a theory that’s been promoted by some political scientists and journalists for a quarter of a century, most notably in The Emerging Democratic Majority, a 2002 book by John B Judis and Ruy Teixeira. The theory says that American social trends, which are making much of the country more diverse, urban and better educated – all characteristics associated with voting Democrat – are slowly but inexorably shifting the US away from the Republicans.

This might sound like liberal wishful thinking, but it’s a view that has also been held by senior Republicans. In 2012, Senator Lindsey Graham warned his party: “We’re not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.” Combined with the horror that many Americans feel at Donald Trump and how disastrously he has governed, this long-term leftward drift was widely expected this week to become an irresistible electoral force.

Instead, it met a series of seemingly immovable objects. First, Trump’s infamous aversion to ever being “a loser”. Second, his immense and again underrated appeal to conservative voters. Third, his party’s reluctance, which has intensified dramatically since the early 1990s, to accept any Democratic president as legitimate. Fourth, the Republicans’ willingness to use gerrymandering and voter suppression to tilt elections in their favour. And finally, the US’s rickety old election system itself: the electoral college and the system for choosing the Senate, with their seemingly ever stronger pro-Republican biases.

The result was deadlock – a weirdly frenzied deadlock in keeping with the mania of Trump’s presidency. Even if Biden eventually wins with some comfort, as looks increasingly possible, the result in the electoral college will probably be close, late and contested enough to be misrepresented as “a fraud” by Trump and millions of other rightwing Americans for decades to come. And the Republicans will probably have enough senators to seriously obstruct any Biden presidency.

Once more, the great Democratic breakthrough seems to have been postponed. Particularly left-leaning and anxious Biden supporters may be tempted to quote the melancholy Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci: “The old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.”

Watching from Britain, it is possible to see the past few days as a uniquely American saga. If you can temporarily forget about the implications for the entire planet, you can even follow it as a sort of political box set, an addictive multi-level drama to binge on as our national lockdown and our greyer politics grind on.

But to exoticise this crisis is a mistake. Versions of the American battle, between left-leaning parties backed by rising social groups such as the young on the one side and entrenched rightwing governments backed by older voters on the other, are under way in other countries. They will decide what sort of societies many western democracies become: how they distribute their assets and liabilities between the generations; how they respond to long-term threats such as the climate emergency.

In Britain, the 2017 and 2019 elections and the Brexit referendum exposed and left unresolved many of the same divisions as the current US election. And the Conservatives have become almost as aggressive as the Republicans in their efforts to prolong their dominance, launching culture wars, suspending parliament and gaming the electoral system, for example, by making it harder to register to vote.

Like the US, Britain has an admired old constitution (though ours is unwritten) that has proved easier for a shameless government to work around than many political traditionalists expected. And, as in the US, Britain’s two main parties currently have similar levels of support. Whenever our next general election comes, the third hung parliament since 2010 is a distinct possibility. Britons shaking their heads at the US’s election chaos probably shouldn’t gloat.

What can the left do about these deadlocks? One obvious but difficult solution is to reform the electoral systems that are biased against them – or at least make many more voters uncomfortable with how unfair these systems are. Another solution is to have more charismatic leaders, more effective election campaigns and more popular policies than the right. That’s a tall order, but stubborn rightwing ascendancies have been broken in Britain and the US before: by Labour in 1945, 1964 and 1997; by the Democrats in 1960, 1992 and 2008.

The enemies of conservatism also need to shed their inferiority complex. After Trump was elected, many liberals and leftists argued that he would be impossible to beat in 2020, as an incumbent with supposedly so much dark charisma. When Trump took an early lead this week, the same pessimistic mindset spread an expectation that Biden would be defeated, despite the well-known fact that many Democratic votes would be counted last. And once Biden went ahead, the pessimists started predicting that any presidency of his would be doomed before it began, and that Trump could even win next time.

Some of this pessimism may turn out to be justified. But it also suits the right’s political narrative: that they are the US and the west’s natural rulers, and that any periods of government by anyone else are temporary aberrations.

Twenty years ago, the Republicans captured the presidency in even more contentious circumstances, through the supreme court. George W Bush went on to govern as if he had decisively won. He was re-elected. The Democrats, and liberals and leftists everywhere, could learn from that.

'Tis the season to be wary: Christmas will be very different this year | Johanna Leggatt,['Johanna Leggatt'],"How are your Christmas plans coming along? Ordered the ham? Decided on the drinks list? Have you designed the perfect menu that caters to the gourmands in your lot, without alienating the fussy nephew who eats only carbs and Doritos?

Me neither. After close to seven months of some version of lockdown in Melbourne — seven bloody long months — the will and the energy to throw a huge party, to be part of one, has fled me. I am proud beyond measure of what Victorians have achieved but, like many, I am also changed: I’m wan, wary of premature celebration, fearful of relapse.

I am also steeling myself. This will not be a normal Christmas, as this has not been a normal year. And this fact pains me deeply, as I have always loved the reliable dagginess of Christmas; the hokey, homespun cheer; the ungainly embarrassment of carols by candlelight; the terrible jokes in the Christmas bonbons.

The UK can learn from Victoria how to bring its Covid second wave under control | Hassan Vally Read more

I love the offence given and taken among in-laws, the in-jokes shared by siblings, the telling glances that reference old hurts and transgressions scorched into family lore 30 years ago AND NEVER FORGOTTEN.

I love the 4pm Christmas Day slump when we all pass out, run ragged by revelry, presided over by a half-finished banquet of prawns and meats and clotting gravies, our Tudor-like bacchanal abandoned to the heat.

Parents exhausted. Kids crashing after sugar highs. Grandparents yelling at empty rooms to turn the music down, music that speaks of snow and chestnuts and reindeer, while we lie inert under the whoop-whoop of ceiling fans, stuffed on seafood, calling out for fresh ice.

It’s OK, we tell ourselves. It will be me, you and the dog, my partner says

But this year, Christmas will look and feel different for most of us. It is likely that some of our state borders will be eased — and stay that way — but nevertheless, not all of us will be able to gather together. We’re optimistic that we will connect with most of our loved ones, but again: we’re hesitant. Melburnians’ hearts have been broken before, and it seems wise to be cautious, to be tentative, to not assume too much.

This year, my partner and I are preparing ourselves for an orphans’ Christmas, well aware it’s unlikely at this late stage that we will be travelling to Queensland to see my parents. Our family Christmas has never been huge as both my parents are only children, but what they lack in size they make up for in sheer brio and eventfulness.

I haven’t always been loyal to the tradition, and some years I have traded the intensity of the family table for an overseas holiday. But this year — a year in which I have not seen my interstate family in close to 12 months — the absence of those familiar Christmas Day dynamics, the casual picking up from where we left off, will be keenly felt.

It’s OK, we tell ourselves. It will be me, you and the dog, my partner says. What more do we need? We will buy a real Christmas tree and let our home fill with the scent of pine needles. We will decorate the tree with fat Santas and pirouetting ballerinas, and we will see friends, of course, and eventually our families in the New Year. Plus, there will be carols by candlelight! Surely, not even Covid can derail the reassuring spectre of Marina Prior belting out Silent Night, as reliable as the tides.

Melbourne to reopen after more than four months of Covid lockdown Read more

I’ve experienced an orphan’s Christmas before, back when I lived in London more than a decade ago. Friends gathered at each other’s houses and phone calls were made — 10-minute catch-ups on expensive mobile plans back home to Australia or New Zealand or South Africa. Some ex-pats tearing up as they wished loved ones a happy Christmas, their voices catching in their throat, while the rest of us pretended not to notice, amping up the cheer.

This year it is likely that many Australians will be experiencing some iteration of an orphaned Christmas, unable to fly interstate or overseas to see loved ones but cobbling together some version of merriment that represents if not celebration then a relief that the worst of this year appears to be over. We will gather with as many as is safe to do — it could be more than we imagined, it could be fewer.

I will connect with my interstate family via Zoom; my parents and my brother and his family will be there. Three atomised Christmases – similar menus, barbs and traditions – played out in separate online silos.

My father’s terrible jokes will be missing. So too my mother’s generosity and insistence everyone enjoy themselves, that they eat more food.

Something else will be lost too: the feeling I enjoy with my brother once the second drink sets in, when we’ve advanced beyond polite enquiry and are sitting peaceably in companionable silence, that meditative space that exists between siblings.

I know I am not alone. Many of us will be apart when we need to pull together, and in that sense it will be very much a Christmas for our time, this terrible 2020, marked by longing, tiredness and a certain sweet relief at the end in sight.

NBA players approve plan to start 72-game season on 22 December,[],"The National Basketball Players Association voted Thursday to support the notion of starting this coming season on 22 December, the date that the league has been targeting in its talks about how and when to get teams back on the floor for a planned 72-game season.

The vote, conducted by the NBPA’s board – which has a player rep from each team, entrusted to speak on behalf of his teammates – is just another part of a lengthy process. Among the primary matters still to be determined: how much escrow will be taken from player salaries because of the shorter-than-usual season, and how the league and the players will navigate testing and other health and safety issues amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

All that has to be worked out before the plans for next season truly become official.

“Additional details remain to be negotiated and the NBPA is confident that the parties will reach agreement on these remaining issues relevant to the upcoming season,” the union said in a statement.

Talks between the NBA and NBPA on those and other topics are continuing, though there is obvious urgency to finalize things. The NBA draft is scheduled for 18 November and the plan presented to players – and now approved by the team reps – calls for training camps to begin on 1 December.

Free agency would almost certainly have to be wedged between the draft and the start of those camps, the league year would have to open, trades would have to become permissible again and some players need to be presented with deadlines by which they will have to either accept or decline options for this coming season.

The NBA wanted the 22 December start date over a mid-January notion for many reasons, revenue being foremost among them. A 72-game season, by league estimates, would allow for $500m more in revenue than a season of no more than 60 games – the mid-January option – would have provided.

The 22 December start also means that the NBA’s traditional Christmas schedule of games will be possible, something the league and its broadcast partners wanted. The season is also expected to conclude before the start of next summer’s Tokyo Olympics, meaning NBA player participation in those games remains possible."
Klopp ready for 'most difficult game in world of football' at Manchester City,['Andy Hunter'],"Jürgen Klopp has said Liverpool face the “most difficult game in the world of football” at Manchester City on Sunday despite their title rivals’ inconsistent start and the intense demands of a truncated season.

The Premier League champions can move eight points clear of Pep Guardiola’s team with victory at the Etihad Stadium, albeit having played one game more, after responding to the loss of Virgil van Dijk with five straight wins in all competitions.

City have yet to record back-to-back wins in the Premier League this season but Klopp, while dismissive of the suggestion Sunday’s game could have an impact on the title race, insists their threat and quality is undiminished.

“It is important that we have our own plan and not only think about their plan, that we are brave, we play football with all we have and then we have a chance,” said the Liverpool manager. “But it is very difficult. This is the most difficult game in the world of football I would say, to play against Manchester City.

“It is a very difficult game hopefully for both teams because both teams will perform on a high level. There are so many things that are different this season, nothing is to compare with last Nothing can compare with the year before. year. Everything is different and we just have to make sure we get through very intense periods, line up the fittest players, and play the best football we can.”

The rivalry between Liverpool and City has dominated the Premier League over the past two seasons and served up several memorable, high-calibre contests. Klopp believes his team must reproduce the clinical form that destroyed Atalanta 5-0 on Tuesday in the Champions League to record a first Premier League win at the Etihad since November 2015.

He added: “In England, with all the quality of the other teams and all the challenges in the game – what you have to be aware of and think about and what you have to do – it is City [who are most difficult to play] because they have a good plan, a clear plan and in each position a player who has the physicality and the technique to make a difference.

“They play a specific way, they are pretty dominant, but if they have to counterattack they are pretty strong so they have speed and creativity. They are in really good shape. If you don’t use all your chances that can cause you a problem results-wise. We just have to make sure it doesn’t happen on Sunday and they will not have that many (chances).”

Klopp, meanwhile, has congratulated Mamadou Sakho on winning his libel action against the World Anti-Doping Agency after it repeated false claims that the former Liverpool defender had taken a banned substance in March 2016. Sakho missed the 2016 Europa League final after receiving a provisional ban from Uefa, later overturned on appeal, and never played for Liverpool again.

The Liverpool manager commented: “We all knew for a long time already that Mama did nothing wrong. It was a massive, massive blow. Not only couldn’t he play the Europa League final but he couldn’t play in the Euros as well. I’m really happy for Mama that he at least now got the evidence that he did nothing wrong and it’s a very important thing.

“Doping is a problem yes, but I never really saw it as a problem in football because I’m 30 years in it and never was in contact with any kind of it. And if [there is], it’s because somebody made a silly decision not because they wanted to improve his recovery time or whatever. If you carry around the mark that you did doping, especially when you didn’t do it, that’s massive. So I’m really happy he’s freed of all of these things.”"
European challenge comes up short on opening day of Breeders' Cup,['Greg Wood'],"For the second year running, the European challenge on the first day of the Breeders’ Cup came up short on Friday, as second-place finishes for Aidan O’Brien’s Battleground and Mother Earth were the best that a strong list of contenders could muster.

Battleground finished strongly from well off the pace but was still three lengths adrift of Mike Maker’s Fire At Will in the Juvenile Turf, while Jessica Harrington’s Cadillac finished fourth in the same race.

Mother Earth, meanwhile, ran a similar race to Battleground’s behind the easy winner Aunt Pearl in the Juvenile Fillies’ Turf, with Miss Amulet, from Ken Condon’s stable in Ireland, back in third.

Bookmakers saw no reason to alter Battleground’s price for next year’s 2,000 Guineas and he remains the 10-1 joint-favourite for the Classic with his stable companion, St Mark’s Basilica. Mother Earth remains a 20-1 chance for the 1,000 Guineas.

It was a similar story of hitting the bar in the Juvenile Turf Sprint, where Ubettabelieveit, trained in Yorkshire by Nigel Tinkler, stayed on after a slow start to finish third, but the easy winner Golden Pal is a name to note for British backers as his trainer, Wesley Ward, is a regular at Royal Ascot and will consider a run in either the King’s Stand Stakes or the Commonwealth Cup next June.

Golden Pal recorded an explosive success, soon in front against the rail and then bursting clear in the stretch before being closed down in the final strides.

“He’s a wonderful colt to train,” Ward said. “I’ve had him since September of his yearling year, right from the sale here [at Keeneland].

“I’m so excited to take a horse like that and then just watch him emerge, every month that goes by, he’s like a young kid and you could tell he was an athlete. And then as we go through, as time goes on, the months go on, you could just see him just building stronger and stronger and really mentally coming together.

“It would be like a young quarterback that’s kind of a cocky young guy and then as we finally get to the end of the season, he’s really, really come together mentally. He’s just really a cool guy to be around.” Golden Pal was so fast through the early part of the race from a wide draw in stall 14 that the King’s Stand Stakes, over five furlongs, looks a more likely target than the Commonwealth Cup, which is restricted to three-year-olds but run over six furlongs.

“We’ll shut him down now,” Ward said. “That was always the plan. We’re going to finish the year off here and bring him back just after Christmas kind of start him back nice and easy and have him ready to go.

“They usually have a stakes here opening day for straight three-year-olds and that will usually tell us if we need another one before we get to Ascot, or that will be it until we get to Ascot and we’ll probably go for the King’s Stand. He was getting a little late there the last part, so he’s a lot better at five than six, but he’s just got such quality that he was able to sustain that extra 16th of a mile.”

On the dirt, Essential Quality was an impressive winner of the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile for the US arm of the Godolphin operation. Brad Cox’s colt powered past Jackie’s Warrior, the favourite, and Dreamer’s Disease just as the pair seemed set for a duel down the stretch, staying on strongly to suggest that the Kentucky Derby is a realistic target.

A first-day blank was disappointing for the travelling team but there are several big names on the card at Keeneland on Saturday, when nine races will make up the major afternoon at the meeting.

Kameko, the 2,000 Guineas winner, is likely to start favourite for the Mile, while Magical, Tarnawa and Mogul lead a strong European challenge for the Turf. Yorkshire could also be among the winners in Kentucky, as Glass Slippers, a Group One-winning sprinter from Kevin Ryan’s yard near Malton, is in the field for the Turf Sprint against a strong line-up of US-trained sprinters."
Rafael Nadal recovers to beat Carreño Busta and make Paris Masters semis,['Kevin Mitchell'],"Rafael Nadal beat Pablo Carreño Busta in three sets of gathering power on Friday night to reach the semi-finals of the Paris Masters, and simultaneously shoehorned Diego Schwartzman into the upcoming ATP World Tour Finals in London.

The Spaniard beat his compatriot 4-6, 7-5, 6-1, a few hours after the Argentinian collapsed in the first quarter-final in just over an hour against the mercurial Russian, Daniil Medvedev. Nadal has to get past Alexander Zverev on Saturday, while the other semi-final brings together Medvedev and Milos Raonic, who was impressive beating Ugo Humbert, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7).

Stan Wawrinka, the oldest player in the draw at 35 who came from a set down in his previous two matches, found 23-year-old Zverev too lively after a tough week. The world No 7 – distracted for days by allegations of abuse, which he denies, by an ex-girlfriend – remained focused long enough to win 6-3, 7-6 (1), in an hour and a half.

Although embarrassed by his own performance earlier in the day, Schwartzman was relieved to see Nadal win, as Carreño Busta was his only rival for the eighth and final spot at the O 2 Arena. The 18,000-seater opens its doors to the best eight players in the world – and very few others – on 15 November in the farewell edition of the tournament after 12 years in the capital before it moves to Turin for five years.

Novak Djokovic, who was officially declared end-of-year world No 1 for the sixth time on Friday, returns in London, along with Nadal, Medvedev, Schwartzman, Zverev, Andrey Rublev, Dominic Thiem and defending champion Stefanos Tsitsipas.

For all his humility, Nadal does not suffer much from self-doubt, but he must wonder in moments of introspection if, at 34, he will ever win this indoor hard court tournament. In seven attempts, the nearest he has got was his first visit in 2007, when David Nalbandian allowed him just four games in the final. “I think matches like yesterday and today help,” he said. “Semi-final here is a positive result for me. It’s been a long time since I played indoor hard.”

At 29, Carreño Busta is still striving for consistency at the highest level, but his racket did not quiver when he threaded a spectacular forehand crosscourt past Nadal to win a set off his compatriot for only the second time in seven encounters.

It took Nadal an hour and 17 minutes to get his first break point, which his friend and rival saved with his third ace. But, from that point on, Nadal steadily broke him down, levelling at 7-5 then, with heightened urgency, breaking to love in the fourth game of the decider.

Medvedev, oscillating up and down the top 10 this season, was back to his best in beating Schwartzman, 6-3, 6-1. “He didn’t show his best tennis,” Medvedev said. “It was good to win in such a short time, good preparation for London.”

Schwartzman, who broke into the top 10 for the first time a month ago after several impressive wins after the Tour resumed, was totally out of sorts. “I know that I did many things really bad, no defence, really horrible,” he admitted.

The second quarter-final was going the way of the first as Raonic’s big game threatened to overwhelm Humbert, but the young French left-hander found a rhythm to level at a set apiece. Humbert held his nerve to force the deciding tie-break, and Raonic saved match point in a 30-shot rally worth a standing ovation. It might have been the best point of the week.

Raonic dumped a simple return on his own match point but, after two hours and 18 minutes of an enthralling contest, Humbert’s statement sequence of eight wins in a row was over. Raonic, who has wandered in and out of the tennis wilderness, could not have finished on a more uplifting note.

“I wanted to make sure I didn’t leave the court without giving it my all,” he said of his fightback in the shootout. “I was creeping towards the edge there.”"
Che Adams helps Southampton beat Newcastle and top Premier League,['Ben Fisher'],"Earlier this week Ralph Hasenhüttl said he likes going under the radar but that will be increasingly difficult after Southampton surged to the top of the Premier League, moving to the summit of the English top flight for the first time since 1988.

Che Adams opened the scoring before Stuart Armstrong made sure of the points eight minutes from time as they brushed aside a desperately poor Newcastle to earn a third successive league win. After eight games, Southampton sit pretty on 16 points, a tally they did not accumulate until almost midway through last season. In fact, this time last year Southampton were toiling in the relegation zone with a goal difference of -17.

Danny Welbeck shines but Brighton are frustrated by Burnley in stalemate Read more

The transformation, overseen by Hasenhüttl, who again choreographed a frightening tempo from the touchline, has been remarkable. “It’s a bit scary what we’re doing at the moment,” said the Southampton manager. “We wanted to show ourselves that we are now one step ahead in our development.

“The result is a momentary top position in the table and it’s only for a few moments but it’s nice for the fans and for the players, to make a picture and enjoy it. For me it’s important not to lean back.” There is little danger of that. Southampton were relentless here, cajoled towards what their manager calls “the red zone”.

For Southampton, the big question was how they would fare without Danny Ings, their talisman who is set to miss around six weeks of action after undergoing minor knee surgery on Thursday. The simple answer was adeptly, with Adams rattling in on seven minutes, seconds after forcing the sprawling Karl Darlow into a smart save.

Darlow repelled Adams first time around but was overwhelmed by the striker’s first-time volley moments later. Adams finished emphatically from Theo Walcott’s crisp cross but it was the kind of the goal that had Steve Bruce tearing his hair out. Rather than hoofing the ball to safety, Miguel Almirón elected to try and twist and turn his way out of trouble. But, guilty of dallying on the edge of the 18-yard box, the excellent Kyle Walker-Peters harried the Newcastle midfielder before Walcott seized the ball and fed Adams.

Ings may have been their primary source of goals for the past couple of seasons but there is more substance to this Southampton team beneath the surface. They swaggered their way through periods of this match and Walcott twice went close to putting the gloss on an impressive shift upfront.

A few seconds after kick-off, a couple of fireworks splattered high behind the Northam End, usually home to a hardy travelling contingent. Here Newcastle played in fizzy yellow, as the kit manufacturers put it, but aside from Allan Saint-Maximin springing into life every now and then, Bruce’s side barely troubled Southampton.

For Newcastle, Callum Wilson limping down the tunnel with a hamstring complaint, 24 hours after a scan showed the absent Ryan Fraser has torn his hamstring, compounded a chastening evening. Sean Longstaff headed straight at McCarthy in the first half but Newcastle never threatened and that victory over Everton last Sunday was a distant memory. “The first goal summed us up,” said Bruce. “I think consistency is the big thing, which upsets me the most because we didn’t look anywhere near where we were five days ago. That inconsistency nags away at me. But unfortunately that inconsistency is something that has plagued me for the 15 months I’ve been here.”

At times Southampton were toying with Newcastle and when a simple pass was overcooked for Saint-Maximin, a frustrated Bruce scratched behind his ears and put his hands to his face.

Darlow did superbly to get fingertips to a Romeu piledriver and Lascelles cleared off the line after Jan Bednarek hooked the ball goalwards and a second goal eluded Southampton until late on. This time Longstaff was guilty of dawdling on the edge of the 18-yard box, inviting Armstrong to steal in and punish another lapse.

“Keep it there, let them run,” Hasenhüttl said, as Bednarek held possession just inside their own half. For much of the night Newcastle were chasing shadows."
Aaron Rodgers powers Green Bay Packers past undermanned 49ers,[],"Aaron Rodgers barely recognized this version of the San Francisco 49ers from the team that dominated Green Bay twice last season. But that doesn’t mean he was going to let up one bit.

Rodgers threw for 305 yards and four touchdowns and the Green Bay Packers overwhelmed the undermanned 49ers 34-17 on Thursday night.

“It was a different game,” Rodgers said. “They’re obviously depleted on both sides of the ball. They’ve had probably one of the worst injury years I’ve seen in a long time, so it’s not the same football team we saw twice last year, but they still have possibly the best middle linebacker in the game and a lot of pride. We went out and executed the way we expected to.”

Rodgers connected on deep shots to Davante Adams and Marquez Valdes-Scantling, and a short toss to Marcedes Lewis in the first half to get the Packers (6-2) out to a 21-3 lead over the Niners (4-5).

It was quite a reversal from the two meetings last season when San Francisco outscored Green Bay by a combined 50-0 in the first halves on the way to lopsided wins in the regular season and NFC title game.

The rematch looked nothing like those games in part because the Niners were missing almost all their key pieces from the game because of injuries and a positive coronavirus test for receiver Kendrick Bourne that also sidelined three of his teammates for “high risk” contacts.

That left San Francisco without quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo (ankle), All-Pro tight end George Kittle (foot), NFC title game star running back Raheem Mostert (ankle), receivers Deebo Samuel (hamstring) and Brandon Aiyuk (COVID-19 list), left tackle Trent Williams (Covid-19 list) and key defenders Nick Bosa (knee), Dee Ford (back) and Richard Sherman (calf).

“We knew it was going to be a challenge,” 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said. “We knew at the start of the week it would be a challenge. Losing those three guys yesterday would be a bigger challenge. I still thought we could have a game. ... I know we could have done better.”

Rodgers and the Packers, who were missing three players on the Covid-19 list, took advantage of the opportunity.

Rodgers capped the opening drive with a 36-yard shot to Adams, who made an acrobatic catch over Emmanuel Moseley in the end zone for his league-leading eighth TD reception of the season.

Nick Mullens had an apparent TD throw to River Cracraft wiped out on replay for San Francisco and then threw an interception to Raven Greene after backup left tackle Justin Skule got beat for a pressure from Preston Smith.

That mistake led to Rodgers’ 1-yard throw to Lewis and the Packers took control when Valdes-Scantling got behind the defense for the 52-yard catch late in the first half.

Rodgers added a second TD pass to Valdes-Scantling and the rout was on.

Adams finished with 10 catches for 173 yards, making him the first Packers player with three 150-yard receiving games since Donald Driver in 2006.

“I like getting the ball to 17,” Rodgers said about Adams. “He’s a special player. It started with the first drive. It didn’t look like from my vantage point he got in, but I could tell after the replay it was a good catch. He’s so talented. He does so many things for us. Easy guy to throw the ball to.”"
Battle for control: why the age-old console wars show no sign of stopping,['Keza Macdonald'],"It is an exciting time in video game world: two new consoles, the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, are arriving this month. With a long, lonely Covid winter ahead, it is tempting to splash out. New machines bring with them the promise of new worlds, as leaps in technology unlock creative possibilities for game developers. Throughout the 1980s, 90s and 00s, there was a transformational shift every five or so years, blowing apart people’s expectations of what you could do in a game, how big a virtual world could be and how you could explore it.

It is not quite like that any more. The pace of change has slowed and this time around the advances are less immediate and more subtle, more like tinkering under the bonnet: better resolution, higher frame rates, shorter loading times, smoother online features. Look at a PS5 game next to one from its predecessor, the PS4, and – unless you have a giant expensive TV and sound system – you might not immediately see the difference. It will take a few years for the creatives behind blockbuster games to unlock these machines’ full capabilities. But whoever gains early ground in the console war gets a bigger say in the future of gaming.

The Xbox Series X (£449) resembles a futuristic computer: a squat, black obelisk of technology. When you turn it on, though, it looks just like its predecessor, the Xbox One: same menus, same Windows-esque design. Even the controller is almost identical. It is when you start playing that you feel the difference: games are prettier and play more smoothly, and you only have to wait half as long for them to load. A smaller and less powerful version, the Xbox Series S (£249), has no disk drive and won’t look quite as good on a 4K TV, but both consoles come with the option of Xbox Game Pass, a monthly subscription that lets you play hundreds of games from Microsoft’s expanding library of partners.

The PlayStation 5 (also £449) is more of a design statement, a black-and-white, enormous spaceship of a thing. Its controller has futuristic features such as haptic feedback (super-precise rumble tech) and triggers that offer variable resistance depending on gameplay. Its revamped menus and home screen are slick and soothing. It has pretty much the same technical advantages as the Xbox but more personality. A £359 model comes without a disk drive, if you would rather download your games. It will work out as more pricey than the Xbox in the long run, though, as there is no Game Pass equivalent for new games: Sony’s subscription service, PlayStation Now, only includes games from the PS4 and earlier.

These two impressive bits of kit are the latest in a long line of rival video game consoles. The competitors have changed over the years – from Nintendo and Sega to Sony and Microsoft – but the console wars have been a constant in video game history, driving innovation as well as a lot of spending from players. Things really got going in the early 90s, when Sega hired Mattel’s former chief executive, Tom Kalinske, to take on Nintendo in North America, where Mario’s makers had 90% of the market. Aggressive ad campaigns followed (“Sega does what Nintendon’t!”) and a conscious effort to paint Sega as the cool older brother’s choice of console saw its Genesis win over millions of players.

But gaming rivalries had divided playgrounds even before Sonic v Mario. In 80s Britain, kids were split between the plucky-underdog ZX Spectrum, with its rubber keyboard and one-channel sound, or the fancier and much more expensive Commodore 64. You can still see men in their late 40s sniping at each other in comments threads over the pair’s relative merits.

In part, console tribalism is a form of sunk cost fallacy. Few people can afford to own two or more games machines, and if you have just spent a lot of money on something, you are going to convince yourself the one you’ve bought is the best option. But that is only part of the story. Like record labels or car manufacturers, games consoles have cultural associations. They create and curate their own different libraries of games, and for fans, the games they play correspond to the kind of person they perceive themselves to be.

For a while, Xbox had a reputation as the jock’s console, best for shooting and racing, while the PlayStation positioned itself as an extension of club culture, something for twentysomethings to play together after a night out. If you liked Japanese culture, you had to go for a Sega Dreamcast. If you loved Nintendo, it was because its games were approachable and colourful.

Ask people what drew them to their particular console subculture and you’ll get answers that probe every corner of the psychology of fandom and brand loyalty. Sooz Kempner is a comedian who has performed several shows that revolve around her Sega childhood and her obsession with its “edgy” mascot, Sonic the Hedgehog. “I thought Sonic was incredibly cool, zany and anti-establishment, whereas I decided Mario was staid and tepid, like John Major,” she says.

“Sonic and Sega gave me licence to sass people, [arguing that] Sega’s consoles were sleek and black whereas Nintendo’s were grey and blocky, Sega’s game soundtracks were edgy and guitar-led whereas Nintendo’s were plodding and childish. None of this was true, of course, but as a kid this was what I’d decided. I used to go around saying SNES controllers hurt my hands when I’d barely held one. I would draw cartoons of Mario getting his arse kicked by Sonic. Mean Machines, the very grown-up games magazine I sometimes bought, told me that Mortal Kombat on the Mega Drive had the gore effects but the SNES version did not. I crowed about this at school for a week.”

Despite Nintendo and Sega’s jostling, the next entrant in the console wars – Sony’s PlayStation in 1994 – blew both out of the water. By the end of the decade, Nintendo’s N64 was on the back foot while the Dreamcast flopped so badly that Sega stopped making consoles altogether. Since the debut of the original Xbox in 2001, it has been Microsoft and Sony at the forefront of the console wars, releasing competing devices within months of each other: first with the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in the 00s, then with the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in 2013, and now with the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. Nintendo, meanwhile, decided that warring over the cutting edge of entertainment was for suckers, and instead put out a series of comparatively underpowered consoles, most recently the Nintendo Switch, that cheerfully sold hundreds of millions of units.

“You can distinguish each firm’s strategy by looking at their DNA,” explains Joost van Dreunen, a professor at NYU Stern School of Business and the author of One Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games. “Nintendo is a toy company, Sony makes consumer electronics and Microsoft is a software firm. Nintendo has always excelled at accessible content. Sony has historically emphasised high-end spectacle that showcases the capabilities of its consoles, TV and audio systems. And Microsoft has dedicated itself to making games available to the largest possible audience on PCs, consoles and phones.”

Enormous sums of money await the victor in these battles. The best seller by far in the most recent console wars was the PS4: between 2013 and 2020, Sony sold 113m PlayStation 4s and more than 1bn games. Add in online gaming subscriptions and the amount of profit generated by that is … well, let’s just say that Sony’s games division is by far the most successful part of the entire company. The PlayStation’s biggest rival can’t match those numbers: estimates put the Xbox One’s total sales at around 50m, and Microsoft stopped reporting them years ago.

“Despite having been in the shadow of Sony, Microsoft’s second place has still allowed it to be hugely successful,” says Van Dreunen. “Bear in mind that Microsoft only relies on its gaming activity for about 10% of its overall revenue, compared to 27% for Sony. That makes Sony much more vulnerable to, and therefore motivated to invest in, its success in gaming.”

The stakes are high: video games are expensive to make and expensive to buy, and as Sega proved with the Dreamcast, failure can nearly wipe out a company. And, like music and film before it, the industry is facing huge changes to the way it does business. We have already seen some games become so big that they transcend the console wars entirely: think Fortnite or Minecraft, which people can play for years on end on whichever PC, console or even phone they have to hand. Instead of buying new games, plenty of players are just buying endless new content for the same games they already enjoy.

Apocalypse: wow … Ellie in The Last of Us Part II.

The real disruptive force, however, is Netflix-style game streaming, which could eliminate buying individual games entirely; instead, you’ll have to pay a subscription, like the Xbox Game Pass. It is telling that Microsoft has been on a huge spending spree in the past few years to build up a stock of tempting titles. Most recently, it bought the Elder Scrolls, Doom and Fallout publisher Bethesda, for an eye-watering $7.5bn (£5.8bn).

Google and Amazon have also been sniffing around the industry, buying up studios and launching subscription services of their own. This is not necessarily good news; these are giant companies known for barging in and undercutting everyone else, and if they upend the economics of the games industry then it is bound to have an effect on its creative output. Still, so far, they have not been successful. Google Stadia, which lets you stream games in high-end PC quality to any Chrome browser or TV, has been met with a big “meh” by consumers, and despite investing tens of millions in development, Amazon’s only game so far – competitive shooter Crucible – was such a failure that it was pulled just weeks after its release this May. The video game business is not for the faint-hearted, and throwing money around has historically rarely worked.

The thing is, despite all the fuss that surrounds the launch of new consoles, video games are not just about the hardware. They are about the entertainment that the technology enables. A console can have as many teraflops as it wants but without fun, envelope-pushing games to play on it nobody cares. Outside of the early adopters, most gamers are not that techy. We don’t buy a console because it has better specs; we buy it because it has the games we want to play. This is why Nintendo’s consoles sell like gangbusters despite their relative lack of power, and why millions more people play games on phones and ageing laptops than on cutting-edge machines.

Pent-up excitement will drive millions of sales of the PS5 and Xbox Series X in the coming months, but as history has proven several times over, in the end their success or failure will always come down to what you can play on them.

George Condo: 'Change can’t just be an idea or a slogan – it has to get real',['Nadja Sayej'],"The New York City artist George Condo has become New York state artist George Condo, a surprising move for someone so intensely intertwined with the city’s culture. The Hamptons is his new normal, after he ditched Manhattan in March.

Not that he is keeping track of time. “The month of May soon turned into August, which then turned into November,” Condo says to the Guardian from his studio later that day. “2020 is just the framing of the time lapse.”

It’s all a blur, much like his messy paintings, which are now on view at Hauser & Wirth in New York City. Internal Riot, opening this week, features 18 paintings and drawings, ranging from nightmarish splashes of insanity, to portraits of Virginia Woolf, Bugs Bunny and the rapper Travis Scott.

There are also a series of chaotic landscapes, depicting the artist’s own inner storm, which easily mirrors our own anxious moment. The show digs into self-isolation, madness and the divided disarray that America is today.

“The ‘divisive inequality of America’ is how I would describe it,” Condo corrects me. “It was always there, but now change can’t just be an idea or a slogan – it has to get real and fulfill the ideals it supposedly stands for.”

It ties into his trademark abstracted portraits, calling to mind Pablo Picasso’s cubism, but updated with an expressionistic, pop art flair, painted with a bold Disneyland palette, where outer conflict meets inner struggle.

Condo calls this style of painting “artificial realism” or “psychological cubism”. He describes it as tracing the thoughts of each character, capturing their overlaying, fluctuating moods with a paintbrush.

“People are torn apart in and of themselves, barely human at times,” said Condo. “You can see a person trying to break free from a structure and become whole again.”

The new works in this show – all made in 2020 – range from Father and Daughter with Face Mask, two freaked-out figures all masked up, Hysteria, a figure screaming in the dark, and There’s No Business Like No Business, which depicts a sad, solitary figure in distress (it calls to mind all the small business owners in New York who have closed up shop).

And his own mirror? What does Condo see when he looks in the mirror today? Just look at his latest painting entitled Internal Riot. On a crimson red background, it looks as though a man is yelling at himself.

What does the creator see when he looks at it? “A combination of images scrambled up from newscasts and footage of the riots that took place across America,” he says. “It’s the desire to relentlessly pursue the perpetrators who inhabit the periphery of the mind and root them out.”

The artist came into the spotlight after befriending Jean-Michel Basquiat in the 1980s, which led to him working at Andy Warhol’s Factory in New York. He then fled to Paris, where he lived and painted for years, and outraged the UK with his ghastly portrait of the Queen as a scabby-looking monster in 2006. He then returned to New York, where he painted Allen Ginsberg’s final portrait in the hospital before he died. Up until March, Condo was living on the Upper East Side.

He’s well versed in the rap world. Condo painted the album cover for Kanye West’s 2010 album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and shortly after, painted a Hermès Birkin bag for Kim Kardashian West (West has shown his face at Condo’s studio and museum openings). Even Jay-Z name-dropped Condo’s name in a rap song (“Condos in my condo I want a row of”), from his 2013 album Magna Carta Holy Grail.

But for now, Condo is alone, revelling in solitude. Be it good or bad, it reminds him of his childhood, growing up in a small New England town.

“I would spend hours in my room alone painting, not even knowing there was such a thing as what we call ‘the art world’,” he said. “So, it feels a bit like that, where I am totally out of touch with everything for purposes of safety and health.

“There’s nothing to do but create art.”

Condo’s latest work can be seen as a continuation of his online exhibition from April called Drawings for Distanced Figures, which featured ink, pencil and crayon figures capturing the paranoia, fear and panic brought on by the onslaught of 2020.

“It is an eerily existential feeling knowing that you are somehow existing in the absence of a familiar world,” he adds. “It is very isolating at times, and my moods change with the weather.”

While each character represents a different mental state or mood, they also act as visions of what it’s like to be living in this very moment. “Fractured portraits tell us about the multiple emotions we are experiencing, all at the same time,” he says. “They mirror the normal person in today’s world. I suppose this is the new normal.”

It’s hard to imagine one of New York’s most iconic artists gone without any plans to return. “I had a feeling the country was not prepared to handle it, and it wouldn’t be healthy to stay there,” said Condo. “Knowing that once I left, I would be stuck, I felt I was doing the right thing, regardless of how isolating it might become.”

After eight months away, he finally returned to New York City, “to look around”, he says, then left again. “It’s just not the same any more to be dependent on anything, other than oneself.”

Condo reached a breaking point at the end of May (around the time George Floyd was killed). He painted a piece entitled The End of May 2020, depicting a portrait of a figure immersed in trouble and darkness.

“It was a cracked head with a splat of gold thrown in its face,” as Condo describes it. “It certainly did express my own crazed mental state, at that point.”

The three things that have kept him grounded in quarantine are this: staying away from the news, making art and keeping loved ones close. “I’ve had frequent visits by my partner Leila Josefowicz, with whom I started a film project about art and music,” said Condo. “It was nice to have just one visitor every week or two for a couple days.

“In between, I just drive around listening to Jimi Hendrix full blast in my car,” he says. “In the Hamptons, the trees, the ocean and the fish store help, too.”

In terms of where his compass points him next, it all comes down to politics. “The migratory sense, in my mind, has to do with the fight-or-flight instinct,” says Condo. “And I honestly believe many people in this country feel that if Trump wins again, they want to leave and move somewhere else.”

Condo has an understandably bleak view of what’s been happening of late. “I think that perception and comprehensible information based in truthful reality is what has been burned to the ground,” he says. “Answers are lit on fire like burning leaves in the wind. Nobody really has any facts.”

Despite the current dystopian storm, Condo is looking forward to 2021 with a slice of hope, though. “I think the outcome of the election will have a huge impact on the basic state of the world,” he said.

“I just hope to continue making art in a healthier environment, and most of all, that my kids can take what they’ve learned from these horrible times of suffering and move forward in a more optimistic and healthy world.”"
Play with the format: how theatre shows are dispensing with the stage,['Natasha Tripney'],"Since mid-March, theatre-makers have been faced with a dilemma: how do you continue to make art when conventional theatre, the performing of stories to audiences in dark rooms, is not pandemic-compatible? Some were quick to embrace the shift to digital, while others resisted. A few suggested that maybe it was best to just stop making theatre at all for the time being, until things returned to normal. This, though, did not take into account the fact that artists still need to eat, and that retraining as a coder isn’t an option for many, despite what Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives might believe.

New work started to appear. In the beginning there were a lot of monologues; short, self-filmed pieces in the main. Then, as video-conferencing became the primary tool for talking to colleagues and friends, the Zoom play took off. US playwright Richard Nelson wrote a series of new pieces for his pre-existing characters, the Apple family, with the siblings sharing snippets of their Covid-19 existence; while the innovative Belarus Free Theatre – whose politically exiled co-founders are a step ahead of most, having been creating work remotely for years – produced an ambitious live Zoom adaptation of the Russian novel A School for Fools, featuring props from their apartments, drone footage and accidental cat cameos.

However, as it became apparent that conventional performance would not be possible for some time to come, it turned out that Zoom plays were just the beginning. Theatre-makers have had to become more inventive, to explore different platforms and new forms of storytelling. Over the past months, we have seen audio theatre, video theatre, phone theatre, WhatsApp theatre and even, in the case of recent Derry performance Playcraft Live, Minecraft theatre.

Terry O’Donovan and Daphna Attia’s theatre company Dante or Die repurposed its site-specific 2018 Edinburgh fringe show, User Not Found, as an “immersive video podcast”. Designed to be experienced on your phone and listened to via headphones, the new version uses a mix of dreamy soundscape and intimate narration to tell a story about grief and our digital afterlife. Making work in this way has the capacity to reach more people. While the live version of the production, performed in a cafe, was seen by a maximum of 50 people a night, the video podcast has been experienced by more than 5,500.

But is it theatre? For Attia, this moment has created “an opportunity to start telling stories in new ways using the digital”. It is possible, she says, for a work “to be theatre and an installation and a piece of art. The mainstream theatre sector has been quite rigid for a long time but the fringes have always been playing around with form, experimenting with audio, digital, live art, journeys that don’t conform to what ‘theatre’ is for many people.” One person watching User Not Found reported the impulse to pick up her phone and comfort it during one particularly emotive moment. “Some friends pressed ‘play’ at the same time as each other and enjoyed feeling like they were connected,” says Attia.

Phones are also central to the French director Samuel Sené’s show C-o-n-t-a-c-t, already something of an international hit, performed at locations around London and Europe. Audience members download an app that allows them to listen in, via headphones, on a group of actors as they move through the city’s streets, telling a story about urban isolation and guardian angels. It feels like digital eavesdropping: you can hear the performers’ every breath and thought, while watching from a safe distance.

Visitors, the new audio experience by Darkfield’s Glen Neath and David Rosenberg, is designed for two people to experience together in their own home. Neath and Rosenberg have been experimenting with making work outside auditoriums for 25 years, most recently via their often terrifying shipping container experiences Flight and Séance, 15-minute events that use a mix of binaural sound and blanketing darkness to capture the terror of being on a plane on the verge of crashing, or the sense of being trapped in close quarters with a malevolent spirit. This made them better placed than most to adapt.

Their new audio shows have been created using a similar process to their previous work. The intention is still to create “a doubt as to what is real or imagined”, says Rosenberg. They believe the work still has the feel of live events in that “there is still a shared experience albeit with the smallest amount of moving parts: two people in their home”. But it is as much radio as theatre. “The immersion works in a way that is close to reading, as the experience is so dependent on the imagination of the audience,” says Neath.

The fact that theatre is both the word for an artform and the building that houses that artform can be an obstacle, Rosenberg says, in that it creates a set of expectations. Increasingly now, artists are turning their attention from the stage to the home, where they need to compete with television and other distractions. The first hurdle, says Rosenberg, is getting people “to carve out a temporary bolthole where the endlessly pervasive grasps of our attention are weakened”.

After the tour of her 2019 Edinburgh fringe show All of Me was cancelled, theatre-maker Caroline Horton, whose shows often explore mental health issues, was reluctant to simply release a video version of her latest show, as others were doing. The show’s director, Alex Swift, suggested they instead try Twine, an interactive storytelling platform, though Horton confesses she had no idea what Twine was until then. All of Me is about the experience of depression, and Twine’s “choose your own adventure” format offered interesting narrative possibilities. In a show about cycles of recovery and relapse, it was now possible to create a sense of endless looping that can be difficult to fully capture on stage. “If the player makes certain choices you can get stuck in a loop where you keep going to the supermarket and buying vodka.”

“I had to go back to the script and pull it apart,” says Horton, who has been discovering how something as small as a change in font or background colour can shift the experience for the player. Twine also offers its users a sense of agency. “With Twine, you can dip in and out in a way you can’t with a theatre experience. You’re in control of that.” While small in form, Twine is not dissimilar to Netflix’s interactive Black Mirror experiment Bandersnatch and the work of immersive theatre giants Punchdrunk, whose ambitious crossover project The Third Day just premiered on Sky Atlantic, in that the audience member becomes a participant.

One of the first actual back-in-a-theatre productions was the Donmar Warehouse’s adaptation of José Saramago’s Blindness, a novel about a planet-sweeping disease that renders people blind. It was billed as a “socially distanced sound installation”, created with theatre’s go-to sound designers Max and Ben Ringham. Having conceived it in pre-coronavirus times, the director Walter Meierjohann had envisioned an epic production with a massive cast and community choir, but he ended up creating a show with no live actors, in which masked, distanced audience members listened to a pre-recorded monologue by Juliet Stevenson. “It was very intimate and, actually, as an audience member you felt very much part of the action, although you’re just sitting there.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest All the world’s a screen … Illustration: Phil Hackett

In the theatre, you are always working with restrictions, says Meierjohann, be they budgetary or spatial. That is not new and there’s something creatively energising about it: the National Theatre built temporary venue The Shed while its studio was being refurbished, and in the process created one of London’s most exciting spaces.

Blindness is not theatre in the strictest sense, as it lacks the element of live performance, says Meierjohann. The narration is fixed, like a film. “But it was all about coming together again. We were one of the first who were able to do that and it felt extremely important.”

On the other hand, he says, the current situation is also desperately sad. “The first preview was extraordinarily moving because, suddenly, we have people in the space again.” Now, just as suddenly, those people are gone.

With a second lockdown upon us, perhaps more theatre-makers will take pointers from the first one. The last few months have greatly expanded our sense of what theatre can be, and how and where we can experience it. Even when faced with a global pandemic, theatre-makers will always find new ways to tell stories, proving that adaptability is the essence of theatre. Maybe Rishi should pay closer attention.

"Singer, activist, sex machine, addict: the troubled brilliance of Billie Holiday",['Alex Godfrey'],"There’s an electrifying moment in Billie, a new documentary about Billie Holiday, when Jonathan “Jo” Jones, a tempestuous, influential African American drummer who played with Holiday from the 1930s to 50s, challenges his white interviewer. “You don’t know what we was going through then,” he says, referring to travelling through the deep south on Count Basie’s tour bus. “What were you going through?” asks the interviewer, Linda Lipnack Kuehl. “We was going through hell!” he shouts. “Miss Billie Holiday didn’t have the privilege of using a toilet in a filling station. The boys at least could go out in the woods. You don’t know anything about it because you’ve never had to subjugate yourself to it. Never!”

James Erskine’s film is constructed entirely from such interviews by Kuehl, a high-school teacher and Holiday fan with a sideline in arts journalism. In 1971, she began plans for a biography: Holiday had died aged 44 in 1959 and, 11 years on, Kuehl wanted to speak to those who were there throughout her life. She interviewed and interviewed and was still finding people in 1978 – almost 200 of them in all. The project overwhelmed her and she never finished it, and in 1979 she was found dead on a Washington sidewalk. Police deemed it suicide, Kuehl having supposedly jumped from her hotel room, although there was no proof of this.

Her interviews found their way to a private collector and were later used in other writers’ biographies of Holiday. More recently, documentary director Erskine bought the rights to Kuehl’s tapes. His film is a journey through Holiday’s life, narrated by the voices on those tapes – eyewitnesses to one of the 20th century’s most remarkable artists.

“The first tape we put on was Charles Mingus,” Erskine says now of hearing Kuehl’s interviews. “Immediately we were transported back to the 1950s through that deep voice. A way of talking that’s like music itself, an unguardedness, but also a documentary eye. It really felt like you were back there in Chicago in the 50s, with all the greats of jazz there, Ella [Fitzgerald] waiting in the wings as Billie performs. It was intoxicating.”

Listening to musicians, lovers, pimps, childhood friends and FBI agents recounting their time with Holiday is an evocative and transportive experience. We hear Kuehl, too, a great interviewer who cut through the gloss. It is a raw, unsanitised character study, in which Holiday is both combative and vulnerable, coy and revolutionary: a fiery, foul-mouthed thrill-seeker who never sacrificed her integrity. This is all the more refreshing considering that Holiday’s estate, acquired in 2012 by music company Concord, came on board as producers. “What I love about the film is we’re not changing who she was,” says Michele Smith, who manages the estate. “We’re not changing her flaws. She’s unapologetically Billie. She only knows how to be her.”

The testimonials are riotous. “She came down one night between shows and said, ‘Pick me up tonight!’” says John Simmons, who played bass with her, took drugs with her and slept with her. “And, as I was walking in the door, she was walking out the door with a chick. But the next night … she collected me. She would go off with a chick, or something like that; she’d probably make them perform a three-ring circus. After that she’d probably go off and get a prostitute. She was a sex machine.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘The government went after her’ ... Billie Holiday. Photograph: New Black Films

The film doesn’t shy away from such material, or the lifetime of abuse Holiday suffered. This is vital, says Smith. “A lot of people just think of her addictions but don’t know about her upbringing. You cannot judge her without knowing who she really is. She was born in the United States in 1915 as a poor black girl, growing up to be a woman who has been sexually assaulted, raped at 10 years old, then tried to find a place for herself in this world.”

Through Kuehl’s interviews we hear first-hand about Holiday’s awful husbands and boyfriends, a rogues’ gallery of exploiters and abusers, men who would knock her out in the street. Holiday would fight back: “She hit him over the head with a Coke bottle or something and kinda laid his head open, and they both went to the hospital,” says trombonist Melba Liston of one such episode. But these men squeezed the life out of her, chipping away at her confidence, physically and mentally beating her down.

“She did not make all the best choices,” Smith says. “But you have to understand why she was a certain way.” As well as her childhood trauma, “she wasn’t allowed to go to restaurants, to use restrooms, because she wasn’t treated as a full human”.

The film documents this racism. She wasn’t allowed to enter venues via the front doors, lest she offend the white clientele who were there to see her; she spent months touring the south with Artie Shaw’s white band, in which she had to hunt down hotels to sleep in, barred from the ones the rest of the band stayed in. “After we would eat she always ordered an extra hamburger and she’d put that in her purse, because she never knew when she would not be able to be served,” a friend says in the the film.

This was compounded by Holiday’s decision to sing Strange Fruit, the protest song presented to her by writer Abel Meeropol in 1939. In the film, Barney Josephson, the owner of the non-segregated club Café Society, where she first performed it, details how some white people, “one party after another”, would file out of the place as she did so. Holiday had it written into her contract that she would be singing the song, at every concert, everywhere. The FBI began chasing her – ostensibly for drug offences – soon after that.

“From 1939 to her death in 1959 the government went after her because she was black, she was wealthy and she dared to sing Strange Fruit,” Smith says. Holiday herself said that, in May 1947, she was ordered not to sing it at a concert in Philadelphia. That night, narcotic agents raided her hotel room and, as she returned from the gig, shot at Holiday’s car as she saw them and sped off. She was later arrested and sentenced to a year’s imprisonment.

FBI files in 1949 stated that Holiday has been discredited to set an example to others. One of the agents, Colonel George White, told Kuehl that Holiday’s “fancy coats and fancy automobiles and her jewellery and her diamonds” generated much resentment.

“They made her public enemy number one and destroyed her life in a lot of ways,” says Smith. Literally, some would say. Holiday died due to cirrhosis of the liver, caused by alcohol abuse, but, arguably, she was driven to death by two decades of persecution. Even at the end she was arrested in her hospital bed for possession of narcotics.

Sadly, it all seems relevant. “We finished the film last year and I didn’t see it again until September,” says Erskine. “I was shocked at how political it felt. When we were making it, we felt that we were presenting truths about things that everybody understood, the white man’s power, structural racism. I was setting out to make a film about Billie, and one of the joys of it is that you get to really see her. But I guess it tells us that we haven’t really addressed any generational wounds in society.”

Mostly though, he says, “if the film feels relevant it’s because she feels relevant. She talks about sex, about race, about violence, issues that are right at the heart of how we communicate today, and she doesn’t talk about them on the back foot. Billie Holiday got up and sang Strange Fruit in 1939, then pretty much every night of her life for 20 years. She was incarcerated for it, and she sang it to white audiences, and this was 16 years before Rosa Parks.”

Holiday had no idea of what the long-term effects of singing Strange Fruit would be: imprisoned for a year because of a drug charge; permanently banned from singing in venues that served alcohol, thus wiping out a vast amount of future income and forcing her to tour endlessly until she died. Yet, says Smith, she would not compromise. “She knew by singing it that she was going to lose a lot. And she did. With the civil rights movement in the 60s people lost their lives, and in essence she lost her life by singing this song.”

That, she says, on top of the music, is why Holiday’s legacy has endured. “She knew her place. And sometimes she didn’t want to stay in her place. That’s why she’s Billie Holiday – she was a fighter. And, as an icon, she has survived.”

Jo Jones summed it up. “How did she take it?” he replied, when Linda Kuehl asked how Holiday dealt with segregation. “Fuck it! She’d go in and sing! Go and fuck ’em! She did what she did until she died.”

It’s been a slog of a week for America: a drawn-out presidential election count, during a surging pandemic, with still no clear winner as late-night shows taped on Thursday night. The Late Show aired after Donald Trump spoke from the White House and “tried to poison American democracy”, said host Stephen Colbert. Still on his election special set, Colbert wore all black, “dressed for a funeral”, he said, “because Donald Trump tried really hard to kill something tonight” with a 15-minute rant so full of lies and attempts to discredit the electoral process that even network news, finally, cut away.

Colbert planned for a somber evening, he added, not because he’s “a prophet, it’s just that he’s so predictable. For weeks, we’ve been talking about how there’d be a ‘red mirage’, and how all those outstanding Biden mail-in ballots might let Joe catch up, and then Trump would probably come out around, I don’t know, Thursday? Maybe evening news time, and pretend that he won and accuse everyone else of cheating. The guy does not have another gear, get a new act!”

Donald Trump has always been clear with his intentions, Colbert continued, rolling a clip of the president from 20 October 2016: “I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election – if I win.”

“So we all knew he would do this,” said a visibly emotional Colbert, who took a long pause. “What I didn’t know is that it would hurt so much. I didn’t expect this to break my heart. For him to cast a dark shadow on our most sacred right, from the briefing room in the White House – our house, not his – that is devastating.”

The usually affable host urged, sans jokes, Americans to take in and reject Trump’s attempt to unlawfully grab power, including congressional Republicans. “For all the predictable behavior of the last few days, and the last four years, right now something unpredictable needs to happen: Republicans have to speak up. All of them. Because for evil to succeed, all that is necessary is for good men to do nothing.

“So say something right now, Republicans,” he added. “Not later, not after you’ve stuck your finger up in the wind or wherever you want to put it. Right now.”

Colbert concluded with a call for Republicans to acknowledge “everything that was obvious to so many of us” – namely, that “Donald Trump is a fascist. And when it comes to democracy v fascism, I’m sorry, there are not fine people on both sides. So you need to choose: Donald Trump or the American people.”

Jimmy Kimmel

“Please stay calm, the process is working,” urged Jimmy Kimmel on Thursday night, as counters continued to process ballots in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona. “We are watching a president bleed out in real time right now.”

Kimmel refused to air any clips from Trump’s lie-filled non-concession: “I won’t give him the pleasure of showing what he said tonight,” he said. “But the only thing he didn’t do was pull off his wig and reveal that he’s been Vlad Putin all along. It was a litany of lies, threats, just a litany of despicable and incoherent attacks on democracy in the United States.

“At the end of that speech, he should’ve been arrested,” Kimmel said. “If they could’ve found handcuffs small enough to take him away, they would have.”

Seth Meyers

On Late Night, Seth Meyers dismantled the various and contradictory attempts to stop or recount votes by the Trump campaign. “No one is buying these false declarations of victory, in part because even the Trump team can’t keep their bullshit straight,” Meyers said. “In Pennsylvania, they want to stop the count while they’re ahead; in Arizona, however, they’re suddenly concerned that the counting will stop while they’re behind. If you thought Trump’s ghouls had plumbed the depths of their shamelessness, think again.”

Meyers pointed to Trump surrogates Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who appeared on Fox News on Thursday to demand votes still be counted in Arizona, where Trump was behind. “You almost gotta applaud their ability to pivot on a dime from one brazen lie to another contradictory lie,” he said, “but hey, you heard it, from the president’s closest and most trusted advisers: ‘Let’s take our time and count the votes.’ And we agree: count every vote, in every state, everywhere.”

An hour later, however, Donald Trump tweeted: “STOP THE COUNT!” – evidence that “trying to stay on message with Trump is like trying to ride a mechanical bull slathered in olive oil”, joked Meyers.

Trevor Noah

And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah also mocked the Trump campaign’s incoherent arguments for a Trump victory, as his supporters shouted “count the votes” and “stop the count” at protests in different states. “I can’t believe we were all terrified that Trump supporters would coordinate a civil war, and yet these guys can’t even agree on a slogan to shout in the streets,” Noah joked.

“Because they’re chanting to count the votes if Trump is behind in the state, but then if he’s ahead, then they’re chanting to stop the count. I mean, what happens if the state switches?

“But if Trump can’t win the election in the streets, he has one final plan: to win the election in the tweets,” Noah added, pointing to Trump’s wholly unsupported claim, on Twitter, that he won in Michigan. “Come on, Donald, what are you doing, man? Just because you shout it doesn’t mean it’s yours. This is the election, not riding shotgun,” Noah said.

Noah added: “Isn’t it ironic that Trump spent months warning that rioters were going to loot all the stores, but now he’s the one trying to loot the electoral college.”"
Sophia Loren: 'The body changes. The mind does not',['Xan Brooks'],"The 86-year-old, star of the Netflix drama The Life Ahead, looks back at her own life, from the squalor of wartime Naples to the glamour of international fame

The CGI lioness that materialises at intervals in the Netflix drama The Life Ahead is a sad and sorry-looking thing. It has a glossy gold coat and a twitching gold tail and brings a dose of magic realism to an otherwise gritty 21st-century tale. But it is too skimpy and tame. It lacks exoticism and menace. It pales when compared to the movie’s other big beast.

Ostensibly, The Life Ahead spins the story of Madame Rosa, a fiery samaritan and former sex worker on the coast of southern Italy. But in essence, at heart, it is a luxurious showcase for the 86-year-old Sophia Loren, who strides through the action with her grey hair untethered and her hoop earrings swinging; a Mother Courage for the ages, bruised but unbowed. Directed by her son, Edoardo Ponti, the film mines the actor’s back catalogue, riffs off her colourful life story and stirs memories of the combative characters she played in her heyday, in films such as Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow (1963) and Marriage Italian Style (1964). “Things don’t change too much,” she says. “The body changes. The mind does not.”

The plan had been to premiere the picture in Rome. But then the pandemic intervened, which is why they are having to launch it from the living room of Loren’s house in Geneva, mother and son sat side-by-side at a laptop with the french doors to the garden open at their backs. The Zoom connection is spotty. The image keeps freezing. Ponti is amused, but Loren is borderline exasperated, pining for the old pomp and ceremony. She is still big; it’s just the pictures that got small.

Every major actor carries with them the trace of their earlier films or their personal history. But in the case of The Life Ahead, the evidence feels more obvious, and more lovingly arranged. Romain Gary’s source novel set the tale in Paris. Ponti, though, relocates it to the Adriatic port city of Bari, which he depicts as a rambunctious hurly-burly of Muslims and Jews, saints and sinners, and migrants of all stripes. The place made me think of John Steinbeck’s Cannery Row but it is also not dissimilar to Loren’s hometown of Pozzuoli, near Naples. And this has to be at least part intentional.

She pulls a face. “Yes, in a way,” she concedes. “But Pozzuoli is in the past. I lived there during the war, so it’s impossible to compare. Back then, we didn’t have anything. It was hunger, it was war. Everything was against us. We could have died every night.”

‘Even when she was 80 she was timeless but somehow quite sexy’ Eduardo Ponti recalls his grandmother, Sophia Loren's mother

It occurs that Loren’s impoverished upbringing – as an illegitimate child in war-torn Catholic Italy – is as much a part of her legend as the fame and fortune that came later, so much so that it is sometimes difficult to separate the fiction from the fact. It is widely assumed that Peter Sarstedt’s 1960s hit single Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)? (raggedy children; the backstreets of Naples) was about Loren, despite Sarstedt swearing blind that it wasn’t. I have also read that Loren’s mother used to siphon water from the car radiator, just so she was able to give her starving daughter a drink. But this nugget, too, turns out to be false.

“No, no, no,” says Loren, briefly exasperated all over again. Then a further thought hits her. “What car?” she demands. “We didn’t have a car.”

Her mother, Romilda Villani, was an aspiring actor herself. She won a Greta Garbo lookalike competition and might have gone to the US to work as Garbo’s body double. But events made such a move impossible. She had two kids and no money. Her faithless middle-class lover – the father of her daughters – had all but cut her loose. So Romilda stayed in Naples and it was Sophia who achieved lift-off.

In The Life Ahead, Loren plays Madame Rosa as an exhausted survivor. She is a proponent of hard knocks, a dispenser of tough love. At some point during filming she realised she was channelling Romilda. “My mother’s feelings were all closed off inside herself,” she explains. “I was allowed to be a part of it, never in a good way, never like mother and daughter.”

Ponti chips in. The woman was his grandmother; he has his own perspective. What he most remembers about Romilda was her resilience, her combination of fragility and strength. Those are the qualities that Loren shared with Romilda. “She had a dignity in the way she carried herself. A vitality I remember even when she was 80. She was timeless but somehow quite sexy, despite her age,” he says.

An amateur psychologist might be tempted to view Loren’s career as a realisation of her mother’s dashed dreams. But that is getting the wrong end of the stick. If anything, she says, it was her father not her mother who was the real motivation. She longed for the secure, moneyed life that she felt was her birthright. “I wanted to be able to walk into the kind of places my father walked into. I wanted to understand what it was like to live like he did. I wanted reasons. I wanted answers.” She gives an angry shrug: “But I got nowhere.”

At the 1950 Miss Italia beauty pageant, the 15-year-old first met Carlo Ponti, a film producer who was only two years younger than her mother (they became lovers four years later). Again, it is tempting to regard Ponti as the adult protector she craved. Again, she is having none of it. “I don’t like the word protector,” she says. “It was more that he believed in me.”

It was Ponti, though, who changed her name and moulded her image. Ponti defended her against the Hollywood executives who insisted that her nose was too large and her lips were too full and who, in marketing her as “the Italian Marilyn Monroe”, somehow managed to do a disservice to both actors. And it was Ponti who helped plot her trajectory, so that she landed on the scene like some visitor from another planet; comically gorgeous and dizzyingly versatile, as comfortable in heated melodrama as she was in freewheeling light comedy. Her life turned around and caught her by surprise. She feels that, in hindsight, her harsh early years were a blessing in disguise. Whatever came next could only count as an improvement.

I suggest that her mother must have been cock-a-hoop. “Not at first. She was against new things. She thought I would never be successful, and that was wrong, she was wrong. Later she started to believe that I could maybe be somebody. But it was always a big maybe. To her, the life that I wanted, it was all a dream. And she didn’t believe in dreams.”

The problem, perhaps, was that Loren was so gung-ho in the pursuit of stardom that her mother started to fear for her daughter’s safety. How she would cope if it didn’t happen. How she would cope if it did. “I think maybe she was afraid I would get into a world where I didn’t belong,” she says. “And in a way she was right.”

It was difficult because so many things came in the middle. But still my life was with Carlo Ponti, not with Cary Grant

I am intrigued by Loren’s fleeting Hollywood era in the late 1950s, as a contracted player at Paramount Pictures. This feels like the crossroads, her moment of flux. Ponti, her mentor, was briefly out of the picture and she had a relationship with Cary Grant that sparked on the set of The Pride and the Passion and sputtered during the filming of the 1958 romcom Houseboat. So here was the dream; big as life, full of money. But, as with most dreams, it was chaotic, confusing and not altogether to be trusted.

The way Loren tells it, Hollywood was a mere detour, a nice little adventure, never intended to last. “I mean, yes, I would have liked to learn English and know people in America. But at that time I was – how you say? – fiancee-ing with Carlo. And marriage and children: that was my dream as well.”

I feel we could use her son’s thoughts at this point. He is integral to the story. “Well, yes,” he says. “I’m very grateful she went back to Italy and married my father. I wouldn’t be here otherwise.”

I ask what the deciding factor was. What was it that made her choose Italy over Hollywood, Ponti over Grant? Her son translates the question and she directs her answer to him. “Because I was in love with your father!”

“To him, Mama,” Ponti murmurs.

She wheels back to the screen. “Because I was in love with his father! Very much so. My life since we met … my life was with him. And it was difficult because of so many things that came in the middle. But still my life was with Carlo, not with Cary Grant.”

“My mother has always been very close to her roots,” Ponti says. “Her roots run very deep. So I do understand the choice of going back to my father, because he represented everything she knew, the country she loved. He was a man whose emotional language she understood.”

Loren has always defined herself as a Neapolitan first and an Italian second. I ask what the difference is and she laughs at my ignorance and says it would take too long to explain. “Naples is so strong, so vital. It’s about music and dance. Books and books of history. Read all the books first and then we can talk.”

The evidence suggests that she made the right choice. Europe provided more fertile ground for her skills. In 1962, she won the best actress Oscar for her turn in the potent wartime drama La Ciociara (Two Women), shot in 1960 by the neorealist director Vittorio De Sica. Loren played Cesira: widowed shopkeeper, embattled mother, a symbol of Italian fortitude and resilience. It is the film that, six decades on, she still considers her favourite, the one that mapped out the ground and pointed the way forward. It is not hard to join the dots from Cesira, through Filumena in Marriage Italian Style, Giovanna in Sunflower, all the way to the redoubtable Madame Rosa in The Life Ahead.

Personally, too, the return to her homeland proved fruitful. She and Ponti remained together until his death in 2007. Edoardo tells me that, growing up, he never saw his parents as a powerhouse couple, “Honestly, it was never about stardom or glamour. It was always about the craft. My parents, if anything, were more like artisans. It was like they were a pair of Italian shoemakers.”

Today, over Zoom, she doesn’t come across as your average cobbler. She is decisive, imperious, a natural-born thoroughbred with her eye on the prize. While The Life Ahead is Loren’s first feature film in a decade, she bridles at the notion that it might be described as a comeback, or a curtain call. She says acting is her life, is all that she knows, and that therefore she sees no particular reason to quit. “Sophia for ever,” she says with a smile.

I ask if she has ever felt lost, or beset by self-doubt, and she considers the question for all of two seconds. “Yes, well, maybe sometimes. But then I say to myself: ‘Shut up. Be strong. Just keep going and try. Sometimes you make mistakes and sometimes you win.’ I made some mistakes,” she shrugs. “But still I won.”"
"The Mandalorian recap: season two, episode two – watch out, giant ice spiders are about!",['Paul Macinnes'],"Spoiler alert: this blog is published after The Mandalorian is released on Disney+. Do not read unless you have watched season two, episode two

There’s just one small skank in the skud pie ... – Peli Motto

A song of sand and ice this week, as Din Djarin and his priceless consignment leave Tatooine and spend a few dicey hours on an icy planet.

It’s an episode that shows off the vast array of life and threats to life that exist within the galaxy. It also provides striking evidence of the thermal qualities of Beskar metal. There’s danger, too, from ugly creatures and from unshaven enforcers of the Republic alike. In the end, everyone emerges just about unscathed, though there’s another expensive trip to the garage on the horizon.

The action begins where it left off last week, with Mando and Baby Yoda en route back to Mos Eisley after killing the Krayt dragon and bagging some free barbecue. A tripwire in the sand soon catches their speeder in full glide, however, and a heist is in train. Mando deals with the first two assailants with a wrestling clothesline, but the third must be negotiated with.

The bandit wants the Baby, but Mando points out that’s not a good idea. “If you put one mark on him there is nowhere you will be able to hide from me”, is the precise phrase, and negotiations move on to the little robber man (a Jawa in breathing equipment?) getting Mando’s jet pack instead. The exchange takes place, but as we all know, jet packs are machines with a mind of their own, and within seconds of launching into the sky, the bandit drops out of it and crumples into the sand.

It’s a funny piece of choreography from this week’s director, Ant-Man’s Peyton Reed, and there’s a streak of visual comedy that runs through the entire episode – even when the massive ice spiders are about. But before all that happens, Mando must first accept another passenger, a Frog Woman who knows where the Mandalorians are hiding, but wants to deliver a cargo of precious eggs to the same location.

Off the Razor Crest goes, but problems are never far behind. Not only do two X-wing pilots show up in space, suspicious of the ship’s bonafides, but Baby Yoda has decided that the Frog Woman’s eggs are an ideal snack. With regards to the latter problem, Mando hopes that positive reinforcement of the message “do not eat the eggs” will be enough. As regards the former, a more complicated response is required, and a space chase through a neighbouring planet ensues.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Do not eat the eggs’ ... Will Mando’s message stick? Photograph: Lucasfilm

The planet is frozen, with deep ravines, emerald blue air and loads of nodules on the surface that look like the things that give birth to xenomorphs in Alien. So they’re fine, obviously. To cut a long story short, Mando and co elude the X-wings by crash-landing in a cave, which in turn collapses and damages the ship in the process. While Mando tries to fix a hole in the hull, Frog Woman wanders off for a mineral bath with her eggs. When Yoda finds out, it sets off an eggy craving, but with Frog Woman keeping them tight in a jar he has to make do with nibbling on nodules instead.

Of course, that is bad news because, the nodules contain baby ice spiders and there are also mid-size ice spiders, large ice spiders and a monstrous mummy ice spider hidden just around the corner. The action that follows is of the sort you usually get in a zombie movie, with ever more ice spiders slowly overwhelming our heroes, despite Mando’s expertise with the blaster.

You begin to wonder how a happy ending could possibly result, and a bit of Baby Yoda Force majeure seems the only option. But then there’s the sound of bleeping and the red beams of Republic blasters flash into view. The same cops who wanted to arrest Mando have now been made aware of some good behaviour during last season’s jailbreak and will help him out of this bind, provided he gets his transponder fixed (the galactic equivalent of a failed break light). The Razor Crest takes off, heading to Trask in search of repairs, and everyone breathes a big sigh of relief. All except Baby Yoda, that is, who’s got a hidden egg to scoff down while no one’s looking.

The moral of the story

Nothing is more important than family. That’s what’s driving Frog Woman to dash to a dangerous planet with a jar of eggs in tow. She wants to be reunited with her husband and to procreate (how frog IVF works, I don’t want to know). Meanwhile, mama massive ice spider gets her protective instincts provoked by the gang’s nodule noodling. Hell hath no fury like an arachnid outraged. And finally there’s the developing relationship between Din Djarin and Baby Yoda. No longer just a protector, Mando is having to teach his charge right and wrong, too, specifically in the area of Frog Egg consumption. Whether the kid is listening is another matter, but that’s the joy of parenting for you.

Featured creatures

Looking through the “amphibian” creature subset of Wookieepeedia leaves me no clearer as to quite what type of Frog Woman our Frog Woman actually is. We also meet some lovely ice spiders, and an insect creature with a jaw as long as its arm.

Cameo corner

Richard Ayoade gets to resume his voice role as Zero, the droid who was desperate to overheat the Razor Crest in his role as getaway pilot in last season’s prison heist. Here, Frog Woman shows she’s not just any old amphibian by rerouting Zero’s “vocabulator” allowing him to speak on her behalf.

Baby Yoda watch

As mentioned above, the kid is acting up. He won’t be confined to his room, he won’t sit in his chair, he certainly won’t stop eating Frog Eggs. His strong will and curiosity is increasingly a combination that’s getting Mando into trouble . But without trouble there’s no adventure, and let’s face it, the little hairy ball of snot remains irresistibly cute."
From Weezer to Missy Elliott: 10 of the best difficult second albums,['Michael Cragg'],"Dismissed at the time for being pretentious, bloated or way too WTF, these are the second albums that deserve return visits

From Weezer to Missy Elliott: 10 of the best difficult second albums

Second Coming (1994)

The Stone Roses

Released five years after the Madchester pioneers’ era-defining debut, Second Coming has become synonymous with difficult second album syndrome. Battling high expectations, crippling self-doubt and, in the end, themselves, it’s an album that mirrors its difficult gestation, with songs often hampered by superfluous noodling. The good still shines through, however, not least in the lovely Ten Storey Love Song and lead single Love Spreads.

The Menace (2000)

Elastica

Elastica’s first attempt at following up their classic 1995 debut resulted in two members leaving and the band’s temporary dissolution. The experimental and fractured The Menace eventually emerged, hastily recorded in six weeks. Disavowed by Justine Frischmann in 2013, it still offers glimpses of the band’s arch indie pop nous, specifically in Mad Dog God Dam and Generator.

Show Your Bones (2006)

Yeah Yeah Yeahs

Having seen their indie contemporaries repeat the same formula for album No 2, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were keen to reinvent themselves after 2003’s art-rock explosion Fever to Tell. It wasn’t easy – the band almost broke up during early sessions – but the results were sleeker and more melodic, paving the way for 2009’s pop breakthrough, It’s Blitz!.

The Guide: Staying In – sign up for our home entertainment tips Read more

Congratulations (2010)

MGMT

Following 2007’s Oracular Spectacular, Andrew VanWyngarden and Ben Goldwasser set about dismantling their new pop stardom. This densely packed album eschews short, sharp thrills in favour of Syd Barrett-esque experiments and opaque Eno tributes. Scuffed pop gems such as It’s Working reward the effort, however.

Pinkerton (1996)

Weezer

Riffing on Puccini’s Madama Butterfly, the gloriously emo Pinkerton – the follow-up to Weezer’s 1994 debut – wrong-footed a fanbase still singing along to their hit Buddy Holly. Saturated with the disdain frontman Rivers Cuomo felt towards his success, Pinkerton is now seen as a cult classic.

Room on Fire (2003)

The Strokes

Having unleashed a host of copycats, New York’s garage rock pinups initially wanted something different for album two. Nigel Godrich was hired as producer, before being replaced by Is This It’s Gordon Raphael. The epitome of “if it ain’t broke ...”, the album still delivers a handful of indie classics.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest On the fly … Missy Elliott works it. Photograph: IJ/AllAction/Empics Entertainment

Da Real World (1999)

Missy Elliott

The success of Elliott’s ebullient 1997 classic Supa Dupa Fly set the bar so high it left the rapper creatively paralysed. “I just kept going [to the studio] and nothing was sounding right,” she told MTV. Her producer, Timbaland, demanded that she take a break, with the re-energising holiday not lightening a darker, more paranoid, but no less inventive second album.

Surfing the Void (2010)

Klaxons

Having ridden the nu-rave wave to Mercury prize success with 2007’s Myths of the Near Future, south London haircuts Klaxons quickly crashed down to Earth in a drug-fuelled haze. Three years later, they emerged with a new psych-tinged heaviness – buffeted by Slipknot producer Ross Robinson – and, in songs such as Echoes, gloriously OTT rock operas.

Neither Fish Nor Flesh (1989)

Terence Trent D’Arby

In the late 80s, D’Arby was an undeniable superstar, his debut album, Introducing the Hardline, shifting 1.5m copies in the UK alone. While this hit-free, gloriously pretentious follow-up flopped spectacularly, there are some gorgeous moments, from the soul flex of I’ll Be Alright to the Princely strut of Attracted to You.

Paul’s Boutique (1989)

Beastie Boys

Paul’s Boutique, AKA the “Sgt Pepper of hip-hop”, was a confounding sequel to 1986’s more frat party-adjacent Licensed to Ill. Worried they’d been dismissed as a joke, the New York trio hunkered down with eccentric producers the Dust Brothers to weave together a densely packed, sample-heavy tapestry that would become their defining album."
Los Angeles: progressive challenger ousts top prosecutor Jackie Lacey,"['Sam Levin', 'Vivian Ho']","Sign up for the Guardian’s First Thing newsletter

Jackie Lacey, the Los Angeles district attorney, was ousted by her progressive challenger in one of the most closely watched criminal justice races in the US this year.

George Gascón, the former police chief and district attorney of San Francisco, won the race to lead the Los Angeles prosecutors’ office with more than 53% of the vote, as of Friday morning. Black Lives Matter LA and other activist groups played a major role in the heated contest, having protested against Lacey’s policies for years.

Omar Noureldin (@OmarHNoureldin) #JackieLaceyMustGo has been a rallying cry of scholar/activists @DocMellyMel & @NiggaTheory for years. They put in the work and didn’t let up. We have them and @BLMLA to thank for ousting Lacey. Today is a good day for Los Angeles. I hope @GeorgeGascon lives up to this moment! https://t.co/IzKHCMNEo4

A tearful Lacey conceded the race on Friday, saying that while 791,000 ballots remained to be counted in Los Angeles county, her consultants advised her that she would not be able to close the gap enough to claim victory. She suggested that unprecedented amounts of money poured into the race contributed to her defeat, as well as the nationwide protests that erupted over the summer following the high-profile police killings of Black civilians.

“The circumstances surrounding the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery gave breath to an in-progress discussion around racism, policing and criminal justice reform,” she said. “These incidents were painful and exposed an issue that existed in this country for years: racism. Our nation is going through a reckoning and what happened in my election may one day be listed as a consequence of that. It may be said that the results of this election may be the result of our season of discontent and our demand to see a tsunami of change.”

Lacey was the first woman and first African American to serve as the Los Angeles DA. In her second term, Lacey faced intensifying scrutiny over her refusal to prosecute police officers who kill, her close ties with law enforcement unions and her continued use of the death penalty.

Gascón, who was endorsed by political heavyweights such as Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders, is part of a wave of liberal, reform-minded DA candidates across the US who have pledged to undo some of the harms and racial inequities of policing and prisons.

How Black Lives Matter reshaped the race for Los Angeles’ top prosecutor Read more

BLM and other activist groups have increasingly put pressure on elected district attorneys, who are some of the most influential and least accountable players in the US criminal justice system.

Los Angeles’ prosecutorial office is the largest local prosecutor’s office in the country. The Los Angeles DA’s office oversees 1,000 lawyers, funnels defendants into the world’s largest jail system and reviews police violence cases in a county that has some of the highest number of police killings in the nation. LA prosecutors are also responsible for investigating misconduct in the LA sheriff’s department, which has been plagued by recent scandals, including controversial killings and alleged gangs of deputies engaged in criminal behavior.

Gascón gained traction and celebrity support amid national protests against police killings and racial inequality following the death of George Floyd in May. He has pledged to hold police accountable for brutality, promising to reopen specific cases of killings by police that Lacey had previously cleared.

“When I entered this race, this movement for reform and this campaign were considered by many to be a long shot in the largest county in the nation against a two-term incumbent DA,” Gascón said. “But we’re here. We did it. And I stand here before you committed to making lasting changes.”

In an interview with the Guardian last month, Gascón said he would stop using a number of “tough-on-crime” laws that have contributed to mass incarceration and California’s prison overcrowding crisis: “We can see incarceration and safety are not necessarily synonymous, and the fact that this is becoming more obvious to many, it’s very, very energizing to me.”

As DA, he said he would not fight to keep people in prison when they are up for parole, not transfer teens to adult court, won’t pursue the death penalty and won’t use “gang enhancements”, which have long been used in racially discriminatory ways.

Lacey disappointed progressive groups during her tenure, including by sending 23 people to death row, more than any other county in the US in recent years. All but one sentenced to death were people of color. Despite hundreds of killings by police, she only brought charges in one case.

Gascón also faced progressive protests when he was San Francisco DA, stemming from his refusal to prosecute police in a number of high-profile killings. Melina Abdullah, the co-founder of Black Lives Matter LA, who has long rallied against Lacey, noted that she would probably end up protesting Gascón, too, once he is DA, given the nature of the prosecutor’s office.

Jody David Armour (@NiggaTheory) Yes, we will hold @GeorgeGascon to account, as he knows that this monumental victory would not have been possible without fearless & indefatigable @BLMLA activists & their allies. Every Wednesday for 3 years in a row @DocMellyMel gathered downtown to declare #JackieLaceyMustGo! https://t.co/cimEdlhc0t

Gascón’s victory comes amid a nationwide push to elect more progressive district attorneys and reform the criminal justice system through prosecutors. Gascón himself was part of that push, as a founding member of the Prosecutors Alliance of California. “We are thrilled to see one of our founding members take on the leadership of the nation’s largest prosecutor’s office,” the organization tweeted.

“We have been thrilled at the level of local and national attention on this race, which both encouraged and reflected a heightened public awareness of both the power and discretion that a DA has,” said Molly Greene, a District Attorney Accountability Coalition steering committee member, in a statement. “Now that the race has been resolved, we intend to make sure that this awareness translates into accountability.”"
Steve Bannon banned by Twitter for calling for Fauci beheading,['Peter Beaumont'],"Twitter has banned the account of the former Donald Trump adviser and surrogate Steve Bannon after he called for the beheading of Dr Anthony Fauci and the FBI director, Christopher Wray, and the posting of their heads outside the White House as a “warning”.

Speaking on his podcast, the War Room, which was distributed in video form on a number of social media outlets, the far-right provocateur appeared to endorse violence against Wray and the US’s most senior infectious diseases expert.

“Second term kicks off with firing Wray, firing Fauci … no I actually want to go a step farther but the president is a kind-hearted man and a good man,” Bannon said.

“I’d actually like to go back to the old times of Tudor England. I’d put their heads on pikes, right, I’d put them at the two corners of the White House as a warning to federal bureaucrats, you either get with the programme or you’re gone.”

Twitter banned Bannon’s War Room account permanently, saying it had suspended the podcast account for violating its policy on the glorification of violence.

The same video was on Facebook for about 10 hours before it was also removed.

Later on Friday, William Burck, an attorney for Bannon in a fraud case in New York City, told a federal judge he was withdrawing. Bannon is accused of misappropriating money from a group which raised $2m from thousands of donors to build a wall on the border with Mexico, and has pleaded not guilty. Burck did not give a reason for his withdrawal.

There has been mounting concern over the risk of violence following this week’s US elections, amid highly inflammatory rhetoric from Trump and his allies, who have falsely said Democrats are trying to “steal the election”.

Philadelphia police arrested two men allegedly involved in a plot to attack the Pennsylvania Convention Center on Thursday night. Police were tipped off, possibly from a concerned family member of one of the men, who had driven 300 miles from Virginia.

The moves against Bannon came hours after Facebook banned “Stop the Steal”, a group involved in organising protests this weekend throughout the US against the presidential vote count.

One post, shared by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, declared: “Neither side is going to concede. Time to clean the guns, time to hit the streets.”

The increasingly heated language around the election has also included interventions from more mainstream figures, including the former Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich, who appeared to call for election workers in Pennsylvania to be arrested.

Speaking to Sean Hannity on Fox News, Gingrich amplified Trump’s false complaints of election rigging and mused about what he believed was the solution.

“My hope is that President Trump will lead the millions of Americans who understand exactly what’s going on,” Gingrich said. “The Philadelphia machine is corrupt. The Atlanta machine is corrupt. The machine in Detroit is corrupt. And they are trying to steal the presidency. And we should not allow them to do that.”

“First of all, under federal law, we should lock up the people who are breaking the law,” he continued. “You stop somebody from being an observer, you just broke federal law. Do you hide and put up papers so nobody can see what you’re doing? You just broke federal law. You bring in ballots that aren’t real? You just broke federal law.”"
Tea party-linked activists protest against 'election fraud' in US cities,['Lois Beckett'],"The same rightwing activists that helped grow the Tea party movement and spread protests against coronavirus lockdowns are now organizing demonstrations alleging fraud outside vote-counting locations in Democratic cities.

Amplifying Donald Trump’s baseless claims that Democrats are trying to steal the election, established conservative players are encouraging citizens to show up to protest in person at locations where ballots are being counted, prompting concerns about intimidation of poll workers.

FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group backed by wealthy donors that played an influential role in the Tea Party movement, touted the appearance of protesters with their preprinted FreedomWorks signs in Detroit and Philadelphia on Thursday.

The group was advertising more protests in Michigan and Pennsylvania on Friday, as well as a “solidarity” protest in Oklahoma, a solidly red state whose votes for Trump are not being contested.

This dude believes wrongly that the votes being counted inside the PA Convention Center are illegitimate and that poll observers aren’t being allowed close enough to the process.

FreedomWorks was previously linked to the largest anti-shutdown protest group in Wisconsin this spring, Vox News reported.

Stop the Steal, a Facebook group alleging election fraud by Democrats, grew by more than 350,000 members in one day. The group’s moderators and administrations included Amy Kremer, a Tea party activist who went on to co-found Women for Trump, as well as two activists linked to the“We Build the Wall” campaign, a fundraising effort that led to arrest of former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and three other men for allegedly defrauding hundreds of thousands of pro-Trump donors.

Facebook took down “Stop the Steal” on Thursday, saying that the group was “organized around the delegitimization of the election process” and that it had seen “worrying calls for violence from some members of the group”.

Stand Up Michigan, a more recent group that had a series of “freedom rallies” in Michigan opposing coronavirus restrictions, was also removed by Facebook after posts encouraging followers to show up at a ballot-counting location in Detroit on Wednesday to serve as ballot challengers.

Early protests by Trump supporters at election centers in Michigan and Arizona were small but volatile on Wednesday, with protesters in Detroit chanting, and a condemnation from Michigan’s secretary of state, who suggested that the protesters were a distraction and that they were attempting to intimidate election workers and keep them from doing their jobs.

By Thursday evening, protests around the country had grown more volatile, with far-right Proud Boys showing up to a “Stop the Biden Steal” rally in Miami, and armed protesters showing up to demonstrations by election facilities in Arizona and Nevada, according to local reporters.

In Miami, at one of four “Stop the Biden Steal” events being held simultaneously in the state, about 150 Trump supporters lined up in a car park by a roadside restaurant. Organizers placed a large speaker on the back of a truck, nestled by a yellow sign that read: “Stop Fraud.” Attendees listened, almost silently, as Trump espoused baseless claims in an attempt to undermine the outcome of the election.

Shortly after the speech Enrique Tarrio, chairman of the Proud Boys and state director of Latinos for Trump, addressed the crowd, pushing more baseless conspiracies about the election. The Proud Boys are an extremist organization with links to white supremacy.

“I want to ask you guys to stay in these streets,” he told the crowd after informing them he was traveling to Michigan on Friday, a state that has been a hotbed of militia activity in recent months.

In Philadelphia two men were being held outside the convention center where the vote count in the city is taking place after Philadelphia police were notified of the threat of an attack, CBS Philly reporrted.

Rapper King Von shot dead outside Atlanta nightclub,['Victoria Bekiempis'],"The rapper King Von died early on Friday following a shooting outside an Atlanta, Georgia, nightclub in which police became involved, authorities said.

The Atlanta police department said that it did not believe the rapper, whose legal name is Dayvon Daquan Bennett, was shot by police but rather in a shootout preceding police involvement.

“At this time, our investigators believe Mr Bennett was shot during the initial shootout between the two groups of males, prior to police responding and attempting to stop the shooting,” authorities said in a statement.

According to police, two groups of males outside the Monaco Hookah Lounge began arguing with each other at around 3.20am. Two off-duty police officers, who were working an “extra job” at Monaco, were outside the lounge. “The officers were in uniform and a marked [Atlanta police department] vehicle with its blue lights activated for visibility was parked nearby,” authorities said.

The dispute “quickly escalated to gunfire between these two groups”, police said.

One of the two off-duty officers, as well as an on-duty officer who was working near the lounge, “confronted” the alleged shooters. Police said “shots were fired during the encounter”.

Bennett was taken to the hospital in a private vehicle, police said. A total of three people, including Bennett, are said to have died.

Bennett, 26, is from Chicago and was on track to have a watershed year. His first mixtape, Grandson, Vol 1, was released in September 2019, according to Pitchfork. In March, Bennett released his second mixtape, Levon James, which reached No 81 on Rolling Stone’s Top 200 Albums chart, the magazine reported. Bennett has amassed about 575m streams, the magazine said.

Artists including Chance The Rapper expressed grief over Bennett’s death.

“Wow. This year was so tough. rip von God bless him and his family I can’t believe it,” he tweeted on Friday afternoon.

The Georgia bureau of investigation (GBI) has been asked to investigate the officers’ involvement in this incident.

Six men were shot during the initial altercation and subsequent officer involvement. The three men who did not die from gunshot wounds have been hospitalized, the GBI said. The officers were not hurt.

“The GBI will continue its independent investigation,” the bureau said in a statement. “Once the investigation is complete, it will be submitted to the Fulton county district attorney’s office for review.”

Atlanta police are also scrutinizing the deaths. “Part of the investigations will include determining which individuals were struck by gunfire from the suspects and whether any were struck by gunfire from the officers,” police said.

Attempts to reach Bennett’s representatives were not immediately successful.

Ghazi Shami, who reportedly founded Bennett’s record label, wrote on Instagram: “My heart is heavy. Another young rising star gone too soon. I pray for your family lil bro.”

He added: “We have to find a better way. There is too much senseless violence. This has to stop. God help us. #RipKingVon.”"
From gig economy to election rules: other measures the US voted on,[],"Away from the presidential and congressional races, at least 124 statutory and constitutional questions were put to voters in 32 US states and the District of Columbia, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL).

The pandemic dampened grassroots enthusiasm for circulating petitions to get measures on the ballot, as citizen-led initiatives this year dropped to 38, from 60 in 2018 and 72 in 2016, the NCSL said. But the 2020 crop of ballot measures still covered a wide array of issues, from election laws to abortion rights to worker rights and taxes. Here are some of key results:

Marijuana

Voters in New Jersey, Arizona, South Dakota and Montana approved measures to legalise marijuana for recreational use, and South Dakota and Mississippi approved the drug’s use for medical purposes. Since 1996, 33 other states and the District of Columbia have allowed medical marijuana, 11 had previously approved its recreational use and 16, including some medical marijuana states, have decriminalised simple possession, according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.

Psilocybin (magic mushrooms)

Psilocybin, a hallucinogen also known in its raw form as magic mushrooms, was approved by Oregon voters for therapeutic use for adults. Backers of the Psilocybin Services Act cited research showing benefits of the drug as a treatment for anxiety disorders and other mental health conditions. The approved measure sets a two-year schedule to review the matter and create a regulatory structure for its sale.

In a related measure, Washington DC voters approved Initiative 81, which directs police to rank “entheogenic plants and fungi,” including psilocybin and mescaline, among its lowest enforcement priorities.

Minimum wage

Voters in Florida approved a measure to amend the state constitution to gradually increase its $8.56 per hour minimum wage to $15 by 30 September 2026.

California gig workers

California voters approved a measure that would exempt ride-share and delivery drivers from a state law that makes them employees, not contractors. The measure, Proposition 22, is the first gig-economy question to go before statewide voters in a campaign. Backers including Uber and Lyft spent more than $190m on their campaign, making it the costliest ballot measure ever, according to the NCSL.

Abortion

Colorado voters rejected a measure to ban abortions, except those needed to save the life of the mother, after 22 weeks of pregnancy. In Louisiana, voters approved an amendment that makes clear that the state constitution does not protect abortion rights or funding for abortions. The amendment clears the way for the state to outlaw abortion if the US supreme court overturns the landmark Roe v Wade decision that protects abortion rights under the US constitution.

Elections

Ranked-choice voting, which lets voters select state and federal candidates in order of preference, was rejected by Massachusetts voters. Only Maine lets its voters use the method statewide. A citizen-initiated measure on the issue was also on the ballot in Alaska, but results there were incomplete. California approved a measure to restore the right to vote to parolees convicted of felonies.

Taxes

In California, a proposal to roll back a portion of the state’s landmark Proposition 13 law limiting property taxes was too close to call on Wednesday. The measure, Proposition 15 on the state’s 2020 ballot, would leave in place protections for residential properties but raise taxes on commercial properties worth more than $3m."
US midwest storms in August were costliest in country’s history,['David Hambling'],"The thunderstorm that swept through the American midwest in August is now officially the most expensive in US history, inflicting more than $7.5bn of damage in 14 hours, according to figures released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The underlying cause of the destruction was a derecho, a weather phenomenon that typically produces a row of storms spanning at least 100 miles.

Unlike cyclones and hurricanes, which rotate, a derecho blows in a straight line. The August derecho blasted almost 800 miles across parts of Nebraska, South Dakota, and Iowa.

Many homes were destroyed, especially in the town of Cedar Rapids, in which 90% of the buildings were damaged. Half a million people were without electricity in the immediate aftermath.

In financial terms, the worst damage was to millions of hectares of growing corn and soybeans. Such powerful hail accompanied the wind in many places that a local climatologist compared it to machine-gun fire. The storm struck just as the crops were approaching maturity and the heavily laden plants were flattened. More than 300,000 hectares of harvest were lost.

Destructive as it was, the midwest derecho was not the most expensive weather event in the US this year. Hurricane Laura, which struck Louisiana in August, caused about $14bn in damage."
'We're seeing more than ever': white shark populations rise off California coast,['Katharine Gammon'],"Chris Lowe is no longer surprised when he sees drone footage of juvenile white sharks cruising near surfers and swimmers in southern California’s ocean waters.

Lowe directs the shark lab at California State University, Long Beach, and for the past 12 years he’s been monitoring populations of juvenile white sharks off the southern California coast with tags, drones and planes. This year, Lowe has already tagged a record 38 sharks, triple the number that were tagged last year. “Normally they’d be leaving by now, but instead we are seeing more sharks than ever.”

Two years ago, Lowe was asked by the state to investigate in more detail what sharks are doing along the beaches and how they behave in proximity to people – research that officials hope will help predict where and when the sharks show up and will help educate the public about the animals.

White sharks have been affected by humans for more than a century. Commercial fisheries caught them for years (many a fish taco was probably shark, Lowe said) and sharks’ primary adult food – marine mammals – has been hunted to the brink of extinction.

California moved to protect its white shark population in 1994, and has seen its numbers rise steadily since. In southern California, most sharks spotted near beaches are juveniles.

White sharks are born at 4.5 to 5ft long, and grow a foot each year for their first five years of life. They love southern California’s shallows because the water is warmer (young sharks lack the ability to retain heat in colder waters), safer from predators and full of their preferred food: stingrays. When they reach 10ft, they switch food sources to marine mammals like seals, and they spend more time away from the shoreline.

Lowe studies the animals from the land, in the water and from the skies.

He works closely with lifeguards, who are on the frontlines during the summer and fall beach season. His team also goes out to tag sharks, when they try to surgically implant the animals’ back with a finger-sized acoustic transmitter that connects with listening stations all along the coastline.

The acoustic stations display where the sharks are spending their time, and they allow the research team to track individual sharks for years – even when they cross the southern border with Mexico to Baja California. Some of the transmitters will last for a decade. “It’s a little like how you get a bill at the end of the month for a toll road,” said Lowe. “We use the same technology – the only difference is we get the bill, they don’t.”

In addition to tagging and tracking, the team also uses an autonomous underwater robot that can rise up and down and looks like a torpedo. It carries a full set of oceanographic sensors on its nose and a video camera. The robot allows the researchers to make high-resolution three-dimensional maps, and study why sharks are hanging out where they are: is it because there are more stingrays, warmer water, or fewer people?

Aerial drones are the team’s final piece of tech – the researchers fly drone surveys from the San Diego border with Mexico to Santa Barbara, to identify sharks’ location and size, and to see when they are close to people. “We can go through and count how many people are in the water, surfers, fishers, paddle boarders, and plot the distance to any shark,” Lowe said.

Lowe has found that not only are there more kid-sharks in the waters, they’re around longer, too. Juvenile white sharks typically leave California waters for Baja California in the fall, and return in the spring, but that pattern has been changing – probably due to warmer waters and an abundance of food. “We may have white sharks here year-round,” he said.

Up in Monterey Bay in northern California, David Ebert, who directs the Pacific Shark Research Center at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, has seen a similar rise in numbers of juvenile white sharks off the coast.

Ebert recalled taking a helicopter ride in 2015 over the Monterey Bay and being astounded by what he saw from the sky: little sharks hanging out in small groups, right off the beach.

On one hand, the growing presence of the juveniles is a good sign, he said, because it shows the ecosystem is clean and there is enough food to support the sharks. But it also points to how the climate crisis, and warmer ocean temperatures, can shift the range of the animals. Southern California used to be at the northern limit of their range, and now it might be in the middle, Ebert said.

Even with more sharks in the water, Ebert said humans have little to fear from the juveniles. Since 1950, when the state started keeping records, there have been on average only three or four attacks a year in California, Ebert says – even as the state population has swelled from 15 million to 40 million. “There are so many people in the water: you have paddle boards, kayaks, wetsuits, but the number of attacks hasn’t really changed. That tells you that people are not on the menu, they’re not out here hunting people.”

“They’re an amazing animal to see in person,” he added. “I think it’s one of those rare wildlife experiences, you can spend your whole life out there on the water and never see one.”

Lowe, too, said that generally when he sees sharks swimming around people, the people have no idea – and the sharks generally don’t care.

He and his team now hope to create a shark forecast – “it’s going to be a sharky week!” – that can help educate beachgoers about the sharks in California’s waters. Lowe said he could see a future where lifeguards can post signs about where the juveniles are hanging out, alongside information about the tides and waves. He says that if you happen to see a group of sharks on the beach, it’s actually a cause for celebration: “They are keeping the stingray population down, and they generally don’t care about people.”"
What’s in a name? How the legacy of slavery endures in Tunisia,['Simon Speakman Cordall'],"Black people in the north African country suffer hardship and disadvantage, and many still carry the label of ‘liberated’ slaves

Many within Tunisia greeted the news that 81-year-old Hamden Dali had won his two decade-long campaign to have “atig” removed from his name with little more than bemusement.

But for Dali atig – meaning “liberated by” – in his name was a painful reminder of his family’s heritage as former slaves.

Dali, who lives on the island of Djerba, does not have a telephone. However, his lawyer, Hanen Ben Hassana, from the mainland city of Sfax, was clear: “You have to think of what could possibly make an 80-year-old man insist on pursuing his case despite all the hardships, including the spread of the virus,” she says. “Just think of that. Then you’ll realise the kind of history he’s been carrying on his back for a great part of his life.”

Man can drop part of name denoting slave ancestry, Tunisian court rules Read more

Tunisia was the first Arab country to abolish slavery, outlawing the practice in 1846, 19 years before the US. However, though the initial edict was quickly adopted in the urban north, it was some time before slavery was abolished entirely, with a further proclamation required in 1890.

Today, between 10 and 15% of Tunisians are black, many descended from slaves. What few can dispute is the relative lack of black Tunisians in politics or the media. According to a 2018 Afrobarometer survey, black Tunisians reported a variety of disadvantages, the most important of which was unemployment, at about 42%, compared with 25% nationally.

It’s harder for black people to get professional jobs, not because of any law, but because we grow up under different conditions Saadia Mosbah, activist

The exact number of slaves within Tunisia, of both African and European origin, was estimated in the 1960s as having been as low as 7,000 in 1861 while more recent accounts put the figure closer to 167,000.

Though the practice may have been abolished for more than a century, its legacy lives on. In the ancient medina in Tunis, the old slave market still stands, although today its stalls sell gold and silver rather than human beings.

In Tunisia’s south, the village of El Gosbah stands divided by a river, separating the settlements of the descendants of black slaves from their white neighbours. In language, slavery’s legacy thrives, with surnames such as Abid and Shoushan, both denoting slave, commonplace.

In Bardo, a suburb of Tunis, Saadia Mosbah relaxes in the makeshift headquarters of her anti-racism association, Mnemty (my dream).

“Everyone speaks of the transatlantic slave routes, but no one really speaks of the trans-Saharan slave routes from areas around Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Gambia,” she says. “Why haven’t we spoken of these? Principally because it was Arabs and Muslims who enslaved, which makes people reluctant to talk about them.”

For Mosbah, a lack of education coupled with an unwillingness to address their complicity in the slave trade, are among the drivers of racism. “Tunisians don’t really know this. It isn’t taught in schools. It isn’t in the history books. It’s a case of amnesia,” she says. “If more people knew about it, it might limit the racism and lessen the pain people feel. For example, once someone knows the history of the blacks and the slaves, they’ll understand that they were brought here to be part of the workforce, until machinery eventually forced them out.”

In 2018, Tunisia passed a landmark law, essentially criminalising racial discrimination, which was pivotal in Hamden Dali shedding his unwanted label. But a lack of funds – a perennial issue in Tunisian politics – has limited any campaign to raise awareness of the law, leaving that task to groups such as Mnemty.

However, the law is up against decades of disadvantage. “It’s harder for black people to get professional jobs,” Mosbah says. “Not because of any law, but because we grow up under different conditions.”

While slavery’s poisonous legacy continues to be debated around the world, there is at least some evidence that Tunisian authorities are keen to address the past. But the prejudice that underpinned it remains an everyday part of life for black Tunisians and those who travel to the country from across Africa to study.

Helping out in the Mnemty offices is 23-year-old Bilel (not his real name). Bilel came to Tunisia from Ivory Coast to study engineering, but has been racially harassed, both officially and socially, since his arrival.

Johnny Depp says he has been asked to resign from Fantastic Beasts franchise,['Benjamin Lee'],"Actor has announced he will be exiting the Harry Potter prequel series after losing his libel case over allegations of assault towards ex-wife Amber Heard

Johnny Depp is set to exit the Fantastic Beasts franchise after being asked to resign by Warner Bros.

The actor announced the decision in a statement on Instagram, one that comes just days after he lost his libel case against the Sun over claims he abused his ex-wife Amber Heard.

“I wish to let you know that I have been asked to resign by Warner Bros from my role as Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts and I have respected and agreed to that request,” Depp wrote.

He then followed the news with an insistence of his innocence and a promise to continue his legal battle to prove it. “The surreal judgment of the court in the UK will not change my fight to tell the truth and I confirm that I plan to appeal,” he wrote. “My resolve remains strong and I intend to prove that the allegations against me are false. My life and career will not be defined by this moment in time.”

The news was also confirmed by Warner Bros in a statement which details that his role of the villainous Grindelwald will be recast.

Earlier this week, Depp lost his libel case against the Sun after he was called a “wife-beater” following stories of alleged abuse against Heard. “I have found that the great majority of alleged assaults of Ms Heard by Mr Depp have been proved to the civil standard,” the judge said.

Principal photography on the untitled third Fantastic Beasts movie was set to begin in March but was postponed after the start of the pandemic. It commenced in September with safety precautions and is unclear whether Depp filmed any scenes alongside stars Jude Law and Eddie Redmayne.

The second film, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, was seen as a major box office disappointment in 2018 after making $564m worldwide, the lowest total of any film within the Harry Potter universe. Depp’s reprise of his role in the sequel led to a backlash at the time but was defended by author JK Rowling. “Based on our understanding of the circumstances, the film-makers and I are not only comfortable sticking with our original casting, but genuinely happy to have Johnny playing a major character in the movies,” Rowling said.

The actor’s most recent performance, as war photographer W Eugene Smith in drama Minamata, premiered this year at the Berlin film festival to middling reviews. Depp had also been rumoured to return to the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise in Margot Robbie’s upcoming reboot yet he currently has no future acting credits confirmed.

US removes shadowy group from terror list blamed by China for attacks,[],"The United States has removed from its list of terror groups a shadowy faction regularly blamed by China to justify its harsh crackdown in the Muslim-majority Xinjiang region.

In a notice in the Federal Register, which publishes new US laws and rules, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said on Friday he was revoking the designation of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) as a “terrorist organization.”

“ETIM was removed from the list because, for more than a decade, there has been no credible evidence that ETIM continues to exist,” a state department spokesperson said.

The administration of George W Bush in 2004 added ETIM, also sometimes called the Turkestan Islamic Party, to a blacklist as it found common cause with China in the US-led “war on terror”.

Beijing has regularly blamed ETIM for attacks as it justifies its measures in Xinjiang, where rights groups say that 1 million or more Uighurs or other Turkic-speaking, mostly Muslim people are incarcerated in camps.

But scholars say that China has produced little evidence that ETIM is an organised group or that it is to blame for attacks in Xinjiang, which separatists call East Turkestan.

The Washington-based Uighur Human Rights Project called the decision “long overdue” and a “definitive rejection of China’s claims”.

“The harmful effects of China’s exploitation of the imagined ETIM threat are real – 20 years of state terror directed at Uighurs,” said the group’s executive director, Omer Kanat.

China has acknowledged camps in Xinjiang but describes them as vocational centres meant to reduce the allure of Islamic radicalism.

While experts have doubted a role of ETIM, China has suffered a series of attacks that authorities blamed on Uighur separatists.

In 2014, assailants stabbed to death 31 passengers at a railway station in the south-western city of Kunming.

In 2009, hundreds died in Xinjiang’s capital Urumqi in riots that largely targeted China’s majority Han.

Activists say that China is trying to forcibly integrate Uighurs by indoctrinating them with communist ideology and making them renounce Islamic customs.

Pompeo has previously called the mass incarceration “the stain of the century” and US senators across party lines are seeking to declare China’s treatment of the Uighurs genocide.

ETIM was listed on the US terrorist exclusion list, which affects entry of people into the country, but was never hit with the tougher designation of foreign terrorist organization."
Historian finds clues to grave of Britain’s first black army officer,[],"A historian believes he may have uncovered clues about where Britain’s first black army officer was laid to rest.

Walter Tull served in the first world war as a second lieutenant, leading men into battle at a time when the army forbade a person of non-European descent becoming an officer.

As well as being one of the most celebrated black British soldiers of the war, Tull was also one of the first black professional football players in England, playing for Tottenham Hotspur and later Northampton Town while overcoming racial discrimination.

He died aged 29 while leading an attack during the second Battle of the Somme on the Western Front on 25 March 1918.

Historic accounts of the event describe how Tull’s friend Pte Thomas Billingham, a fellow footballer and goalkeeper for Leicester Fosse, saw him killed and tried to retrieve his body so he could have a proper burial.

Despite the best efforts of his men, Tull’s body was never recovered and his family believed he lay somewhere in a field in the Somme.

However, research by the military historian Andy Robertshaw points to unmarked graves at Heninel-Croisilles Road cemetery in northern France where Tull may have been buried.

Tull’s grandnephew Edward Finlayson, from Edinburgh, said it was possible he had been buried, among others, by the Germans when the ground was lost to enemy forces.

“Andy’s research and his knowledge of events of that day is extraordinary for us as a family,” he said.

“What’s striking to me is how Andy’s research is able to reconstruct what happened that day. To me it’s remarkable and very interesting.

“What we know from newspaper accounts is Tom Billingham, in Walter’s group of men, tried to carry his body but because of the intensity of the onslaught he couldn’t.

“This German offence we know was hugely intense.”

Finlayson said the family could not be absolutely certain that his body is buried at the site as the graves cannot be dug up, but added: “Up until this recent information we had no reason to believe his body was identified or buried.”

Tull is remembered on the memorial wall in the Faubourg d’Amiens cemetery in Arras, along with 35,000 soldiers whose bodies were never recovered from the battlefields.

There is also a statue commemorating him in Northampton.

In his research, Robertshaw, who has worked with as a military adviser on films including Sam Mendes’s 1917 and Steven Spielberg’s War Horse, cross-referenced the War Graves Commission’s work and the regimental war diaries.

His findings are highlighted in the podcast Amazing War Stories with Bruce Crompton."

The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has removed the governor of the country’s central bank from his post after the lira currency hit record lows, having lost 30% of its value since the start of the year.

The decision to replace Murat Uysal as governor was made by presidential decree and announced in the country’s official gazette early on Saturday. It was not immediately clear why Uysal was removed.

The lira closed at 8.544 against the US dollar on Friday after a touching record low of 8.58, despite dollar weakness as votes were still being counted in the US election.

Erdoğan had appointed then-deputy governor Uysal to head the central bank in July 2019 when he sacked his predecessor, Murat Çetinkaya, amid the president’s frustration that the bank had not cut interest rates to boost the economy.

Erdoğan, a self-described enemy of high interest rates, has repeatedly called for lower borrowing costs. Last weekend, he said Turkey was fighting an economic war against those squeezing it in “the devil’s triangle of interest and exchange rates and inflation”.

However, Turkey was at risk of a full-blown currency crisis such as the one it suffered in 2018 unless the central bank adopted tighter monetary policy, Capital Economics warned this week.

Prof. Steve Hanke (@steve_hanke) #BREAKING: The war-of-words between #French President @EmmanuelMacron and @RTErdogan continues, and so does the #TurkIsh lira’s troubles. The #lira is toast. Headed for 9 to the USD. This will keep fueling #inflation. Today, I measure it at 48.49%/yr. pic.twitter.com/QbpKZ2JD9H

“Foreign currency reserves are precariously low and falling,” Capital said. “Turkey’s gross external financing needs are still very large as a result of the banking sector’s huge short-term external debts.

“We are becoming increasingly concerned that Turkey’s central bank will not deliver the monetary tightening required to shore up investor confidence.”

Naci Ağbal, an Erdoğan ally who served as finance minister from 2015 until 2018, will be the new governor but it was not clear if he would be prepared to raise rates.

Turkey’s Milliyet newspaper reported on Thursday that finance minister Berat Albayrak had ruled out intervening to support the lira, reiterating government concerns that raising interest rates could hurt the economy.

At the last meeting of its monetary policy committee on 22 October, the central bank bucked expectations for a big interest rate hike and held its policy rate steady at 10.25%, triggering sharp losses in the lira.

The bank, which also surprised markets a month earlier when it hiked rates, said it would continue with liquidity measures to tighten money supply. It raised the uppermost rate in its corridor, the late liquidity window, to 14.75% from 13.25%.

However, the lira has continued to slide despite those measures, weakening 30% against the US currency this year to become the worst performer in emerging markets.

Bearishness towards the lira stems from concerns about possible Western sanctions against Turkey, depleted reserves, high inflation and political interference in monetary policy.

Analysts are concerned that Turkey’s ties could suffer if Democrat Joe Biden becomes US president."
More than 40 fleeing Mozambique violence feared dead after boat sinks,['Kate Hodal'],"More than 40 people fleeing violence in Mozambique’s conflict-torn north are believed to have drowned after the boat carrying them to safety sank, according to reports.

At least 70 people were on board the vessel when it sank on 29 October in the Indian Ocean just north of the provincial capital of Pemba, where tens of thousands of people have sought refuge from a three-year Islamist insurgency, the UN International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Reuters reported.

Nearly 400,000 people have been displaced from their homes in Cabo Delgado province, one of the country’s poorest regions, despite being home to gas projects valued at $60bn (£45bn).

Survivor Uyeca Mpate said she, her husband of four months and many others had fled their homes in Palma, where Total and Exxon are leading projects to liquefy gas from offshore fields, to try to build a new life further south in Pemba.

“When the boat sank, I was able to hold on to a jerrycan [water container] that I had and made it to the nearest island,” she told IOM.

“Other people held on to cushions from the boat, and some held a cord, but the others drowned. My husband also drowned. The greatest number of deaths were children. Only two children survived,” she said.

Issa Tarmamade, district administrator of Ibo, said 32 people were rescued by a passing boat, while the others were feared dead. Some bodies had already been found, including the body of a child recovered on Ibo island five days after the vessel sank.

“We are combing the area … [and] we expect to find more dead bodies on the shores of those islands,” he told Reuters. The small boat may have been overloaded with people and their belongings, he added.

The growing Islamist insurgency in northern Mozambique, which encompasses various groups including al-Shabaab, has carried out more than 660 attacks since 2017, according to Acled, which collects and maps data on global armed conflict. Attacks have intensified this year, with insurgents burning down homes, kidnapping children and decapitating villagers. The government has struggled to contain the conflict, and insurgents are now in control of a strategic port close to Mozambique’s natural gas fields.

In the past three weeks, more than 13,000 people have fled Cabo Delgado on more than 270 boats destined for Pemba, according to the IOM.

More than 2,000 people have been killed since the conflict began and approximately 710,000 people – including displaced people and their host communities – are now facing severe hunger as a result of this crisis, according to the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs."
Dutch government pilots technology to cut e-bike road deaths,['Daniel Boffey'],"Electric bike motors will be shut down when entering residential or built-up areas of Amsterdam, under a government-funded project to cut road deaths from the increasingly powerful vehicles.

The digital technology, which has been successfully trialled on a 4km stretch of bike lanes at Schiphol airport, was funded by the Dutch ministry of infrastructure and water management.

The not-for-profit Townmaking Institute behind the concept is working with e-bike manufacturers and government authorities with the expectation that the speed-cutting technology and new regulations could be rolled out by 2022.

Sixty-five people died last year while riding e-bikes, which have an integrated electric motor to propel the wheels, up from 57 in 2018. The vast majority were men over the age of 65. The standard e-bike reaches speeds of 12mph (20km/h), but faster models, such as speed pedelecs, can reach 28mph.

Indranil Bhattacharya, a technology strategist at the Townmaking Institute, said discussions had been opened with manufacturers about how their bikes would interact with digital infrastructure built by local authorities.

He said: “When we first discussed the idea with manufacturers that you would cut off the power they said: ‘Well, we will put the intelligence in our own bikes, we don’t need the infrastructure telling us.’

“But I think we helped them to understand that where vehicles should go and how fast is not up to a private party, a business. In a functioning democracy, that is the job of citizens and of government.”

Discussions over the use of the technology are most advanced with the municipality of Amsterdam, but the provinces of Gelderland and North Holland are also said to have shown an interest.

“The whole narrative is about moving individuals from a self-centric mode,” Bhattacharya said. “You have been cycling through an empty stretch and you are mostly thinking of yourself and your experience, but now as you come into a built-up area it is about the collective good. By reducing the speed we are making it safer for everybody.”

The technology trialled at Schiphol offers policymakers a range of options. “Say the weather is really bad, there is a headwind of 40km and cyclists are at a standstill, then cutting off the power would be counterintuitive,” said Bhattacharya.

“We built it so you can detect the direction the bike is going, and a policymaker can say: ‘We change the regulation. We won’t cut your power off because the weather is bad.’ The intelligent infrastructure would then tell the bicycle not to cut off the power.”

The infrastructure could also inform an e-bike of upcoming obstacles or junctions, by alerting cyclists with a gentle vibration of the handlebars.

Bhattacharya said: “It’s a bit like turning your mobile phone on. As you arrive, the [bike’s software] makes a session with the digital infrastructure. A digital twin will be aware of a bump coming up and send an alert. It will talk directly to the bicycle.”

The Dutch ministry of infrastructure and water has provided €1.3m (£1.2m) of funding for the project, a sum matched by Schiphol, which wants to encourage its employees to cycle to work."
As Time Goes By actor Geoffrey Palmer dies aged 93,['Hannah J Davies'],"Geoffrey Palmer, the actor best known for roles in sitcoms including The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, As Time Goes By and Butterflies has died aged 93.



Palmer began his TV career with roles in shows including The Avengers and ITV’s The Army Game, and Ken Loach’s TV play Cathy Come Home. Following stage roles in productions including Laurence Olivier’s imagining of JB Priestley’s Eden End, Palmer returned primarily to television, where he would find acclaim in The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin and Butterflies, gaining a reputation for portraying world-weary characters.

Between 1992 and 2005, Palmer and Judi Dench starred in the sitcom As Time Goes By, playing former lovers Lionel and Jean, who reconnected later in life.

Other TV roles included Fawlty Towers and Doctor Who. Palmer also appeared alongside Dench in the Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies in 1997, and John Madden’s Mrs Brown, also released in 1997. On film, he also appeared in A Fish Called Wanda, Clockwise and The Madness of King George. He also lent his distinctive voice to a number audiobooks, adverts and podcasts, and the narration of BBC series Grumpy Old Men.

Born in London, Palmer served in the Royal Marines between 1946 and 1948, prior to his acting career.

He largely stayed out of the public eye, though he did campaign against the HS2 railway plan in 2013 which he said would destroy the countryside around his home in the Chilterns in Buckinghamshire, describing it as a “vanity project” in an interview with the BBC.

Leading the tributes online, director Edgar Wright said: The flight path gag wiping out the lines of Reggie Perrin’s brother in law is one of my favourite in comedy. RIP to the brilliantly funny Geoffrey Palmer”.

He is survived by his wife Sally and children Charles and Harriet."
Johnson and EU commission chief to hold talks before decisive week for Brexit deal,"['Daniel Boffey', 'William Keegan']","Phonecall with Ursula von der Leyen could be final chance for PM to avert no-deal Brexit

Boris Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will hold talks on Saturday before a potentially decisive week in the Brexit negotiations, amid growing concern in Brussels at the lack of progress.

UK sources played down expectations of a breakthrough moment but with time short for parliamentary ratification the phonecall may prove to be the final chance for a political intervention in the troubled talks.

“The prime minister will speak to [Von der Leyen] tomorrow afternoon to take stock of the UK-EU negotiations,” a Downing Street spokesman said.

Johnson said he hoped a trade deal with the EU could be agreed, but the UK was well prepared if final-stage talks failed. “I very much hope that we will [get a deal], and obviously that depends on our friends and partners across the Channel. I think there is a deal to be done if they want to do it. If not, the country is of course very, very well prepared and as I have said before, we can do very, very well on Australian terms.”

Claims that Joe Biden’s expected victory in the US presidential election had provoked the meeting were dismissed by EU and British sources as “far fetched”.

Sources said the call was scheduled before election night and that uncertainty over the potential for a trade deal with the new US administration was having little or no impact on the talks.

The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, returns to London for the trade and security negotiations on Sunday.

EU diplomats representing the 27 member states were told by the European commission on Friday that the next “major moment” would come at the end of next week, on Barnier’s return.

The outstanding issues remain the level of access to UK waters provided to EU fishing fleets, fair competition rules for business – including rules on domestic subsidies – and the mechanism in the final treaty for resolving future disputes.

EU officials close to the negotiations bemoaned a particular absence of progress on the so-called level playing field provisions to ensure neither side can deregulate to gain an advantage or unfairly subsidise businesses.

There remains a lack of accord on how prohibitive the rules on domestic subsidies should be in the future treaty.

Barnier told EU diplomats this week that the two sides were also struggling to agree a “credible mechanism” to ensure that social, environmental and labour standards on both sides develop in parallel. “We are nowhere,” said one source.

The UK has agreed to non-regression from the current level but is resisting provisions that would tie the UK to Brussels’ rulebook in perpetuity. “Ideology is difficult to overcome,” said a source.

EU sources said they hoped that the UK government’s refusal to budge was “brinkmanship” and “posturing” but they feared the two sides were doomed to run out of time, with neither willing to budge.

David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, has been pushing for a “final arbitration” meeting between Johnson and Von der Leyen, to Barnier’s frustration.

Barnier told diplomats this week the gap between the two sides remained too wide on too many issues for such a moment to deliver a solution. He told MEPs in a meeting on Wednesday that “next week is really the last chance for the British to move”.

One EU official said Johnson had not shown “any grasp of the detail”.

Should a deal be possible, it is hoped the 27 EU leaders will be able to sign it off at an upcoming conference call on 19 November or at a similar summit expected to be arranged soon after. Sources suggested agreement needed to be found by 12 or 13 November to allow the European parliament to start its ratification process."
UN urges resumption of mass measles and polio vaccinations,['Sarah Boseley'],"Unicef and the World Health Organization have called for urgent action to prevent millions of avoidable child deaths from measles and polio by resuming mass vaccinations disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic.

They say that while there is no vaccine against the coronavirus yet, there are very effective immunisations against these two killer diseases, and children should not be left at risk. Measles vaccination prevented 23.2 million deaths between 2000 and 2018, they say, and polio was on the brink of eradication before the pandemic hit, with more than 18 million people walking around who would have been paralysed without a vaccination.

Measles stalks Central African Republic in Covid’s shadow – in pictures Read more

The two UN organisations estimate that $655m (£500m) is urgently needed to fill the gaps opening up in vaccination services against the two diseases.

“We cannot allow the fight against one deadly disease to cause us to lose ground in the fight against other diseases,” said Unicef’s executive director, Henrietta Fore. “Addressing the global Covid-19 pandemic is critical. However, other deadly diseases also threaten the lives of millions of children in some of the poorest areas of the world.”

The two organisations are calling for global action from country leaders, donors and partners. “We need additional financial resources to safely resume vaccination campaigns and prioritise immunisation systems that are critical to protect children and avert other epidemics besides Covid-19,” Fore said.

“Covid-19 has had a devastating effect on health services and in particular immunisation services, worldwide,” said WHO’s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “But unlike with Covid, we have the tools and knowledge to stop diseases such as polio and measles. What we need are the resources and commitments to put these tools and knowledge into action. If we do that, children’s lives will be saved.”

The women who risk their lives to deliver Pakistan's polio vaccines Read more

Measles outbreaks had become a problem before Covid hit, partly because of families’ caution about vaccines in various parts of the world. In parts of Europe and north America, unfounded but sometimes sincerely-felt doubts about the safety of the measles vaccine have spread via social media. In other regions, there have been problems with supplies and a lack of confidence in the government.

Unicef says the number of new measles infections climbed to its highest in more than two decades in 2019, and data to be released next week is expected to show high death tolls in many countries.

Poliovirus transmission is expected to increase in Pakistan and Afghanistan and in many areas of Africa where insufficient numbers of children have been immunised.

The Covid-19 pandemic has undermined routine vaccination services. “Even when available, people are unable to access services because of lockdown and transport disruptions, or are unwilling due to fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2. This has resulted in plummeting uptake of vaccination in many countries, falling to as low as 50% in some countries during the crisis,” says a report from the two UN agencies.

Polio and measles vaccination campaigns were paused while measures were put in place to protect health workers and communities from coronavirus infection. “The result of the pause is that more than 94 million children have missed out on measles vaccination alone,” the report said.

Countries are resuming their vaccinations, but WHO and Unicef say it is vital that they make immunisation a budget priority and respond quickly to outbreaks of the diseases.

They estimate that investment of $400m is needed for polio and $255m for measles."
A meal in a bowl: winter soups to warm body and soul – recipes,['Stosie Madi'],"A lemony lentil and chard soup from the Levant, a lazy bowl of ham hock and squash, a game bird and barley broth, and a fish soup that’s as adaptable as it is tasty

There’s nothing better than a bowl of hot, nourishing soup on a cold day. These robust, mostly one-pot recipes are easy to prepare and most can be made in advance.

Pheasant (or guinea fowl or chicken) and barley broth (pictured above)

Prep 15 min

Cook 1 hr 15 min

Serves 4 as a meal

1 pheasant, ideally corn-fed – you could use guinea fowl or any other game bird instead, or even a chicken

1 glass dry sherry

1½-2 litres water, or enough just to cover the bird

4 shallots, peeled and left whole

4 garlic cloves, peeled and left whole

1 bouquet garni, (broth posy), made up of thyme, sage, celery leaf, flat-leaf parsley all tied together into a bunch

1 cinnamon stick

1 star anise

100g barley

100g porridge oats

300g mixed chopped root vegetables – carrots, parsnips, swede, potatoes or any that take your fancy; omit or add what you like, but carrots are essential

1 bunch seasonal greens – kale is especially good here

Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Put the whole bird in a deep, heavy-based pan, add the sherry and enough cold water to cover, then add the herbs, shallots, garlic, cinnamon and star anise. Slowly bring it up to a simmer, then poach on very low heat, so the liquid is barely simmering, for 30 minutes. The essential thing here is to not boil the stock at any point, because that will dry out the bird. You should end up with a poached bird and a lovely, clear, light broth.

Add the barley, oats and chopped root vegetables, and carry on cooking at a very low simmer for 30 minutes, until the grains are cooked through. Add the roughly chopped greens and cook, still on a low, barely simmering heat, for 10 minutes more.

Lift out the bird and carve it into eight pieces – you can take the meat off the bone, too, if you like, but I find it stays juicier on. Return the jointed bird to the pot – if it’s still a little pink on the bone, simmer for a few minutes more, then season to taste and serve.

Brown lentil and chard soup

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stosie Madi’s brown lentil and chard soup.

A delicious, nutritious, warming Lebanese treat that’s usually served on meat-free days and at Lent. The more lemon you can take, the more Moorish the soup.

Prep 10 min

Cook 30 min

Serves 4 as a meal

175g brown lentils

2 medium white onions, peeled, halved and thinly sliced

150ml olive or rapeseed oil

3 large garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced

1 large bunch chard (swiss is great), washed and roughly chopped

Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Juice of 3 large lemons – you will need at least 150ml

Rinse the lentils, then put them in a pot and cover with a litre and a half of cold water. Bring up to a simmer and cook for 20 to 25 minutes , until the lentils are nutty but not soft.

Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large nonstick frying pan until it’s almost smoking. Add the sliced onions and cook, stirring vigorously, on a high heat until deep brown caramel in colour – you’re not looking to soften them, but to crisp them up fast, so they impart their onion sweetness into the oil and dehydrate.

Drain the onions through a fine sieve, reserving the oil. Put the onions on a plate lined with kitchen paper, to soak up excess oil, and pour the reserved oil back into the frying pan. On a low heat, gently fry the garlic slices until golden, then drain, again reserving the oil.

When the lentils are ready, slowly pour the onion and garlic oil into the simmering pot – be careful, because it may spit. Add half the crisp onions and simmer for a further 10 minutes, then stir in the chopped chard, season to taste and cook until the chard is done to your taste.

Just before serving, stir in the fresh lemon juice, then ladle into bowls, sprinkle on the rest of the crisped onions and eat hot.

Ham hock and roast squash soup

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stosie Madi’s ham hock and roast squash soup.

This is the ideal soup to make while you’re watching TV or just pottering about the house.

Prep 10 min

Cook 1 hr 45 min

Serves 4 as a meal

1 small brined ham hock/knuckle (ask the butcher to trim off the fat, but keep the it for cooking), desalinated in a bowl of cold water in the fridge overnight

150ml fresh apple juice, or sweet cider

4 garlic cloves, peeled and left whole

2 sticks celery, roughly chopped

4 shallots, peeled and left whole

1 large bunch sage

2 litres water

1 large butternut squash or 1 small sweet pumpkin

150g butter, to whisk in at the end (optional) – you can just drizzle on a little oil, if you prefer, but butter is much more luxurious

Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Put the ham, apple juice, garlic, celery, shallots and half the sage in a large, deep, heavy-based pan. Add the water, to cover (add a little more if the ham is not quite covered), then bring up to a simmer. Leave to bubble gently over a very low heat for an hour to an hour and a half, until the meat is falling off the bone. Do not add any seasoning at this point, because the ham may already be quite salty.

Meanwhile, heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. Roast the whole squash for 45 minutes to an hour, until soft to the touch and dark brown in colour. Leave to cool completely, then cut it in half, scoop out the seeds (discard or save them for toasting), then spoon out the flesh.

Lift the cooked ham out of the pan. Leave the stock to cook, without boiling, until reduced to one litre. When the ham is cool enough to handle, strip the meat off the bone and cut it into bite-sized chunks.

Put the squash flesh, the rest of the sage and the butter in the reduced stock, then blitz smooth with a hand blender. Taste, season accordingly, then stir in the pieces of ham and serve with good bread and, perhaps, a little blue cheese crumbled over the top so it melts into the soup.

Fish soup

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stosie Madi’s gurnard soup.

If you wanted to make this even quicker and easier, use bought-in fish stock and any white fish fillet.

Prep 15 min

Cook 50 min

Serves 4 as a meal

For the stock

1 small onion, peeled and diced

2 garlic cloves, peeled and diced

2 tbsp rapeseed or olive oil

4 small (or 2 large) gurnards, scaled and filleted (ask the fishmonger to remove the gills, and to give you the head and bones for the stock base), or any firm white fish fillets

1 glass dry white wine

1 bunch flat-leaf parsley

1 bay leaf

1½ litres water

Salt and freshly ground white pepper

For the soup

1 small celeriac, peeled and cubed

100ml cream

50g clarified butter, or 50ml rapeseed oil

2 fennel bulbs, trimmed and sliced

150g waxy potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes

100g spinach leaves

Allioli, homemade or shop-bought, to serve (I make mine with confit garlic and the oil it was cooked in)

In a large, deep, heavy-based pan, saute the onion and garlic in the oil for six or seven minutes, until softened. Add the fish bones and head, the wine, parsley and bay, and add the water. Bring to a rolling boil, cook for 25 minutes, then strain through a fine sieve into a large bowl, season to taste and discard the solids.

Meanwhile, heat the oven to 190C (170 fan)/375F/gas 5. Put the celeriac and cream in a roasting tray lined with a large sheet of foil, season with salt and wrap up in the foil. Roast for about half an hour, until soft and mashable with a fork, then tip into a food processor and blitz to a smooth puree.

In the same stock pan, heat the butter or oil, then saute the fennel and potatoes just to sweat and soften a little. Season with a good sprinkling of salt and white pepper, then return the stock to the pan and cook at a low simmer until the potatoes and fennel are just cooked. Stir in celeriac puree and turn down the heat to avoid it catching. Stir in some allioli to taste, then adjust the seasoning again and stir in the spinach leaves.

Season the fish fillets, gently lay them skin side up on top of the soup, then cover the pan, turn off the heat and leave to cook in the residual heat for eight to 12 minutes, depending on size – essentially, you are steaming them.

Carefully lift out the fish and transfer to a warmed plate. Ladle the soup into bowls, top each serving with two fish fillets (or one if using larger fish) and serve with more allioli, crusty bread and lemon wedges for squeezing over.

"US election week 2020: the good, bad and ridiculous moments",['Victoria Bekiempis'],"From Lizzo reaching for the stars – and stripes – in a powerful Instagram post to Kayleigh McEnany’s false claim about Pennsylvania, here’s what went down this week

The US election saw more than 150 million Americans cast their ballots, some by mail, some waiting in long lines, and then endure a tense wait. There were bound to be quirky moments, some inspiring, some cringeworthy, some simply absurd. Here we pick the good, the bad and the ridiculous.

Good

Lady Gaga may have campaigned with Joe Biden on election day on Tuesday, but Lizzo reached for the stars – and stripes. The music phenom made a powerful post to Instagram, standing majestically in the altogether, only partially draped in Old Glory.

She implored her fans to vote and expressed her optimism that a country rife with inequality and injustice can nevertheless be better. “When I think of this country I don’t think of its laws I think of its people. I think about how we were raised to be patriotic of violence, propaganda & war,” she wrote.

Big turnout and heroic vote counters: the real winners from the US election Read more

“I think about how this country is owned by the oppressor and how the oppressed are locked in a valley of capitalism. But I also think of the young people who refuse to be spoon fed mistruths. I think of the elders who bucked against hateful prejudices even when it felt impossible. Because of you, I’m still hopeful.”

She added: “I believe in restoration of this beautiful land and respecting the communities of people who owned America before colonizers renamed it. I believe in fairness, equality…I believe in so much…we the people, all the people deserve it.”

Bad

The White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, apparently lived up to her internet-anointed nickname, KayLIE, on Wednesday after posting a tweet that prematurely said Donald Trump had won Pennsylvania, while the swing state had not been declared and was still counting votes into Thursday night.

McEnany’s tweet, which read “VICTORY for President @realDonaldTrump in PENNSYLVANIA”, was subsequently flagged by Twitter with a disclaimer warning that “official sources may not have called the race”.

And during a Fox News interview on Wednesday night, McEnany made a false claim about Pennsylvania votes when asked about Trump’s opposition to counting ballots that arrive within three days of election day. (In Pennsylvania, mail-in ballots that are cast by election day, and received by Friday, get counted.)

“They want to count ballots that come in three days after. We have election days in this country for a reason, because votes are counted on Election Day,” the Washington Post reported her saying.

“But Kayleigh, we always have had provisional ballots and military ballots – things that get counted later,” one of the Fox News hosts, Martha MacCallum, responded.

Ridiculous

In Arizona, a false conspiracy theory emerged that ballots filled out with Sharpie felt-tip marker pens handed out at polling places were disqualified, mysteriously harming only Trump.

The controversy was quickly nicknamed Sharpiegate and its basis is not true, the Arizona Republic explained.

The incorrect idea behind it was that the ink would bleed through the paper and prevent a machine from reading it.

But election officials said that scanning machines could read blue or black ink, as well as marker pens, which in fact were used to prevent ink-related issues, Maricopa county explained.

“Did you know we use Sharpies in the Vote Centers so the ink doesn’t smudge as ballots are counted onsite? New offset columns on the ballots means bleed through won’t impact your vote!” they tweeted, with a video explainer."
"When Covid hit, I started walking 20,000 steps a day. It's changed my life",['Isaac Fitzgerald'],"Setting a daily goal made me fitter, boosted my mood and allowed me to explore parts of New York I’d never seen before

It started with an alert on my iPhone. In late June, a notification from the Health App popped up intrusively on my lockscreen.

This year, you’re walking less on average than you did in 2019.

This felt personal. It wasn’t another news alert about politics, or people denying the medical reality of Covid-19. This was my phone, the one I’d paid too much money for and kept cradled close to me like some sort of tiny purebred pet, calling me out for a personal failing.

When I was done being insulted, though, I became uncharacteristically motivated.

I put on a pair of beat-up Vans, strapped on a mask, and headed toward Prospect Park, not far from my Brooklyn apartment. There, I completed the 3.35-mile loop, and felt great afterward. Back in my apartment later that day, the sun setting, I already missed the sense of achievement I felt earlier that morning, so I went for another walk. The next morning, I did it again.

It felt good to move my body. And accomplishing something gave me a jolt of mood-lifting dopamine. In the middle of an achingly difficult year, here was a simple task I could complete – something good for me.

Every morning after I woke, and every evening before bed, rain or shine I headed to the park and put one foot in front of the other.

This was a huge triumph. I’d made many attempts to regularly exercise in my adult life, and until now, nothing had stuck. I committed to a goal: 20,000 steps a day, or about 10 miles. As days turned into weeks turned into months, I didn’t always hit that goal, but it didn’t really matter. I walked every day, and if I logged only 15,000, or even 12,000 steps, still considered it a win.

Not surprisingly, walking day in and day out has had positive, if subtle, effects on my body. I’ve grown sturdier. My leg muscles are a little bigger and harder, and I feel generally stronger and more resilient.

It’s also had a positive effect on my mind. I feel sharper, more alert. My morning walks get me charged up for the day, and my sunset walk gives me a boost going into the evening, where before, I would just lie about, wondering why I was so tired.

While I keep my phone on me – how else can the app track my steps? – I try not to look at it while I’m walking. Taking a break from the tiny, upsetting digital universe I keep in my pocket frees me up to be attentive to the world my body moves through, to notice and connect with other walkers I encounter. One man always wears goggles. Another carries a large ball, sometimes bouncing or kicking or throwing it forward before running to catch up with it. There’s a group of women who must keep to the exact same schedule I do, given how often we run into each other. We all give each other the nod when we cross paths, and it feels good.

The nod I value most comes from a rail-thin, bearded, older man who has always stood out to me. Regardless of the weather, I’d see him walking or running. Struck by his dedication, I did some Googling and found a New York Times article on him. His name is Luis Rios, and he’s been circling the park since 1977. He is my patron saint of walking.

Camaraderie with other walkers has provided a wholesome substitute for something I’ve desperately missed during the isolating pandemic: the sense of community I’ve always enjoyed while hanging out in bars, or working in them, as I did for years. In a way, the park has become my new, much healthier bar.

I’ve become something of an evangelist for my new daily ritual. I talk about it to anyone who’ll listen, encouraging them to join me. More and more often, they do. A friend and I recently crossed the Brooklyn Bridge together, before making our way to Staten Island by ferry. Another friend walked with me to Sunset Park, where we ate tacos and burritos on the steps of a church. These adventures have allowed me to discover so many parts of this beautiful city I’ve never explored before.

As the weather turns colder, and the pandemic persists – keeping us mostly at home and isolated – I plan to bundle up and keep striving toward my 20,000-step daily goal. Walking helped me to transform much of a terrible year into a tolerable one. So much lies ahead that will continue to test us, to traumatize us, to stretch to the breaking point our capacity for madness and uncertainty and horror. So, I’ll keep putting one foot in front of the other. No reason to stop now.

Employers and co-workers want Black women's expertise. But are they paying them for it?,['Tatiana Walk-Morris'],"After a summer of protests, three Black women speak about their experiences being undervalued at work despite being sought out more than ever

After a summer of protests calling to defund the police, protect Black lives, and end systemic racism, many workplaces have publicly acknowledged the need to do better by their Black employees. But progress can be slow: In the months after the George Floyd protests, Black women have taken to social media to call out being asked to do unpaid work or serve as an encyclopedia on racial justice for their inquisitive non-Black co-workers.

For Black women, the experience of being underappreciated or undervalued despite being asked to take on more work is hardly exclusive to the workplace; politically speaking, Black women make up a powerful voting bloc that is often overlooked, despite consistent rates of high voter turnout. They also tend to vote Democrat – a national exit poll found that 91% of Black women voters cast their ballot for Joe Biden, more than any other demographic.

And yet Black women often do not get credit for the (paid and unpaid) work they do, and are met instead with demands for more participation, whether it’s civically or in the workplace. Following this summer of protests, Black employees of all genders have been asked to spearhead diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts at work. Sometimes, as the New York Times reports, Black employees are asked to do this despite the fact that anti-racist education is not their area of expertise. When companies ask their Black workers to lead such efforts – without offering them some kind of compensation or considering whether or not their employees feel like they can really say no – bosses risk replicating the same racist and unfair power structures that they wish to eradicate within their organizations.

This summer served as a point of reflection for many Black women: who is asked to step up at work, and who gets compensated for it? The Guardian spoke to three Black women about their experiences being undervalued at work, despite their expertise being sought out more than ever.

Shardé Davis, 31: ‘If this is the norm, it’s unhealthy’



Location: Hartford, Connecticut

Occupation: assistant professor, communication at the University of Connecticut

I was approached by an organization to help them do work around dismantling racism – specifically anti-Black racism. It happened in June and I remember that, because I believe it happened on Juneteenth. I remember saying to myself: “You are literally asking me to do unpaid work on combating anti-Blackness on Juneteenth.” And this organization absolutely had the ability to pay me. I was truly appalled. I don’t even think it crossed the minds of the people asking me, how inappropriate it was. Most of them were white.

I thought about how I was in grief and mourning death, fearing for my life and the lives of my loved ones because of Covid-19. So this organization had asked me to do this, and I retorted with a question about compensation for my time. Their response is: “Well, this is considered service,” similar to when academics do things like give keynotes, do webinars or research presentations. I had to take the time to explain why I should not be expected to do this kind of work for free, when there are people out there who are specifically trained in anti-racism education and who get paid to do this work for clients. Maybe this is the norm, but if so, it’s an unhealthy norm that’s been created by the professional class in the US.

As an academic, it is part of my job to do service, which, yes, is basically free labor. But it’s common knowledge that Black women and other women of color do more hours of service than our white counterparts. We’re overloaded with service, and oftentimes our service is related to DEI work, even if that’s not our professional expertise.

Bukky Adebayo, 29: ‘People are saying, “I’m asking you as the only Black person I know to help me make sense of this moment”’



Location: Oakland, California

Occupation: senior product manager at GitHub

In the summer of 2016, when Philando Castile died, I was having a conversation with my co-worker. He said something like: “If Black people listened to and followed police instructions, then this shit wouldn’t happen.’” I was trying to explain that it’s actually about how police interact with Black people. It was a small startup, and I was one of maybe two women who worked there [at the time], and the only Black person. .

My co-worker was adamant that he was right, and then he went home and watched the video of Philando Castile. He came back the next day and was like: “I’m sorry, I apologize for being kind of an asshole.” And it was one of those moments when I said to myself: “The work of educating folks on racism in America is not my job.” I got mad. I had to leave at the end of the day. I was like:“You know what? There’s no more work that’s gonna happen. I’m just going to go home and chill.”

I had another co-worker of color who said something in my defense, who tried really hard to get across the point that what our other co-worker was saying was not cool. I hit him up afterwards and thanked him. I’ve been in scenarios where people don’t say anything.

I feel like something acute happened in that moment. Before he watched the Philando Castile video, my co-worker was essentially asking me to justify what was going on in the world, to explain the protests around police brutality . People are legitimately and transparently saying: “I don’t know how to make sense of this moment, and I’m asking you as the only Black person I know to help me make sense of this moment.” In the past, people haven’t been as blatant and upfront about that. [Even then,] I’m trying to help people navigate these questions without them explicitly asking me for that. Because in order for me to work with you, I’m going to [need you to] understand race and gender and the context [of these moments].

Jaila Johnson, 25: ‘Sometimes they will come back with a budget. Sometimes they won’t’



Location: St Petersburg, Florida

Occupation: influencer, K-12 science teacher

I started doing beauty videos after I stopped relaxing my hair and started wearing it naturally. I had graduated high school, started college, and didn’t have anybody that I could just go to and get my hair done or braided up. So I had to teach myself, and that’s when I started making braiding tutorials or twisting tutorials and putting them on YouTube, just to contribute to the online community that I was also benefiting from.

Recently, I went through something with an Amazon vendor that I had worked with previously; I found out that they’d taken one of my videos – it was about how to install passion twists – and shared it on their page without asking me or without even crediting me. They had blurred out my handle from the video; I had a watermark on the video, [but] they blurred that out too. They were using my content to advertise for their business. I was able to reach out to them and get it taken down. When I asked for an explanation of how that happened, their response was something like, “Oh, it was a mistake. It wasn’t communicated properly within our team.”

This happens more often than you think, especially working in the Black hair niche. Going behind a content creator who’s put in time editing their work and then manipulating that content to blur out any trace of their work is intentional.

I shouldn’t have had to find that video and complained for it to get taken down. I don’t know how long it was up [on their page] before that. All I could think of was: how many sales did they make during that time, with my video and my page on your storefront, essentially serving as an advertisement?

Within the larger beauty industry, Black women are still very much undervalued and underpaid. And it’s something that isn’t new, it isn’t surprising, but it’s still disappointing. [It’s] still disappointing to see the numbers. You can have the [right] metrics, you can have 333,000 followers, and still get offered free [beauty] products as compensation.

When I get approached to do unpaid work, I make it clear that I don’t accept free products as payment. I ask something along the lines of, ‘Is there a proposed budget for this?’ And if not, then I move along. Sometimes they will come back with a budget. Sometimes they won’t. To me, it’s no hard feelings. If I wanted to make this my full-time job, would I be able to make a living wage? Because the people who do have significant followers and engagement are still being lowballed and underpaid, especially Black women."

Encrypted emails and documents are protected by both encryption keys and passwords. The bad guys would need to know both to read your stuff.

If you plan to write an email to a Guardian journalist about a sensitive matter, look into PGP encryption. Used properly, PGP should make a message or document unreadable to anyone except the person who sent it and the person for whom it was encrypted. You will use a public key that belongs to the person you are writing to, but is freely available on the internet. This key turns your message into an unreadable jumble. Your recipient – and no one else – has a corresponding private key which can unlock messages that were encrypted by their public key.

Get started

Don’t use your regular email address. Create a new email account solely for corresponding with the Guardian. Do it on a computer that isn’t being monitored, and make sure the sign-up information you provide doesn’t tie the account back to you.

If you’re using a browser-based service such as Gmail, Yahoo! Mail or GMX webmail, look into Mailvelope for encrypting messages in your browser. Two popular applications for encrypting text and documents, which you can then paste or attach to emails, are Gpg4win for Windows and GPGSuite for Mac.

Once you have installed one of these tools you can use it to create your own PGP keys. Keep your private key and password safe and don’t store the two together.

After that

You should encrypt your messages and attachments using both your public key and that of the person you are writing to. All being well, this means that only you and the journalist will be able to decrypt them. You can find Guardian journalists’ keys at theguardian.com/pgp.
